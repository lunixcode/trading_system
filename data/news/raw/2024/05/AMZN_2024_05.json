        "title": "Why I'm Not Selling My Amazon Stock, Even After a 500% Gain",
        "content": "Back in 2016, I started to accumulate shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). I only trimmed my position once over the following eight years, and I'm currently sitting on a gain of nearly 500% on my remaining shares.\n\nAmazon is now my largest position and accounts for 6.5% of my portfolio. I've been tempted to prune that stake again, but I've decided to not sell any more shares for four simple reasons. Image source: Amazon.\n\n1. The flywheel is still spinning\n\nFrom 2016 to 2023, Amazon's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% as its split-adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose at a CAGR of 42%. That growth was driven by the expansion of its online marketplaces and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform.\n\nAmazon subsidized the growth of its lower-margin online marketplaces with AWS' rising operating profits, and that strategy enabled it to expand its Prime ecosystem with loss-leading strategies like discounts, free shipping, and digital streaming services. AWS' support, along with the gradual expansion of its higher-margin advertising business, gives Amazon a wide moat against its less diversified retail competitors. I believe that flywheel effect will continue to drive Amazon's expansion.\n\n2. Its growth rates are stabilizing\n\nAmazon experienced a major growth spurt during the pandemic as more people shopped online and more companies signed up for its cloud-based services. But those tailwinds dissipated as the pandemic passed. Inflation and rising interest rates then curbed consumer purchases and drove many companies to rein in their cloud spending.\n\nIn 2022, Amazon's revenue only rose 9% as it incurred a net loss from its withering investment in Rivian Automotive. But in 2023, its revenue grew 12% as it returned to profitability. That acceleration was driven by the stabilization of its North American and International retail segments -- which benefited from higher delivery speeds, higher ad sales, and its expansion into higher-growth markets. AWS' growth also accelerated again as more companies upgraded their cloud infrastructure to support heavier workloads, large language models, and new generative AI services.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 56%, respectively, as its core businesses stabilize. Simply put, brighter days are ahead as the macro environment improves and its cloud business continues to expand.\n\n3. Its margins are expanding again\n\nAmazon's operating margin declined from 5.3% in 2021 to 2.4% in 2022 as its e-commerce and cloud businesses struggled with the macroeconomic challenges. However, its operating margin rose to 6.4% in 2023 as it laid off tens of thousands of employees, tightly managed its infrastructure costs, and executed other cost-cutting measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt its North American business, Amazon generated more sales from its higher-margin third-party sellers instead of its lower-margin first-party marketplace, consolidated multiple deliveries into single packages, and reduced its logistics costs by regionalizing its networks. Its international operating margins also stabilized it and reduced its expenses, while its advertising business generated higher-margin revenues from its sponsored product and streaming video ads.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon's operating margin to expand to 9.7% in 2024, and then rise to the double digits in 2025 and 2026 as it continually streamlines its business. That's a clear sign that economies of scale are kicking in.\n\n4. It has plenty of long-term growth potential\n\nAmazon's stock might not seem cheap at 40 times forward earnings, but it has plenty of room to grow. The global e-commerce market could still expand at a CAGR of 16% from 2024 to 2029, according to Mordor Intelligence, while Precedence Research expects the global cloud infrastructure market to grow at a CAGR of 12% from 2023 to 2032.\n\nAs the leader of both markets, Amazon could continue to generate double-digit revenue and earnings growth for years to come. It should continue to crush smaller e-commerce and cloud companies as it expands into adjacent markets.\n\nAmazon is still a great long-term investment\n\nAmazon isn't immune to macro headwinds, it could be targeted by regulators, and it faces plenty of competitors. However, I believe it can overcome those challenges -- as it repeatedly did in the past -- and soar even higher over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Hypergrowth Hype Trap: 3 Stocks That Promise Moonshots But Deliver Duds",
        "content": "Hypergrowth stocks have tremendous allure. Investing in just one company like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its early days can lead to life-changing returns.\n\nBut for every Nvidia, there are countless other companies that appeared to have tremendous prospects but were unable to turn that potential into reality. That’s been particularly true in recent years.\n\nThe pandemic caused many companies to enjoy tremendous — but temporary — growth spurts. And the 2021 special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom unleashed many purported hypergrowth companies with dubious underlying fundamentals onto public markets. These are three overhyped growth stocks that have seen their fortunes evaporate as reality sets in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAstra Space (ASTR) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American aerospace company Astra Space on screen in front of web page.. ASTR stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstra Space (NASDAQ:ASTR) is the perfect example of a company that promised investors the stars and but failed to make it off the ground.\n\nThe company offers satellite launch services. In its 2021 SPAC investor presentation, Astra claimed to have a $150 million backlog of commercial orders and a $1.2 billion pipeline within a fast-growing market. Astra expected to deliver investors rapid growth from verticals including broadband, maritime, internet of things, earth observation and government services.\n\nAt the time of its 2021 SPAC deal, Astra’s management projected that the company would generate $256 million in revenues in 2023. Well, 2023 came and went, so how did things actually pan out? Astra Space generated a grand total of $4 million in revenues last year, falling about 98% short of prior expectations.\n\nSeveral operational issues along with a strained balance sheet made it nearly impossible for Astra to carry out its original business plan. Given the company’s tailspin, Astra is reportedly considering filing bankruptcy this year. Ultimately, insiders came forward with a plan to take the company private at 50 cents per share.\n\nAs the stock debuted at a (split-adjusted) $150/share, this deal would lock in a greater than 99% loss for original investors. With ASTR stock still selling above 50 cents today, traders should sell now before either the take-under deal occurs or the company goes bust altogether. In any case, Astra stands as a stark reminder of what happens when unrealistic hypergrowth assumptions come undone.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s right there in the name. What was Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) stock supposed to do? Go up rapidly, of course.\n\nAnd, for a time, that’s exactly what it did. FSLY stock skyrocketed from $20 to more than $100 during the early days of the pandemic. Fastly operates an edge cloud platform that allows app developers and website operators to speed up and optimize their services.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2020, the marginal demand for internet optimization services dramatically outstripped supply as companies sought to get their products and services online as quickly as possible. Fastly’s notable client list included TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nFastly enjoyed tremendous 45% revenue growth in 2020, and traders FSLY stock to the moon. At one point, the company hit a $15 billion market capitalization despite having less than $300 million in annual revenues at the time. At that price, it would have been almost impossible for Fastly to live up to investors’ sky-high expectations.\n\nFastly hasn’t fared quite as poorly as other 2021-era work-from-home winners. Fastly has grown revenues every year sequentially, and is on pace to grow the topline another 10% this year. But Fastly hasn’t yet managed to reach profitability, and its core edge computing services look a lot more like a commodity product today than they did during the early days of the boom.\n\nFSLY stock has dropped more than 90% from the all-time highs. And it is already down more than 50% year-to-date, adding insult to injury, following a couple of downbeat earnings reports. With internet and software spending dramatically slowing down this year, Fastly seems like it will be stuck in the mud for a long time to come.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTV streaming platform Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is another former hypergrowth stock that has now fallen on hard times.\n\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 virus, people were stuck at home and looking to improve their home entertainment setups. Roku enjoyed an unprecedented surge in adoption as folks discovered new media options while the world economy was closed down.\n\nROKU stock blasted off, soaring from $75 to a peak of more than $400. At first, this optimism seemed reasonable, as the company grew revenues from $1.7 billion in 2020 to $2.7 billion in 2021. At that growth rate, anything seems possible.\n\nHowever, revenue growth rapidly decelerated in 2022 and has further lost steam since then. Roku is set for around 12% revenue growth in 2024, which is fine but hardly the sort of thing people were imagining when they paid more than $400/share for the stock a few years ago.\n\nMaking matters worse, Roku is unprofitable now, and analysts see the company remaining unprofitable through at least the year 2026. Roku is seemingly running out of growth runway long before reaching sustainable profitability. That makes ROKU stock a risky bet today, and highlights the perils in paying huge valuations for emerging growth companies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Under-the-Radar Renegades: 3 Stocks Quietly Disrupting Their Industries",
        "content": "Investing today stands out as the most astute financial move. The key question is which investments will yield the highest returns. Often overlooked by institutional investors, certain industry-disrupting stocks are pioneering revolutionary advances and shaking up their industries.\n\nThe current economy is characterized by three defining traits: strength, growth and recovery. This environment makes investing an excellent strategy. Consider these three stocks: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Fair Issac (NYSE:FICO). You might recognize these names from various contexts, but they’re often underestimated in the investment world. These industry-disrupting stocks present significant growth and profit opportunities, particularly because they haven’t yet garnered widespread attention. Their status as “sleepers” means they are prime for early investment. CRWD is an innovator in the cybersecurity industry. It is also at the forefront of digital protection, making it a compelling investment. RIOT specializes in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining, RIOT capitalizes on the profitability of cryptocurrency, positioning itself as a lucrative choice. FICO is known for its strong financials and it offers diversification in the financial sector, enhancing its investment appeal.\n\nAct now — you won’t miss out on the substantial profits these industry-disrupting stocks offer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity defense company developing commercial and B2B products in cyberattack response services. Valued at over $310, CRWD has seen a plethora of consistency in the past year, grossing 135.57% in valuation YOY.\n\nIn the Age of Technology, the Cybersecurity Market is forecasted to grow continuously in this decade, starting right now. In 2023, the industry was valued at $172.32 billion in revenue and projected to rise to $424.97 billion by 2030. CRWD’s market cap was $85.46 billion, with a net gain of over $20 billion noted in year-to-date 2024.\n\nOne of the most vital pull factors for CRWD is the business’s continual success in the financial division. In revenue, CRWD brought in $845.33 million in Q4 fiscal year 2024 (November-January), marking a robust YOY growth of 32.63%. Further, CRWD reported $53.7 in net income or YOY growth of 213.1%. The most considerable growth was in net change in cash, slated for 3,749% YOY growth to $406.2 million.\n\nCrowdStrike continues to take a grip on the cybersecurity industry with its list of large brand collaborators it works with, recently adding Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) to that list. In May of 2024, Amazon partnered with CrowdStrike to integrate its cybersecurity defenses with its website and cloud-based AWS operations to protect assets and user data from breaches. In return for this, CrowdStrike has access to AWS’s AI development resources to further its protection and expand market business in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms is a digital infrastructure and Bitcoin mining firm with a vertically integrated business model. Advancements in new mining facilities being built and increased mining hash rates gives Riot Platforms the potential to change the industry. While the company’s loss per share is +17.7% higher than a year ago, recent growth shows Riot is on the path to success.\n\nWith the age of digital currency arising, the crypto market will inevitably grow in the coming years. The cryptocurrency market is projected to reach $64.41 billion by 2029 — that’s a CAGR of 7.77%. With the crypto market’s future growth, taking a share in Riot is a no-brainer, given their industry-leading advancements.\n\nWith the stock’s current price being $11, analysts are projecting massive growth for Riot in upcoming months. Analysts are projecting a 60% upside potential in the stock, reaching a price of $18. The company’s balance sheet of 0.7% debt and 50% cash and investments in terms of assets was one reason for the growth. Moreover, the algorithms are becoming more efficient, with the hash rate capacity increasing from 12.4 EH/s to 31.5 EH/s by the end of the year, reaching even 100 EH/s by 2027. This innovation has the potential yo triple Riot’s profits from $281 million to $885 million in the next 2 years.\n\nWith Riot Platforms’ efficiency and financial stability progress, the stock is bound to grow, making it a great company to invest in. With the hash rate doubling, Riot has the potential to take over the growing crypto market.\n\nFair Issac (FICO) Button with the word risk pointing between medium and high level, 3D render suitable for risk management or decision-making process situation. represents risk tolerance. industry-disrupting stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac develops analytic, software and digital decision-making technologies and services that enable businesses to automate, enhance and connect decisions internationally.

        "content": "Not all dividend stocks are good, and you should always keep an eye out for dividend stocks to sell if they don’t perform well. Dividend payments from publicly traded companies reached a record $164.3 billion in this year’s first quarter, up 7% from a year ago. Data from the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index shows that many U.S. companies are returning excess cash to shareholders. Blue-chip companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have raised their quarterly dividends. Other companies, such as Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), have paid special one-time dividends.\n\nStill, other companies, such as Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS), have reinstated their dividend after suspending it during the pandemic. Some companies, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have paid their first dividend ever this year. While distributions to stockholders seem to be popular, not every company is joining the party. Some companies have dramatically reduced their dividend or stopped paying one altogether, drawing the ire of investors.\n\nHere are dividend duds: three dividend stocks to sell before they drain your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDividend Stocks to Sell: Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL) The logo for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc (CBRL) is displayed on a restaurant store front.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe only thing U.S. restaurant chain Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL) had going for it was a dividend with one of the highest yields on Wall Street at 9.08%. Unfortunately, Cracker Barrel cut its quarterly payout by 80%, sending investors running for the exits and its share price spiraling downwards. The cut has previously reduced the dividend to 25 cents per share from $1.30.\n\nThe company, which operates a chain of restaurants and gift stores, said the dividend payout is being cut to reallocate capital towards overhauling its brand and stores. The company also warned that its upcoming fiscal third- and fourth-quarter results will likely be below expectations due to weak customer traffic. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store provided no guidance. CBRL stock is down 55% in the last 12 months.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also saw its stock take a big hit after the company cut its quarterly dividend payout to shareholders by nearly 50%. Walgreens lowered its dividend to 25 cents a share from 48 cents, a reduction of 48%. The company said the dividend cut strengthened its long-term balance sheet and cash position.\n\nBefore the cut, Walgreens paid a dividend that yielded more than 7%, which made it the highest-paying dividend stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Note: Walgreens was kicked out of the Dow this spring and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The dividend cut also marked the first time in nearly 50 years that Walgreens reduced its distribution to stockholders. WBA stock has fallen 50% in the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) cut its dividend by 66% to 12.5 cents per share as it looks to redirect cash into building foundries that will design the microchips and semiconductors it and other companies design. While the dividend cut has hurt shareholders’ returns, there is little evidence that it has helped the company or its pivot to become a chip foundry business.\n\nIntel continues to report disappointing financial results and a poor showing for its foundry operations. For this year’s first quarter, the company announced that Intel Foundry had $4.4 billion in revenue, down 10% from a year earlier. Intel also continues to report forward guidance that is below Wall Street expectations. All the bad news has conspired to hurt INTC stock, which has declined 37% in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers",
        "content": "Atlas Air operates a mix of Boeing 747-400 and 747-8 (pictured) freighters, along with 767s and 777s. It will exit 737-800 operations over the next year. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nAtlas Air will stop flying freighter aircraft in Amazon’s domestic parcel network by the middle of next year and concentrate on international widebody service for its growing customer base, which will soon include Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu, CEO Michael Steen said in an interview.\n\nBoth parties have agreed to terminate contracts under which Atlas provides crews, routine maintenance and insurance (CMI) for 25 converted freighters: eight Boeing 737-800s and 17 Boeing 767-300s. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is responsible for providing the aircraft. The contracts were to expire in March 2026.\n\nAt the same time, privately held Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and the e-commerce giant have agreed to extend for three years the leases on 16 B767s operated by Atlas Air, Steen said. The aircraft are owned by Atlas’ leasing subsidiary, Titan Aviation, and were originally leased to Amazon for 10 years. The e-tailer, which separately hired Atlas to fly the aircraft, will be free to transfer the aircraft to another operator that signs a CMI contract.\n\nTitan leases 19 total 767 aircraft to Amazon, including two that are operated by rival Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG). The three aircraft that weren’t extended have extension options.\n\nAmazon directly controls the eight 737-800s, which are leased from AerCap and could also be placed with another cargo airline.\n\nSteen said Atlas Air will reallocate resources to intercontinental operations, where the potential for profits is greater. Toward that end, the airline is adding eight widebody freighters in 2024.\n\nTwo 777 production freighters ordered from Boeing last year are scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter for an undisclosed customer. Ocean shipping giant CMA CGM recently announced that its startup airline has struck a CMI agreement with Atlas Air to operate two Boeing 777 freighters on trans-Pacific routes, starting in the coming months. And Atlas Air recently acquired four previously owned Boeing 747-400 cargo jets that will join the fleet in the third quarter, two of which will be dedicated to Shein and Temu.\n\n“So strategically, as we think about the return on investment on the assets that we’re deploying, we are definitely going for the larger widebody aircraft and the intercontinental market where growth is the strongest,” Steen told FreightWaves.\n\nGlobal e-commerce wants big freighters\n\nAtlas Air currently operates or leases 112 aircraft, including 48 B747-400s, 10 B747-8s, seven B777-200s, with the fleet reaching 120 aircraft by year’s end. Sister airline Polar Air Cargo operates nine widebody jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the market is oversaturated with narrowbody regional freighters, the future is bright for operators of long-haul cargo jets, the CEO declared. Atlas Air currently occupies more than 10% of the global widebody freighter fleet and is well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for industrial goods and electronics, as well as a surge in e-commerce shipments.\n\nSteen pointed to forecasts for compound annual growth rates of 3.5% to 4.5% versus 1% growth in capacity across the industry and a large retirement wave for aging freighters as reasons for investing in large freighters such as the 747 and 777. He has previously said that about 20% of the global fleet of 650 widebody freighters are older than 30 years and nearing retirement.\n\nStructural changes in the passenger sector are also driving the need for more dedicated freighters. About 60% of global air cargo volume moves on all-cargo aircraft and 40% rides in passenger bellies, but according to a study by McKinsey, only 47% of intercontinental belly hold capacity is usable for airfreight because airlines post-COVID have changed cabin interiors to accommodate more premium-class seating, driving passengers to carry more luggage and reducing space for containers. Meanwhile, airlines are also reorienting networks to serve more leisure destinations where cargo demand is limited.\n\nThe boom in shipments from e-commerce platforms and fast-fashion companies in China has become a driving force behind the air cargo market’s recovery and shows no sign of slowing down. E-commerce represented about 19% of global retail sales in 2023 and is on track to capture 41% of the market by 2027, according to Boston Consulting Group.\n\nShein will be the second fast-fashion retailer to sign a long-term dedicated charter agreement with Atlas Air, following Spain-based Inditex. The new breed of fashion houses constantly introduce huge amounts of new products on their websites with very short inventory turnover time, making it important to quickly deliver orders to customers and stores before trends change. Atlas Air already operates dedicated freighters around the world for Alibaba’s logistics arm, while several freight forwarders and Mediterranean Shipping Co.’s new cargo airline use time-chartered aircraft to support their e-commerce customers.\n\n“Their volumes are so large that they need dedicated freighters,” said Steen. “We are their flying warehouse, if you’d like.”\n\nShein and Temu already use Atlas Air for short-term charters, but they will have full control of aircraft starting in the third quarter.\n\nAtlas Air is the largest operator of 747 freighters in the world and added to its lead with the four used 747-400s. Two of the cargo jets were acquired from Silkway West Airlines in Azerbaijan. Two former China Airlines aircraft were picked up from U.S. trader Jetran, as previously reported by trade publication Cargo Facts.\n\nNippon Cargo Airlines last week renewed an agreement with Atlas to operate five of NCA’s 747-400 freighters between Asia and North America amid growing demand. And YunExpress, a freight forwarder in China, in March signed a long-term charter agreement with Atlas for use of a second Boeing 777-200 freighter.\n\nPilot roster\n\nThe phaseout of flying for Amazon will also free up five 767s previously maintained as spares to operate full time for Atlas customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, Steen said. The company plans to soon place some of the medium-widebody freighters with new customers that have signed long-term package leases, which include an aircraft, along with the crew, maintenance and insurance.\n\nSteen dismissed suggestions the airline will shrink its pilot cohort because of the lost Amazon business, noting that it needs about 250 pilots and staff to support the eight large freighters and the incremental increase in 767 flying. He told employees during a company town hall earlier this week that there are no plans to furlough pilots who choose to stay, according to accounts of the meeting posted in pilot chat rooms.\n\n“When we look at reports that a lot of pilots are going to be without a seat, I don’t think that’s going to be the case,” the Atlas chief said.\n\nRelationship with Amazon changes\n\nThe change in Atlas’ partnership with Amazon makes it clear that at least a portion of the 767 fleet will be placed with ABX Air, one of two cargo airlines owned by Air Transport Services Group. In early May, ATSG announced that Amazon will provide 10 additional 767-300 freighters to operate on its behalf under a five-year contract and that ABX will begin flying them in June. ATSG did not say from where Amazon would obtain the aircraft, all of which are expected to be delivered by Dec. 1. Amazon shares eight Boeing 737-800 converted freighters with Atlas Air to operate on its behalf. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nAmazon has the right to place up to 10 more aircraft with ABX, which currently operates four B767-200s for Amazon. Sister airline Air Transport International operates more than 40 767s on Amazon’s behalf.\n\nAmazon owns nearly 20% of ATSG. It previously owned a stake in Atlas Air, but the shares were bought out by the new ownership group. Amazon also dry leases two 767-300s from Titan Aviation that are operated by ATSG carriers.\n\nAmazon’s other providers of outsourced air cargo service in the United States are Sun Country Airlines, which operates 737-800s, and Hawaiian Airlines, with two Airbus A330-300 converted freighters.\n\nSteen declined to provide specifics about the breakup with Amazon over the dedicated transportation agreements, which give Amazon the option to terminate with 180 days of written notice for circumstances such as a change of ownership or performance issues. Penalty clauses can apply to either party for early termination but are likely subject to negotiation. Atlas Air was taken private in early 2023 by a consortium of investors led by Apollo Global Management.\n\nAmazon media representatives didn’t respond to inquiries about changes to the company’s air network. One analyst familiar with airlines that provide outsourced airlift for express delivery companies, who requested anonymity so as not to jeopardize business relationships, expressed skepticism that Atlas would voluntarily give up domestic flying to concentrate on widebody operations while acknowledging new ownership could value the return on investment differently.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\n\nYunExpress charters Atlas Air freighters for US e-commerce service\n\nThe post Atlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Exceptional Growth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "Which are better: growth stocks or value stocks? By the numbers, there's a clear winner, at least in recent years. It's growth stocks, hands down.\n\nIn fact, over the last 10 years, the Vanguard Growth ETF significantly outperformed the Vanguard Value ETF, with an annualized return of 15.2% to 10.2%. VUG Total Return Level Chart\n\nWith that in mind, let's have a look at three growth stocks I think are poised to deliver excellent returns over the long run. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nFirst up is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). Shares of the company, which operates a cloud-based digital advertising platform, have more than doubled in value over the last 18 months.\n\nThe boom in the digital advertising market is to thank. Statista states that in 2023, the digital advertising market was over $600 billion. That figure is estimated to increase to above $870 billion by 2027. The evidence of this growth is all around you.\n\nTake streaming services, for example. After resisting investor calls for an ad-based subscription tier for years, Netflix embraced one -- Netflix's ad tier now has over 40 million monthly active subscribers. Similarly, Disney+ (NYSE:DIS), Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock now have ad tiers.\n\nThat's excellent news for The Trade Desk, whose platform allows advertisers to direct overall ad campaigns and place ads directly on streaming services. Indeed, The Trade Desk has already announced partnerships with Disney and Netflix.\n\nAs for growth, The Trade Desk is growing revenue by 28% year over year as of its most recent quarter (the three months ending March 31, 2024). So, for growth-oriented investors, The Trade Desk is a name to keep an eye on.\n\nVisa\n\nVisa (NYSE: V)operates one of the world's largest payment networks. The company leverages the scale of its network to yield enormous revenue and profits.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the three months ending March 31, 2024), Visa generated $8.8 billion in revenue and $4.7 billion in net income. In turn, the company returned over $3.8 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.\n\nWhat's more, over the last 10 years, Visa cumulatively reduced its overall shares outstanding by about 19%, roughly 2% each year.\n\nThat's great news for investors. As the number of shares outstanding decreases, all else being equal, the value of the remaining shares will increase, thanks to the law of supply and demand.\n\nFinally, Visa isn't just about shareholder returns. The company is still growing rapidly, thanks to its business model, which benefits from rising prices. Over the last decade, Visa averaged revenue growth of 11%, and analysts expect similar growth over the next two years as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nLast, but by no means least, is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). After taking a significant dip in 2022, Amazon's stock is once again riding high and near its all-time high.\n\nOne reason the company's stock is performing well is that its operations are firing on all cylinders.In fact,the company's immense e-commerce business is clearly running more efficiently than ever before. Consider this quote from the company's most recent earnings call:\n\n\"In March, across our top 60 largest US metro areas, ~60% of Prime members' orders arrived the same or next day.\"\n\nIn short, Amazon's massive investments in its fulfillment network -- made during the COVID pandemic -- are paying off. Customers are getting their orders faster than ever.\n\nMoreover, with those large e-commerce infrastructure projects in the rearview mirror, the company is generating more free cash flow than ever before. AMZN Free Cash Flow Per Share Chart\n\nGranted, management signaled that free cash flow will likely dip later this yearas the company invests heavily in upgrading its AI capabilities. However, investors shouldn't fret -- those investments are designed to bolster the market share of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing segment.\n\nFinally, turning to growth, Amazon's revenue continues to soar. The company generated $591 billion in revenue over the last 12 months -- making it second to Walmart for the largest American companies based on revenue. Additionally, analysts expect Amazon to continue growing revenue at a double-digit pace both this year and in 2025. For investors looking for a growth stock with staying power, it's time to consider Amazon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In its latest report, Barclays (LON:BARC) provides a detailed analysis of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s performance in India, highlighting both challenges and growth opportunities. Despite facing a slowdown in certain segments, Amazon India remains a significant player in the country’s burgeoning e-commerce market.\n\nAccording to Barclays, India's overall e-commerce gross merchandise value (GMV) is growing at around 20%, with government estimates pegging it at approximately $120 billion. Amazon holds just under 30% of this market. However, tax filings for the fiscal year ending March 2023 indicate that Amazon India’s B2C revenue grew by a modest 3% year-over-year (y/y), a notable deceleration compared to the pandemic-boosted years.\n\nOffer: Click here and don't miss out on this exclusive offer to access premium features of InvestingPro, including the powerful screeners, fair value calculator, financial health check, etc. and embark on your journey towards financial success. And the best part? It is currently available at a 69% discount, priced at just INR 216/month.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) continues to be a strong performer in India, generating $1.6 billion in revenue with a 43% y/y growth, even after a high 66% y/y growth in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, Amazon Pay’s revenue grew by only 5% y/y to $260 million, down from 17% in the prior year, indicating a loss of market share to other payment options.\n\nBarclays estimates that Amazon India’s GMV for FY23, excluding B2B transactions, stands at around $18 billion, with an overall GMV of approximately $21 billion when including all business segments. This represents a 3-4% decline in USD terms, attributed to the continued reduction of the wholesale business following regulatory changes in 2019.\n\nAmazon India accounts for 4.8% of Amazon's international retail revenue but also 11% of its international operating income losses. For calendar Q1 2023, India generated $5.6 billion in revenue (up 1% y/y) and incurred $0.9 billion in pre-tax losses. Notably, Amazon has significantly reduced its total international operating income losses, with a substantial decrease from -$7.7 billion to -$0.5 billion year-over-year, thanks to cost-saving measures in mature international markets outside India. Barclays expects the operating income in India to stabilize without much fluctuation in the future.\n\nGovernment data suggests steady e-commerce growth in India at around 20% for 2024, consistent with last year, potentially reaching just over $120 billion in GMV. Other estimates, such as the Google-Tamasek-Bain study, suggest a lower figure, but Barclays relies on IBEF data for its global e-commerce industry model.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndia's per-capita e-commerce spending is still significantly lower than in Western markets due to lower income levels, but the trend is improving. A recent Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) study projects India’s B2C e-commerce GMV to grow at a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), driven by a growing online shopper base and increasing per-capita consumption. Improvements in digital infrastructure and increasing digital-first habits among Tier 2+ populations are also contributing to this growth. However, challenges remain due to low population density and diverse consumer profiles in these areas.\n\nA Nielsen study commissioned by Amazon India reveals that Amazon.in is the preferred shopping destination for 68% of consumers during the annual festive season. Over 78% of consumers trust online shopping, with Amazon.in identified as the most trusted and convenient online brand.\n\nIn summary, despite regulatory challenges and market slowdowns, Amazon India demonstrates resilience with significant market share and steady revenue streams in AWS. The company's strategic focus on digital infrastructure and consumer trust continues to position it well in the evolving Indian e-commerce landscape.\n\nUnlock the true value of stocks with InvestingPro by clicking here – your ultimate stock analysis tool!

In exchange for this stability and consistency, you generally will see relatively little price appreciation for REIT stocks, which can sometimes cap the potential upside of your investment.\n\nREITs also aren’t valued by regular price multiples like other stocks. Instead, REITs use a metric called “Funds From Operations” or FFO. This is a better indication of how financially healthy a REIT company is.\n\nGenerally, REIT stocks are best suited for investors with a conservative strategy and low-risk tolerance. They are also beneficial for investors in or nearing retirement and seeking to produce income from their investments. However, any portfolio looking for just a touch of stability can benefit from strong REIT exposure. As such, this article will highlight three such REIT picks that you should consider adding to your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) Image of computer servers lined up in a dark room\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is a REIT that focuses on owning and operating data centers. It rents out the spaces and facilities needed for companies to store equipment and build up data centers. Overall, Wall Street remains bullish on DLR with an average analyst price target of $147.53 and a street-high target of $175.00.\n\nThe demand for data centers to run advanced technologies like AI and machine learning has never been higher. One only needs to look at the recent earnings report from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). The AI leader reported a 400% year-over-year growth in its data center revenue from 2023. Not surprisingly, Digital Realty and NVIDIA already have a strong partnership in place that is set to synergize into more long-term growth.\n\nDLR has managed to continue to grow its FFO by a compounding annual growth rate of 11% from 2005. As of May 2024, it sits at an impressive $6.60 to $6.75 per share. With over 300 data centers under its control, Digital Realty is set to thrive from the rising demand for AI from some of its partners including Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. As a cherry on top, DLR pays a quarterly distribution with a current yield of 3.42%.\n\nCrown Castle International (CCI) a ground-up view of multiple cell towers in a circle\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCrown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) is a REIT that rents out cellular towers and infrastructure to telecommunications companies. Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $110.87 for CCI which represents nearly 15% upside from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis REIT company owns more than 40,000 cellular towers and over 90,000 miles of fiber optic internet cable. One unique aspect of Crown Castle is that it operates solely in the United States. This sets CCI apart from other wireless infrastructure REITs like American Tower (NYSE:AMT). This localization to just the U.S. has also allowed Crown Castle to be the go-to REIT when renting out towers to major American telecom companies like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and AT&T (NYSE:T).\n\nIf there is one thing Crown Castle cares about, that’s returning capital to shareholders. This REIT pays a quarterly distribution with a current yield of 6.38%. Crown Castle also has a long-term dividend growth target of 7% to 8% annually. With an impressive trailing twelve months FFO per share of about $7.50 to top it off. Thus, it would be foolish not to keep this company on your watchlist.\n\nWP Carey (WPC) a wooden house shape holds 3 bags of cash representing reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWP Carey (NYSE:WPC) is one of the world’s largest diversified net lease REIT companies in the world. The one-year price target range for this REIT is $55.00 to $65.00 with an average analyst target of $59.78. The high end of the range indicates a nearly 20% upside from the current price of WPC.\n\nSo what exactly is a net lease REIT? WP Carey purchases properties from companies and then immediately leases them back for a monthly rental fee. This allows the companies to raise money and capital while providing WP Carey with a reliable and trustworthy tenant. Recently, the company has chosen to exit the office sector in hopes of entering a transformational phase to replace its portfolio with stronger growth prospects.\n\nWith its business model producing such reliable rental income, it shouldn’t be a surprise that WPC pays a quarterly distribution with a yield of 6.09% to shareholders. While its recent FFO of $1.14 per share dipped slightly YOY, we remain certain that WPC is a great long-term investment that is transforming into a higher-growth diversified pick.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Inflation Relief: Which Retail Giants Are Slashing Prices?",
        "content": "The topic of inflation relief is one most consumers can get behind. Inflation has been stickier than many expected, particularly in key categories. Indeed, when we’re talking about essentials such as food and consumer staples, there isn’t much consumers can do. However, a number of companies are seeing this inflationary environment as one that can be beneficial, if there’s room to cut prices.\n\nWe’re now seeing evidence more price cuts are taking hold, as companies look to attract more consumers to shop both online and physically in stores. Generally, the items seeing the most significant price cuts are essentials, frozen goods and other discretionary purchases.\n\nIncreasing prices because of inflation has led to cautious spending from consumers. Many shoppers are now prioritizing needs over wants, setting a tight budget for shopping. This shift has been a challenge for the U.S. economy, which is currently relying heavily on consumer spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInflation is still hovering around 3.4% in March, a 0.3% increase from February, as per data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. NerdWallet says from January 2020 to April 2024, consumer price inflation has totaled close to 20%. For those in the lower income brackets, that’s not a good thing.\n\nThat said, let’s dive into where consumers are seeing the most inflation relief, and from which retailers, right now.\n\nWalgreens\n\nReducing over 1,500 items, including toiletries, snacks and toys, Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) is among the top pharmacy retailers that have announced price slashes.\n\nCompetitors like Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have similarly cut prices. Some items worth looking out for are gummy vitamins and chips now selling for $11.99 and $1.99, respectively.\n\nTracey Brown, Walgreens retail president, said the company decided to support customers under financial strain; hence, the price reductions. After announcing excellent second-quarter sales expectations, WBA lowered its full-year earnings forecast due to a shift in the retail environment.\n\nThe company’s next earnings report is expected in June, but currently, shares are down 40% this year. Walgreens’ recent earnings report showed a 4.5% drop in retail sales and a 4.3% drop in sales year-over-year.\n\nTarget\n\nTarget has rolled out substantial price cuts on approximately 5,000 popular items. Having already slashed prices on 1,500 products, more reductions are in store for the summer, aiming to save consumers millions. Rick Gomez, the executive vice president, emphasized that these cuts, covering essentials such as milk, meat and diapers, reflect Target’s commitment to competitiveness and aiding consumers in managing their budgets.\n\nStory continues\n\nTarget offered lower prices on household essentials, helping consumers save during Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and back-to-school shopping. Examples of these price cuts included Good & Gather frozen chicken breasts and other frozen products. These reductions included Memorial Day discounts to help consumers celebrate the holiday.\n\nThe company reduced prices on national and popular in-house brands like Good & Gather and Everspring in critical departments such as food, household essentials and health products. New prices, marked with red tags, are accessible in-store, online and through the Target app.\n\nExamples include Good & Gather unsalted butter at $3.79 (previously $3.99), Prime Hydration sports drinks at $1.99 (previously $2.19) and Clorox scented wipes at $4.99 (previously $5.79).\n\nAldi\n\nThis summer, Germany-based Aldi cut prices on 250+ items, addressing inflation worries to keep shopping affordable. Dave Rinaldo, Aldi U.S. president, stressed the need for discounts on seasonal essentials like picnic and BBQ items.\n\nAldi announced on May 2 its intention to cut prices, aiming to save customers around $100 million, nearly twice the savings from a similar initiative last year, which amounted to over $60 million.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThese price cuts from retail giants only aim to stimulate spending amidst inflation concerns. Restaurant chains like McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) introduced fixed-price meal deals, while Michaels permanently reduced prices on popular items by up to 40%.\n\nDespite an unexpected uptick in consumer confidence in May, lingering uncertainties remain about the impact of these discounts. Retailer bankruptcies peaked last year, but empty storefronts are quickly filled due to limited retail space availability.\n\nGrocery chains face significant profit challenges due to small shifts in transaction volume and purchase quantity. While price reductions offer relief, they follow a substantial 26.6% price hike since 2019, compared to a mere 1.6% increase over the preceding five years.\n\nConsumers continue to feel inflation’s impact, as most still compare current grocery costs to pre-pandemic levels, leading to “register shock” at checkout. This trend is expected to persist.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Unearthing Unknown Stocks: 3 Picks That Could Be the Next Big Thing",
        "content": "Sometimes the next big thing stocks to buy and hold are flying well under the radar.\n\nLook at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). When Apple went public in 1980, it was an unknown stock that nearly filed for bankruptcy. All thanks to financial instability and fierce competition. Since then, it’s become a household name worth $2.92 trillion, making some of its biggest holders filthy rich.\n\nOr, look at Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA). At one point, no one knew what MARA was, or even why they should be excited about a Bitcoin mining stock. But once the opportunity was discovered, the miner exploded from about 62 cents to a recent high of $20.25.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt one point, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was an unknown. So much so, that Jeff Bezos had to convince his siblings to invest $10,000 each in the now $1.9 trillion stock. Needless to say, it was a wise move.\n\nDo stocks like these still exist? You bet.\n\nAre they easy to spot? Nope. Just as we saw with Apple, Marathon, and Amazon, you have to dig through a lot of garbage, do your due diligence, and have a good deal of patience. So, no, not easy at all. But here are a few unknown stocks that may have similar potential.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) wasn’t one of the most well-known stocks in the telecom world.\n\nBut that quickly changed earlier this week. All after ASTS, which is building the first global cellular broadband network in space, inked a deal with Verizon (NYSE:VZ). With a commitment of $100 million from Verizon, the two companies will provide direct-to-cellular Space Mobile service when needed for Verizon customers.\n\nThe two are attempting to improve cellular services all over the U.S. “We will now be able to use our spectrum in conjunction with AST’s satellite network to provide essential connectivity in remote corners of the U.S. where cellular signals are unreachable through traditional land-based infrastructure,” said Srini Kalapala, Verizon’s senior vice president of technology and product development, in the release.\n\nEven better, it also inked an agreement with AT&T (NYSE:T) earlier this month to provide its space-based network directly to cell phones. All of which is a major commercial milestone for ASTS.\n\nStructure Therapeutics (GPCR) An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around it\n\nSource: ra2 studio/Shutterstock\n\nStructure Therapeutics (NASDAQ:GPCR) isn’t a well-known weight loss treatment stock just yet. But it may soon be. According to JPMorgan, it’s an overlooked player in the weight loss treatment market. The firm has an overweight rating on the stock, with a price target of $65.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We think the opportunity for oral GLP-1s is underappreciated and think this market could generate $30bn in sales by 2035,” added the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “GPCRs lead asset, 1290, is a pure-play option for this opportunity, and even a small share would support substantial upside to the stock.”\n\nBetter, its addressable market is substantial. According to the World Obesity Federation, “In its World Obesity Atlas 2023, the federation said the economic impact of overweight and obesity on the world is set to reach $4.32tn—nearly 3% of global gross domestic product.”\n\nMuch like we’ve seen with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX), the upside can be explosive. Even better, with new weight loss treatments, the market could be worth $100 billion by 2030, says Goldman Sachs.\n\nFluence Energy (FLNC) Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buy\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile a good number of us are familiar with Fluence Energy (NASDAQ:FLNC) at this point. It’s still under-appreciated, especially with an increase in artificial intelligence-driven electricity demand.\n\nUBS analysts have a buy rating and a $32 price target on FLNC. They also note it’s “poised to benefit from the growing demand for electricity by AI data centers,” as noted by Investing.com. “Fluence Energy’s role as a significant supplier is seen as undervalued, particularly in the context of the shift towards 100% renewable energy policies by corporations.”\n\nGoldman Sachs also included FLNC on its list of stocks to buy, with data center demand expected to rise. The “U.S. power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation. Not since the start of the century has U.S. electricity demand grown 2.4% over an eight-year period, with U.S. annual power generation over the last 20 years averaging less than 0.5% growth,” Goldman Sachs added.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Although there is no hard-and-fast rule about what constitutes a blue-chip stock, they all tend to have certain qualities. They are large, financially stable companies that have been through numerous business and economic cycles that proved their worth in the end.\n\nThe upper echelon of the S&P 500 are the sort of stocks that comprise blue-chip stocks. Yet investors need to be careful because “blue-chip” doesn’t always mean the same thing to everyone. The T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:TCHP), for example, includes Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that are easily recognizable blue-chip stocks. Yet the exchange-traded fund (ETF) also includes some head-scratchers like Carvana (NASDAQ:CVNA).\n\nWhat follows are three blue-chip growth stocks that most investors would agree fit the definition and offer significant opportunities for substantial wealth creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough some might put Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) in the same category as Carvana, the ride-share leader is a solid, financially sound business that continues growing. Its brand is known globally and it’s name has become a verb for people wanting a ride somewhere, even when they are using competing services.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 15% to $10.3 billion as gross bookings surged 20% to 37.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rocketed 82% higher for the period, hitting nearly $1.4 billion as Uber generated almost $1.4 billion in free cash flow.\n\nHaving expanded beyond just simple ride-hailing services, Uber Technologies now also delivers food, groceries, packages and even freight. It is also investing heavily into driverless vehicles and the nascent electric vehicle takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft industry. The self-driving car initiative would dramatically boost revenue and profits as the company would no longer need to split fares with drivers.\n\nWith Uber Technologies stock down 22% from recent highs and earnings expected to grow 47% annually for the next five years, the ride-share leader is a blue-chip growth stock with a bright future.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt doesn’t garner the kinds of headlines as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) but chipmaker Marvell Technologies (NASDAQ:MRVL) is carving out a new path for itself in artificial intelligence (AI). Best known as a maker of semiconductors for the fiber optics industry, the chipmaker is applying its electro-optical expertise to develop AI chips for data centers. For example,  Marvell’s Nova 1.6 terabytes per second PAM4 electro-optics platform — an industry first for speed — enables the high-speed movement of data in AI, machine learning (ML) and data center networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarvell is racking up wins with hyperscalers and recently announced its third hyperscale cloud customer for its custom chip business. Wall Street analysts think the chipmaker has already won over the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google as customers.  It shows how Marvell’s pivot to new verticals like data center infrastructure provides a new foundation for long-term growth. The data center industry is positioned for significant expansion and Marvell Technology will be riding the wave higher.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nDrugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) already caught its own wave of opportunity, as treatments for diabetes and obesity created a tsunami of epic proportions. Mounjaro and Zepbound use terzepatide as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist to treat the conditions. The response has been phenomenal.\n\nGlobal Mounjaro sales more than tripled to $1.8 billion in the first quarter following U.S. approval, while Zepbound drew in $517 million in sales in its first full quarter after approval. The twin therapies helped Eli Lilly raise its 2024 guidance by $2 billion to a range of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion.\n\nThe pharmaceutical stock also has a portfolio of existing treatments and a pipeline of drugs in clinical trials. Eli Lilly is also willing to buy what it needs to plug any holes. Last year it bought radiopharmaceutical company Point Biopharma for $1.4 billion and just announced it will invest $60 million into Atkis Oncology to gain access to its miniprotein platform to develop anticancer radiopharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceuticals are a new class of cancer drugs containing radioactive isotopes to deliver radiation therapy directly to cancer cells.\n\nEli Lilly struck gold with Mounjaro and Zepbound but that’s not the only place place the drugmaker is panning for riches.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Whole Foods founder John Mackey credits psychedelics for business inspiration: ‘It was always a spiritual thing for me’",
        "content": "For John Mackey, popping into a Whole Foods while he's traveling elicits a twinge of nostalgia. “It’s a little bit weird,” says the founder and former CEO of the empire, who stepped down in 2022 after 44 years at the helm.\n\n“I don't feel relief,” he says. “I don't think I really feel sad, either.” Instead, explains Mackey, who recently stopped into Fortune’s New York office to discuss his new memoir, The Whole Story: Adventures in Love, Life, and Capitalism, “It's like a child. When the child is grown up, I still love my child. But the child has its own life, its own destiny. And I'm really proud of how it's grown up and how it's how it's leading its life.”\n\nIn his book, Mackey, 70, details the birth and early life of the company, from its humble hippie beginnings in an three-story Victorian house in Austin, Tex., to its phenomenal growth into a chain of 540 stores across the U.S., U.K., and Canada, purchased by Amazon for $13.7 billion in 2017.\n\n“This was my last gift to Whole Foods Market,” the Houston native says of his tome. “The idea being that this is our story, and not just this big corporation—that it didn't start that way. It has a history and a personality.” Writing it provided personal closure for Mackey. “I got to relive a huge chunk of my life,” he says, adding that he also decided to write the book because he wanted “to inspire people.”\n\nAs for what inspired the entrepreneur, the list is long—and psychedelic drugs, which make several appearances in the book, are high up on it.\n\n“People could get the wrong impression that I was tripping all the time, but that's really not accurate,” he says. “It was always a spiritual thing for me.”\n\nTurning on and Tuning In\n\nMackey counts on one hand the times he’s done psychedelics and recalls how each one was a revelation—starting when he dropped acid with friends at 19, as a student at Trinity University in San Antonio. \"It knocked me off my life path\" of becoming a doctor or a lawyer at the behest of his mom, he recalls. “I had an awakening to the fact that there's a deeper spiritual reality … I started reading Eastern religions and Eastern thinkers.” He began studying philosophy at the University of Texas, “seeking the meaning of life.”\n\nSeveral years later, while high on MDMA (aka ecstasy or Molly) at a New Age gathering in Austin, he recalls, “I realized—and I've never forgotten—that love is the most important thing in life. There's just nothing that compares to it … And so that caused me to want to create a more loving culture and Whole Foods.” Next came devotion to the New-Age bible A Course in Miracles, getting seriously into meditation, and, decades later, after reading Michael Pollan’s How to Change Your Mind, going on a guided MDMA-psilocybin trip to help Mackey through the transition of leaving Whole Foods.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I got over some relationships that had been damaged that I was able to heal up. And it was a very, very smart thing to do,” he says. Mackey also became committed to breathwork, the yoga-rooted practice he had started exploring back in the 1980s, which has had a similarly deep impact on his psyche. \"The Whole Story: Adventures in Love, Life and Capitalism\" by John Mackey\n\n“Breathwork is a very simple, safe way to have a transcendent experience,” says Mackey. “People don’t realize that just by breathing in the right setting, you can have a deeper connection to your soul.”\n\nOther epiphanies for Mackey fall under what he calls “food awakenings.” The first was in 1976—after moving into a vegetarian co-op, adopting a mostly vegetarian diet, and establishing his first health-food store. Another came in the early aughts when he went vegan, in part inspired by PETA and other activists targeting Whole Foods for working with a supplier involved in foie gras production.\n\n“It was a process,” he explains of his move to veganism. “I was reading all these books—The Suffering of Animals, Dominion: The Power of Man, tons of others—and a thought began to pop in my mind, from deep within my being, that said, ‘Why aren’t you a vegan? Why are you killing animals? Why?’ And it never left. It just got stronger as time went on until I realized that I just knew that it was the right thing for me personally.”\n\nEnter Love.Life\n\nNow Mackey’s excited to share his revelations with the rest of the world through his newest venture: Love.Life, a brand of wellness clubs that will offer, among other treatments, meditation, breathwork, and psychedelic therapy—as soon as that’s legal.\n\n“Our first one will be in California. It's not legal there yet, but it's just a matter of time,” he says. “You know why? Because the science is pretty clear that a combination of psilocybin and MDMA is incredibly effective against PTSD.”\n\nLove.Life \"is a continuation of my own personal, higher purpose in life. It's part of my own hero's journey,” he says, lamenting the idea that most people don’t see a doctor until they are sick, and that our medical system generally “just treats symptoms of chronic diseases.”\n\nMackey’s idea is to create “one-stop holistic health membership clubs,” the first of which will open July 9 in El Segundo, Calif. On offer will be a panoply of treatments and activities geared toward wellness worshipers: a fitness center including Pilates and yoga; a spa with massage, facials, wraps, peels, cryotherapy, infrared saunas and hyperbaric oxygen chambers; and three pickleball courts, as Mackey is a recent convert.\n\n“The very first time you play it, you will have fun, as the threshold for enjoyment is at the very beginning,” says Mackey, whose other fitness go-to is long-distance hiking—a passion that's only grown since completing the Appalachian Trail (twice) and the Pacific Crest Trail many years ago. \"You're immersed in nature for weeks at a time, and your your heart rate changes, your consciousness changes,\" he says, not to mention that \"a lot of my best ideas come when I'm out on a hiking trip.\"\n\nLove.Life will also have a medical center staffed with physicians trained in both Eastern and Western modalities. “The vision is, ideally, people will join, we'll take them through a battery of tests so we can establish a baseline health,” he says. “The average person has no idea if he or she is very healthy, because the doctors say ‘you're doing okay,’ but we want to know exactly where you are.” Test results will be used to create a precise, personalized health plan. “If they need to heal, we'll help them heal,” Mackey says. “If they're looking for max performance, we can get them to max performance. If they're aging baby boomers, we can help extend their healthspan and lifespan.”\n\nFinally, there will be a health-focused restaurant—which will not be plant-based but “plant-forward,” something Mackey explains as a sort of compromise.\n\n“Love.Life opened a vegan restaurant already in L.A. and it failed,” he says. “By offering a plant-forward menu with the option to add on high-quality animal foods that are responsibly sourced for a higher level of animal welfare, we’re being inclusive of our wider membership community and their dietary preferences. While we deeply value the plant-based community and I personally will always choose to be an ethical vegan, we need to meet the market where we find it, in order to have a successful business.\"\n\nMackey’s aim is to grow the first Love.Life location into a chain—one that he hopes will do for doctor’s offices what Whole Foods did for supermarkets.\n\n“People that are young don't have any idea how bad supermarkets were. They were horrible, and people hated to go in them,” he says. That's why, for the first few years that Whole Foods existed, people would come in and be blown away.\n\nIt’s the reaction he’s hoping for with Love.Life.\n\n“People are going to say, ‘We've never been in a place like this, this is really cool. How come nobody's done this before?’ It'll be obvious, retrospectively, that it should have been happening.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Growth stocks are a great way to buy into a potential market bull run this year, should the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts occur. The Fed has hinted that rates could go down up to three times in 2024 from 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in 22 years. The markets are now looking to the next Fed meeting in June for more updates.\n\nIf the Fed does what is expected and earnings keep going up without the economy going into a slump, the stock market could have a broad-based bull market. Fourteen of the 20 biggest stock markets in the world have already notched record highs this year, with U.S. stocks currently on a $12 trillion rise.\n\nSo far, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are leading the charge. After slowing down in 2023, Fidelity thinks earnings growth will pick up again in 2024, helping sustain the bull market with more inclusive stock market gains across sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEveryone is buying NVDA stock, but as we shall see, there are solid growth stocks rated a “strong buy,” have double-digit upsides, and have strong sales growth that are up for grabs. These growth stocks include a top e-commerce play with dominant cloud infrastructure, a cybersecurity firm with advanced security solutions, and an ambitious electric vehicle maker rapidly expanding its model line despite financial instability.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit a new record high in May, attributable to Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy’s confidence in Amazon’s abilities in generative AI and good Q1 earnings.\n\nThe upgraded Amazon Q now allows non-developers to build applications using natural language. AMZN also plans to add creative AI technologies to Alexa and charge a monthly subscription. At the same time, AWS Bedrock AI can now import and access custom AI models.\n\nIt’s important that Amazon keep adding to AWS, which accounts for 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market and has a $100 billion annual revenue run rate, more than any other cloud provider. AWS generated 54% of Amazon’s $13.21 billion operational profits in Q4 2023, representing 14% of Amazon’s income.\n\nMoving away from AWS, Amazon has also signed multiple long-term deals with Seattle Kraken hockey games and NBA games to boost its Prime offering.\n\nOverall, on the retail side, Amazon is still getting a big chunk of new spending, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) experts say that the company is becoming even more competitive.\n\nAccording to the most recent report, the global e-commerce company made almost $576 billion in net sales, up from $514 billion the previous year, primarily from online retail sales; consensus points to a potential 21% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) operates in cybersecurity, an important part of the world economy that will grow by 11% from 2024 to 2028 and reach $273 billion in value by 2028; it holds about a 24% share of the endpoint protection market.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon platform continues to bring in new customers, as shown by the 34% year-over-year growth in yearly ongoing income revealed in the most recent earnings.\n\nCrowdStrike’s fourth-quarter 2024 earning-per-share was 95 cents, well over the expert expectation of 82 cents, and revenues were $845 million, higher than the $839 million predicted.\n\nOn the product side, CrowdStrike showed off its Falcon Next-Gen SIEM system for the first time at the RSA Conference 2024. CrowdStrike also put out Falcon for Defender, which protects Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Defender setups by constantly looking for risks.\n\nCrowdStrike and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud are also working together more closely to improve AI-based hacking incident response and MDR using Falcon and Mandiant. In addition, CrowdStrike and NinjaOne are working together to offer full computer protection.\n\nCrowdStrike’s revenue for 2024 was around $3 billion, 36% more than in 2023; consensus points to an around 16% upside, enhancing its appeal among growth stocks to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car.

Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith 800,000 cars to deliver in 2024, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) wants to double the number of cars it delivered last year.\n\nThe Chinese new energy vehicle company is also planning to have more than 5,000 supercharging sites online by 2025, spread out across 90% of major highways and 90% of the core urban areas in Tier 4 and more developed towns.\n\nThe new L6 SUV from Li Auto is also exciting investors. LI stock went up because the upscale electric SUV starts at $34,500. The price is relatively affordable within the premium electric SUV market, and the new model received over 10,000 orders within 72 hours of debuting.\n\nHowever, the stock is down 41% because Q1 2024 vehicle sales missed analyst estimates, and its electric SUV launch is delayed until the second half of 2025 due to infrastructure issues.\n\nAnalysts, however, expect a turnaround for the first major China EV startup to turn a profit, projecting an upside of 76%, making it can’t miss among growth stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Gains on Fulfillment Strength Led by Robotics",
        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN shares have gained 19.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Retail & Wholesale sector’s return of 9%. The e-commerce giant is continuously gaining momentum in the booming online shopping space on the back of its distribution strength and expanding fulfillment network. Amazon currently has 110 fulfillment centers in the United States and 185 such facilities globally.\r\n\r\nThe company’s deepening focus toward aiding automation at its fulfillment centers on the back of Amazon Robotics remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nTo maintain its dominant position in the e-commerce market, Amazon needs to continue investing more in fulfillment centers in the United States and the international regions.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company recently inaugurated a robotics fulfillment center called YYC4 in Canada, located in Calgary, Alberta.\r\n\r\nThis facility, spanning 2.8 million square feet, is designed to improve the work efficiency and safety of workers through automated systems and robots. YYC4 is equipped with RWC4 robotics technology, which aids in sorting totes and constructing pallets for shipping. Amazon has also deployed a trolley called Kermit that transports empty totes.\r\n\r\nThe company strives to offer in-demand skill training, create job opportunities and fulfill customer orders as fast as possible with the help of advanced robotics technology.\r\n\r\nWith the launch of YYC4, Amazon has expanded its presence in Canada. It now has five fulfillment centers, one sortation center, three delivery stations and two AMXL delivery stations in Alberta.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nRobotics Fulfillment Strength to Aid Growth\n\nRobotics that utilize AI and ML techniques are becoming mainstream in the retail industry. Per a report from Maximize Research Report, the global market for retail robotics is expected to witness a CAGR of 32.5% between 2023 and 2029.\r\n\r\nAmazon remains well-poised to capitalize on this growth prospect on the back of its increasing number of robotics fulfillment centers worldwide.\r\n\r\nPer the first-quarter 2024 earnings release, the company operates robotics fulfillment centers in 11 countries, and they help improve workplace ergonomics, and reduce heavy lifting and repetitive tasks.\r\n\r\nAmazon intends to open such facilities in Asturias, Spain and Sagamihara City, Japan.\r\n\r\nThe company’s concerted efforts in advancements of its retail and fulfillment robots are other positives.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s introduction of a mobile robot, namely Titan, which is designed for lifting up to 2,500 pounds in its fulfillment centers, is noteworthy. The company’s robotics technology also includes Sequoia, which helps identify and store inventory received at the fulfillment centers up to 75% faster than humans. This way, it helps increase the number of goods delivered the same day or next day.\r\n\r\nGrowing fulfillment robotics strength is expected to aid Amazon in driving its customer momentum in the e-commerce space. This, in turn, will drive growth in its online store sales, which stood at $54.7 billion in first-quarter 2024, up 7% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same metric for 2024 is pegged at $244.8 billion, indicating growth of 5.6% from the 2023 reported level.\r\n\r\nStrengthening online store sales will, in turn, aid Amazon’s overall financial performance.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 sales is projected at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $4.58 per share, suggesting year-over-year growth of 57.9%. The estimate has been revised upward 11.7% over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nIn regard to competition, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, with its expanding robotics capabilities, has intensified the battle for Walmart WMT, which is trying to narrow down its gap from Amazon in the e-commerce category.\r\n\r\nWalmart’s growing deployment of moving shelf-scanning robots, which are capable of detecting any shelving error across its stores in the United States, remains noteworthy. The company is also accelerating the use of automation across its supply chain.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the retail-wholesale sector are The Gap GPS and Coupang CPNG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Gap has gained 2.8% in the year-to-date period. GPS's long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 12%.\r\n\r\nCoupang shares have gained 73.2% in the year-to-date period.

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Up 1.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Amazon (AMZN). Shares have added about 1.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Amazon due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nAmazon's Q1 Earnings & Sales Beat Estimate\n\nAmazon.com delivered first-quarter 2024 earnings of 98 cents per share compared with 31 cents in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nAMZN’s net income, totaling $10.4 billion, is inclusive of a pre-tax valuation loss of $2 billion in non-operating expenses associated with its investment in Rivian Automotive.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted bottom-line figure was $1.13 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.1%.\r\n\r\nNet sales of $143.31 billion rose 13% year over year. The figure came closer to the higher end of the management’s guidance of $138-$143.5 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion.\r\n\r\nAmazon witnessed a $0.2 billion impact of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum across North America and International segments contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe growing momentum of the Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) segment contributed well.\r\n\r\nStrength in the advertising business also benefited the company in the reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAWS’s growing investments in generative AI are likely to continue aiding it in gaining momentum among cloud customers in the near term.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s strong global presence, growing Prime momentum, improving Alexa skills, expanding smart device portfolio, and increasing efforts toward gaining strong traction among small and medium businesses are likely to drive its financial performance in the days ahead.\n\nTop-Line Details\n\nProduct sales (42.5% of sales) increased 6.9% year over year to $60.9 billion. Service sales (57.5% of sales) rose 17.1% from the year-ago quarter to $82.4 billion.\r\n\r\nBy segment, North America revenues (60% of sales) rose 12% from the year-ago quarter to $86.3 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $85.3 billion.\r\n\r\nInternational revenues (22% of sales) increased 10% year over year to $31.9 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $32.7 billion.\r\n\r\nAWS revenues (18% of sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion, which surpassed the consensus mark of $24.3 billion.\r\n\r\nStrengthening relationships with third-party sellers remained another positive. In the reported quarter, sales generated by third-party seller services rose 16% on a year-over-year basis to $34.6 billion, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.5 billion.\r\n\r\nSales from robust advertising services increased 24% year over year to $11.8 billion, which marginally lagged the consensus mark of $11.9 billion.\r\n\r\nAMZN experienced year-over-year growth of 6% in its physical store sales, which were $5.2 billion in the reported quarter. The figure topped the consensus mark of $5.1 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company’s online store sales were $54.7 billion, up 7% year over year. The figure marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54.8 billion.\r\n\r\nStrength in Prime was a positive. Amazon witnessed 11% growth in its subscription services sales, which were $10.72 billion in the reported quarter. The figure beat the consensus mark of $10.68 billion.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum with the Same-Day Delivery service worldwide was a positive. Also, the expanding original content and an international slate of content on Prime Video continued to accelerate Prime engagement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Details\n\nOperating expenses were $128.01 billion, up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted 690 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 89.3%.\r\n\r\nThe cost of sales, fulfillment and other operating expenses increased 7.1%, 6.8% and 2.2% year over year to $72.6 billion, $22.3 billion and $228 million, respectively.\r\n\r\nTechnology and infrastructure, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses were $20.4 billion, $9.7 billion and $2.7 billion, down 0.1%, 5% and 9.9% year over year, respectively.\r\n\r\nOverall operating income was $15.3 billion compared with $4.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nOperating income for AWS was $9.4 billion, up 83.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe North America segment reported an operating income of $4.98 billion compared with $898 million in the prior-year quarter. The International segment reported an operating income of $903 million against an operating loss of $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $72.9 billion, down from $73.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nMarketable securities totaled $12.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2024, down from $13.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe long-term debt was $57.6 billion at the end of the reported quarter, down from $58.3 billion at the end of the previous quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter, AMZN generated $18.99 billion of cash from operations, down from $42.5 billion in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, the operating cash flow came in at $99.1 billion. The free cash flow was $50.1 billion.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor second-quarter 2024, Amazon expects net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion. Net sales are expected to grow 7-11% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nManagement projects an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 60 bps.\r\n\r\nOperating income is anticipated between $10 billion and $14 billion.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 9.18% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Amazon has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav is leaning on the company's other sports assets as it remains at risk of losing a key media rights deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\n\"We continue to talk to the NBA,\" Zaslav said while speaking at a Bernstein conference on Thursday. \"We love our experience with the NBA. But in general, we're a leader in sports... [with] a full buffet of content around the world.\"\n\nThe executive touted the company's Olympics coverage win in Europe, along with the recent additions of NHL games, Nascar races and college football in the US.\n\n\"This is what we do for a living,\" he said. \"We're in the business of sport, and in sport, the deals come up [and] you make a decision about the overall quality of the full menu of content you have for each of your platforms.\" DALLAS, TEXAS - MAY 28: Luka Doncic #77 of the Dallas Mavericks handles the ball against the Minnesota Timberwolves during the first quarter in Game Four of the Western Conference Finals at American Airlines Center on May 28, 2024 in Dallas, Texas.

(Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images) (Matthew Stockman via Getty Images)\n\nThe NBA's current contract with Warner Bros.' TNT Network and Disney's ESPN (DIS) expires at the end of next season, and rumors have swirled in recent weeks that WBD could lose the media rights to its portion of games to Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). Amazon (AMZN) is also in talks for an exclusive streaming deal through its Prime Video service.\n\nWall Street analysts have said that possibility would have lasting consequences for the embattled media giant.\n\n\"Losing NBA rights would be a big negative for WBD,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen said in a note published earlier this month. \"While the cost savings may help earnings, we think sports content is key both for linear TV ad sales and carriage fees, and for the Max streaming service's prospects in a competitive direct-to-consumer landscape, especially as it prepares to join the sports streaming [joint venture] with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for legacy media players as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable package or streaming service fee to access sports over many other types of content.\n\nBut the field has become more competitive, with tech giants like Amazon, Apple (AAPL), and YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) committing more heavily to sports streaming deals over the past year. That's inflated the overall costs of sports as traditional media giants struggle to keep up.\n\nWarner Bros. currently shells out a reported $1.2 billion annually for the NBA rights. Disney, the NBA's other major broadcast partner, has agreed to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion in order to renew its deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStory continues\n\nA separate report from the Sports Business Journal suggests Disney's total pay package is closer to $2.8 billion. Amazon's deal is said to be worth between $1.8 billion and $2 billion.\n\nNotably, WBD has the ability to match third-party offers before the NBA enters into any agreements.\n\nLast week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver briefly addressed the negotiations, telling TMZ: \"We’re all still talking. Who knows how it’s going to work out?”\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

He explained that Wall Street is skeptical of Nvidia’s rapid rise, as many need to familiarize themselves with its products.\n\nCramer compared Nvidia’s ascent to Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) dethroning of Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), noting that Nvidia’s fame primarily comes from the enterprise sector and hard-core gamers, CNBC reports.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Expands Partnership with Samsung, New 3nm Chips to Boost Market Share\n\nCramer emphasized that Nvidia’s significance extends beyond gaming. He highlighted Nvidia’s pivotal role in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data centers, which drive its growth.\n\n“Nvidia’s chips are the backbone of AI advancements and have become essential for tech companies and industries worldwide,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer noted, “Nvidia’s potential is immense, and its products are increasingly becoming integral to the tech infrastructure, making it a company that could redefine the future of technology.”\n\nRecent reports indicated Nvidia eying Fan-Out Panel Level Packaging (FOPLP) for GB200 AI server chips as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) battles supply constraints regarding Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) packaging.\n\nAnalysts noted Nvidia as the key AI beneficiary backed by Blackwell chip production pipeline and U.S. Big Tech customers including Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 186% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Amazon gets FAA approval allowing it to expand drone deliveries for online orders",
        "content": "Federal regulators have given Amazon key permission that will allow it to expand its drone delivery program, the company announced Thursday.\n\nIn a blog post posted on its website, Seattle-based Amazon said that the Federal Aviation Administration has given its Prime Air delivery service the OK to operate drones “beyond visual line of sight,” removing a barrier that has prevented its drones from traveling longer distances. With the approval, Amazon pilots can now operate drones remotely without seeing it with their own eyes.\n\nAmazon, which has sought this permission for years, said it received permission from regulators after developing a strategy that ensures its drones could “detect and avoid obstacles in the air.”\n\nFurthermore, the company said it submitted other engineering information to the FAA and conducted flight demonstrations in front of federal inspectors. Those demonstrations were also done “in the presence of real planes, helicopters, and a hot air balloon to demonstrate how the drone safely navigated away from each of them,” Amazon said.\n\nThe FAA’s approval marks a key step for the company, which has had ambitions to deliver online orders through drones for more than a decade. During a TV interview in 2013, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said drones would be flying to customer’s homes within five years. However, the company’s progress was delayed amid regulatory setbacks.\n\nIn 2022, Amazon started performing a limited number of drone deliveries to customers in College Station, Texas and Lockeford, California. Last month, it said it would close its drone delivery site in Lockeford and open another one late this year in Tolleson, Arizona, a city located west of Phoenix.\n\nBusinesses have wanted simpler rules that could open neighborhood’s skies to new commercial applications of drones, but privacy advocates and some airplane and balloon pilots remain wary.\n\nWith the new authorization, Amazon says it will “immediately” scale its operations in College Station in an effort to reach customers in more densely populated areas. By the end of the decade, the company has a goal of delivering 500 million packages by drone every year.\n\nView comments",

The company will expand the area it services with unmanned aerial vehicles in College Station, Texas, and will start integrating such shipments into its same-day delivery network this year.\n\nAmazon is the latest company to gain approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones more freely amid the proliferation of rapid delivery services. UAVs offer a potentially faster, cheaper way to deliver small parcels than paying drivers to fight through traffic and find parking. Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Walmart Inc. have all invested in drones with mixed success.\n\nPrime Air was slow to launch. A Bloomberg investigation in 2022 revealed that the program was beset by technical challenges, high turnover and safety concerns. A serious crash in June 2021 prompted federal regulators to question the drone’s airworthiness because multiple safety features failed and the machine careened out of control, causing a brush fire.\n\nRead More: Amazon Drone Delivery Program Is Hit by Crashes, Safety Concerns\n\nAmazon is seeking to deliver 500 million packages a year by drone by the end of the decade.

        "title": "3 Sorry E-Commerce Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can",
        "content": "For a moment between 2020 and 2022, it seemed as if e-commerce would become the future of how people shop and purchase their daily goods. From companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to CostcoWholesale (NASDAQ:COST), in-person shopping looked like a thing of the past. However, there are still some benefits to shopping in person that e-commerce cannot replace.\n\nMoreover, many of the aforementioned companies’ stocks have seen generous corrections in the period since the pandemic. In some cases, these corrections were more than valid, but in others, they started a trend of uncovering just how low some investors are willing to go.\n\nThis brings us to the question of which e-commerce stocks to sell to minimize long-term portfolio damages. These are three potentially overvalued stocks that could warrant a sell-off for a better position at a later date.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown 20% in the last six months Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has struggled to remain profitable over the last fiscal quarter. Its losses for the first quarter of 2024 hit $273 million, bringing into question its trajectory as an online e-commerce services provider.\n\nFor Shopify to remain relevant in the market with its current business model, it must continuously capture new customers for its service platform, which has been hit-or-miss for its valuation since the pandemic-era online shopping boom.\n\nThese days, the company has focused heavily on its new Shopify Payments platform as a key contributor to its growth. The service, which aims to simplify online payment receipts for Shopify store owners, has improved in penetration but still does not derive additional revenue, due to being a free service.\n\nMoreover, its gross margin decreased by a substantial 50% year-over-year, with operational expenses eating around 45% of revenue. Perhaps these numbers indicate a coming expansion for Shopify, or underscore a difficult business model for operating efficiency. Either way, some analysts agree the stock is overvalued and should be listed among e-commerce stocks to sell.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nA tumultuous history and spin-off divestiture have brought PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to where it is today. While PayPal is not going anywhere and remains deeply embedded as a payment system, it relies heavily on transactions to stay relevant and could be at risk for the short term.\n\nThis makes it one of the better e-commerce stocks to sell for a better re-entry position.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear after year, the company has successfully grown revenue, and though it has gently come down from the pandemic-induced high of the last four years, it may have more room to dip before a rebound. I estimate this is the case because, in part, PayPal relies on non-essential online transactions like shopping and cash exchange. Should the economy take a turn for the worse, people are likely to cut non-essential spending, which could eat away at PayPal’s revenue stream.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo is over an orange background with a little shopping cart with packages in it. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nOn paper, the concept of an online marketplace dedicated to artisans and custom products seems like a great idea. However, in the case of Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), an excessive obsession with growth has pushed the concept to its limits, causing it to stray from its original mission of human commerce.\n\nMuch like other e-commerce platforms, Etsy boomed during the pandemic, as consumers sought comfort through online retail therapy. Luckily, Etsy’s well-positioned model took advantage of this trend, as its perception as a human-driven, handmade marketplace lured in isolated people looking for something more meaningful to buy.\n\nHowever, it seems Etsy could be too big for its shoes as it struggles to balance the needs of its expanding merchant count with the expectations of online consumers. That’s because Etsy always benefitted from its niche as a small platform for small quantity sales, but its duty to shareholders is pushing it away from that benefit.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Battery Makers Burned: 3 EV Stocks to Sell on Lithium Tariff Threat",
        "content": "Earlier in May, President Biden’s administration announced a series of new tariffs on goods sourced from China.\n\nThe move will raise the tariff rate on a variety of imported goods including steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles and batteries, solar industry goods and medical equipment.\n\nThe biggest headline grabbing part of this policy move is the increase in the tariff rate on EVs from 25% to 100%. In theory, if this makes Chinese EVs uneconomic for the American market, that could be a boost for domestic EV producers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut there is another less-discussed part of the policy that could be much worse for EV stocks. Tariff rates on lithium-ion batteries and parts will rise from 7.5% to 25% within the next two years. Meanwhile, the tariff rate on rare critical materials and permanent magnets will rise from 0% to 25%.\n\nGiven that China has overwhelming market share in the battery market and a near monopoly on crucial rare earth materials, this could be a devastating blow for the EV industry. These are three EV stocks to sell as they could face dark days ahead.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla logo displayed on phone with Chinese flag in the background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Koshiro K\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) finds itself right in the middle of the current U.S.-China trade war over electric vehicles. It’s no secret that Elon Musk has bet heavily on China. Tesla spent a fortune to build its Shanghai gigafactory, and production from there has been key to Tesla’s overall growth.\n\nHowever, Tesla now appears to be facing mounting issues there. Tesla just announced a large reduction in its Model Y production in China, given the lingering economic slump and uncertainty there. Tesla’s market share has been sliding in China amid competition from cheaper rivals. Still, Tesla is hoping to sell between 600,000 and 700,000 vehicles in China this year.\n\nTesla finds itself in a tough spot. It is one of the leading advocates for electric vehicles in North America. But it also has heavy sunk costs in China and could lose both sales and access to key inputs such as batteries if the current trade war accelerates.\n\nFor a company that is already dealing with multiple headwinds such as the controversy over Musk’s pay package, this current lithium and EV tariff dispute is another major risk factor for TSLA stock today.\n\nRivian (RIVN) An image of the Rivian logo imposed on top of a stock graph; Rivian stock through magnifying glass\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) started off with great expectations. The EV firm had backing from and exclusive contracts with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) which seemingly put them in a fantastic position to make its mark in the EV industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, a litany of things has gone wrong since then. RIVN stock has dropped from more than $100 per share to just $10 now. Management has seemed unsure whether to fully commit to consumer vehicles or make a major push in the commercial vehicle space. Rivian has also struggled with unit economics, delivering poor gross margins and massive operating losses.\n\nInvestorplace contributor Will Ashworth recently warned that Rivian stock is in trouble even with the current tariff situation. In theory, fewer Chinese EV imports could be a positive for Rivian.\n\nOn the other side though, Rivian is losing money on every vehicle it sells right now. If a prolonged tariff war breaks out for batteries and rare earth materials, Rivian’s already considerable input costs would go even higher.\n\nRivian’s financial situation is already in such murky waters that an eventual bankruptcy filing is not out of the question. Any problems with Rivian’s battery supply chain would add strain to an already difficult situation, making RIVN one of the EV stocks to sell.\n\nVinFast Auto (VFS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of Vietnamese car manufacturer VinFast (VFS) on screen in front of business web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is another EV stock to sell, potentially facing negative consequences from the EV and lithium tariff battle.\n\nBased in Vietnam, VinFast finds itself in an interesting position. It’s not a Chinese EV producer, but it could be effected by the broader tariff battle over EVs. Any further measures that attempt to protect domestic U.S. EV makers could have negative impacts on VinFast.\n\nAnd it’s not like everything is going great for VinFast right now. VFS stock has fallen more than 90% from its all-time high. Furthermore, the company lost more than $1 billion over the past 12 months.\n\nIn addition to its other issues, VinFast also came under fire earlier in May over safety concerns. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that it is investigating VinFast over a fatal crash that occurred on April 24. The crash appears to be tied to potential defects in the steering system of a VinFast VF 8 vehicle.\n\nVinFast is already dealing with multiple significant operational issues right now. Any negative impact from tariffs would further complicate a tricky situation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon Raises Stake in Grubhub, Embeds Food Delivery in App",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is increasing its stake in Grubhub to as much as 18% and expanding its partnership with the food delivery service to allow US users to order takeout directly on Amazon’s website and shopping app.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid American Air Fired Commercial Head After Sales Strategy Alienated Corporate Clients\n\nAmazon already had a 4% stake in Grubhub, up from 2% when it announced its earlier deal with Grubhub in 2022. Under the new five-year agreement, Amazon will receive options for an additional 3% stake in Grubhub and another 1% a year from now, Grubhub’s Dutch parent Just Eat Takeaway.com NV said in a statement on Thursday. It will have the opportunity to increase the holding to 18%, depending on the performance of the partnership and the number of orders.\n\nJust Eat Takeaway’s shares rose 2.4% to €12.2 at 12:26 p.m. in Amsterdam trading on Thursday after earlier gaining as much as 5%.\n\n“This will enable us to engage with the tens of millions of Prime members and introduce them to Grubhub,” said Grubhub Chief Executive Officer Howard Migdal in an interview. “We expect this to be a large catalyst for new customer growth for Grubhub.”\n\nAs part of the deal, Amazon Prime shoppers will also receive a free Grubhub+ membership.\n\nAmazon has made a habit of acquiring stakes in its major business partners, often through warrants, an effort to realize more of the financial windfall of the tie-up. The retail and cloud-computing giant has in recent years scooped up stakes in the airlines that fly Amazon cargo aircraft, an electric vehicle maker, a grocery distributor and software companies, among other firms.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\n“Just Eat Takeaway’s five-year pact with Amazon incorporates Grubhub (GH) into Prime in what may be a longer-term solution to reverse US user losses. But the new agreement, more than the current tie-in, also replaces GH’s own-subscription revenue potential and makes a sale of the company to another party less likely. Just Eat, which saw US profit losses ease in 2023, is effectively providing a white-label food-delivery service for Prime members.”\n\n— Diana Gomes, BI Senior Industry Analyst\n\nClick here for the research\n\nFor Just Eat, the partnership could help temper the double-digit declines it’s seen in orders and gross transaction value in the North American market. Meanwhile, the firm has been contending with weak demand for food deliveries in Europe, its home region.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust Eat executives said in April that the company was still exploring the partial or full sale of US-based Grubhub, which it acquired for $7.3 billion in 2021. Just Eat announced plans to divest in April 2022 but attributed delays to high price demands from some investors and a weak market for deals.\n\nCompetition between food-delivery firms in the US has also been intense. Grubhub’s market share in the US has been on a steady decline since 2021, reaching around 8% in March, according to Bloomberg Second Measure data. It trails behind DoorDash Inc., which holds a 67% lead, and Uber Technologies Inc., which has 23%.\n\nThe embedding of Grubhub within the Amazon app will also help raise awareness of the ongoing Grubhub+ promotion. A Grubhub membership otherwise costs $120 a year in exchange for lower service charges and waived delivery fees on select orders.\n\n“Customers we’ve gotten from Amazon, who’ve linked their Prime accounts, order more frequently than our average customers,” Migdal said. “They’re a really good cohort of customers,” he added, saying the partnership has also helped Amazon retain Prime subscribers.\n\nAmazon started offering members of its Prime program free delivery from Grubhub in 2022, a benefit it portrayed as a temporary perk. The offer was extended a year later. Now, Amazon says it plans to offer members — who pay $139 a year in the US — free delivery through Grubhub on an ongoing basis. The company says it has more than 200 million Prime members globally.\n\nAmazon in recent years has rolled back some Prime perks, including raising the free-delivery minimum for Amazon’s own grocery delivery services. Viewers of previously ad-free Prime Video now see streaming ads. At the same time, the company has added Grubhub memberships, along with programs for discounted drugs and medical care, to get shoppers to keep paying for a service that began as a speedy shipping program.\n\nInstacart earlier this month announced a similar plan to embed Uber Eats’ ordering interface within the Instacart app. Unlike that partnership, however, Grubhub is not required to pay Amazon a referral fee or additional costs per order.\n\nGrubhub’s announcement may also be a boon for its nearly 200,000 delivery drivers in the US as restaurants get more orders from Amazon users and possibly more visibility. “We do have waiting lists in many cities for more couriers so we’re hopeful this will turn into more earning opportunities for couriers, as well,” Migdal said.\n\n--With assistance from Cagan Koc.\n\n(Updates with Just Eat Takeaway share reaction in third paragraph and analyst quote)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Yes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year New York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo's Race to Boost Supplies Israel’s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another ‘Lost Decade’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Great Oral Health has been selling dental products on Amazon.com Inc. for almost a decade, buying ads from the e-commerce giant to help it stand out on the sprawling marketplace. But lately, the company noticed that spending more on Amazon ads was doing little to drum up new business.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid American Air Fired Commercial Head After Sales Strategy Alienated Corporate Clients\n\nSo it turned to another well-known advertising company: Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nShoppers find Great Oral Health’s ads on Google when researching solutions for bad breath, gum disease and other maladies. The results direct them to the company’s oral probiotic on Amazon, which actually pays merchants to lure customers from other sites because it would rather keep the business than lose it to Walmart.com or another competitor.\n\nAmazon merchants have long used Google to drive shoppers to their own websites, with mixed results. Now new third-party software is helping them direct Google searchers to Amazon where they’re comfortable shopping. Sellers say the technique is boosting sales and improving their profits because Google ads are typically cheaper than Amazon’s. The credit Amazon pays for external traffic – typically 10% of the product price — sweetens the deal.\n\n“Amazon knows Google is a monster and all shoppers are walking in those corridors,” said Ryan Duminy, a consultant with Bullseye Sellers who manages advertising for Great Oral Health.\n\nAmazon has been selling ads for more than a decade, despite initial fears that doing so could muck up the shopping experience. Today, the Seattle-based company is a major industry player, generating $47 billion in advertising revenue last year. But it has become increasingly difficult to stand out on Amazon’s cluttered web store, prompting sellers and brands to search for marketing alternatives.\n\nGoogle, which has long struggled to become a shopping destination, is only too happy to help. In an effort to attract inflation-stung consumers, the search giant rolled out a deal-finding tool in the fall. Earlier this month, Google said it is beta-testing new features that let brands upload short videos to appear in their Google search results.\n\nBut what really changed the game for Amazon sellers is the emergence of startups like Toronto-based Carbon6 and Seattle-based Ampd, which developed algorithms adept at mining Google queries for shoppers itching to buy. Searchers can be targeted by age, marital status and income, metrics that can be used to calculate the likelihood of them making a purchase. The software also filters out information seekers, who may not be ready to pull the trigger.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The really big breakthrough is targeting likely buyers on Google and sending them to Amazon,” said Tim Jordan, chief community officer at Carbon6, whose PixelMe software helps companies hone their Google marketing campaigns. “If you send a lot of traffic from Google to Amazon and those people aren’t buying, that’s bad traffic. You don’t make any money.”\n\nMore than 70% of all purchases made on Amazon by shoppers directed there from Google advertisements are making their first purchase from that brand, making it a valuable pipeline for new customers, according to a report from Jungle Scout. More than one-third of Amazon sellers said increasing traffic to their products on Amazon from external sites such as Google is a priority this year, the report said.\n\nAmazon, in an emailed statement, said it helps sellers reach consumers through a variety of advertising initiatives, which all continue to grow. “One of these choices is the Brand Referral Bonus program, which helps brands improve the efficiency of their non-Amazon marketing campaigns.” Ampd, which says on its website that its software has directed 12 million Google users to Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nThe software tools tend to make the most financial sense for mid- to high-priced items, since keyword costs aren’t tied closely to a product’s price. If a merchant selling a $50 item on Amazon buys the Google search term for $5 or less, it’s essentially a free ad buy since Amazon credits them $5 for the traffic referral.\n\nOnline sellers are also responding to a decisive shift in consumer behavior. As recently as 2022, almost 52% of US shopping journeys began on online marketplaces such as Amazon.com, according to an annual survey by EMarketer. Last year, only 40% of shopping trips started there. Almost 30% of shoppers began their shopping on search engines like Google, up from 25% in the previous year.\n\nEMarketer analyst Sky Canaves says deal-hunting shoppers are site-hopping rather than limiting themselves to one marketplace. The proliferation of advertising on Amazon also makes it harder for them to find what they want, she said. “Consumers are looking to save and stretch their dollars wherever possible,” Canaves said. “They may find it easier to compare prices and find deals across retailers via search versus on marketplaces.”\n\nWith more shoppers using search engines to find products, it makes sense for Amazon sellers to advertise there.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo's Race to Boost Supplies New York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be the 5 Largest Trillion-Dollar Stocks by 2035 (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "If there's one constant on Wall Street every investor should be aware of, it's change. History shows that, over time, Wall Street's biggest companies by market cap are constantly being reshuffled.\n\nIn 2000, brand-name businesses like Nokia, Intel, and General Electric were among the top 10 publicly traded companies by market cap. Today, just one of these top-10 companies from 2000 is still among the largest in the world (I'll get to this company a bit later).\n\nNo one has a crystal ball that can, with 100% accuracy, predict the future on Wall Street. But that doesn't stop investors from making educated guesses about the future, which is what I'm about to do now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThough technological innovations, mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs, and economic events can be extremely difficult to predict when looking years into the future, I believe the following five stocks will be the largest trillion-dollar companies by 2035 -- and artificial intelligence (AI) titan Nvidia, which may be in a mammoth bubble, won't be one of them!\n\n1. Amazon\n\nBy 2035, my expectation is that e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will comfortably be the largest publicly traded company in the U.S.\n\nThe fuel that should help Amazon capture the crown as Wall Street's top dog by market cap is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages of ramping, yet AWS already has $100 billion in annual run-rate sales and has captured a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend, as of the end of 2023, per Canalys. Cloud-service margins blow online retail sales margins out of the water. As AWS ramps, Amazon's operating cash flow can grow at a substantially faster pace than its total sales.\n\nAmazon's subscription services and advertising services segments should hold their own, too. The company surpassed 200 million Prime subscribers three years ago and has since added the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football and expanded its content library. The exceptional pricing power associated with Prime should meaningfully boost sales and cash flow from this segment.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon draws in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion people to its site each month, which equates to strong ad-pricing power.\n\nI fully expect Amazon's cash flow to send its valuation to north of $5 trillion over the next 11 years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nRemember the lone stock I alluded to earlier that's the only remnant from the 10 largest companies by market cap in 2000? It's software giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). I expect this cash cow of a company to retain its place in the top five over the coming decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's not-so-subtle secret to success has been its uncanny ability to blend the old with the new. For example, Windows may not be growth segment it was 25 years ago, but it remains the undisputed top global operating system by market share. Microsoft continues to generate boatloads of cash flow from legacy segments like Windows and Office and utilizes this cash to reinvest in higher-growth initiatives and acquisitions.\n\nNothing has been more important this decade to Microsoft than its cloud-service ties. Azure is the No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform behind AWS, with constant-currency sales growth pacing around 30% in recent quarters. The enterprise integration of cloud-related services among its multiple suites of products can sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft is swimming in cash. It closed out March with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated a jaw-dropping $110 billon in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. Microsoft has more than enough capital coming in to take chances on acquisitions and game-changing innovations.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nThe third-largest trillion-dollar stock by 2035, based on my prognostication, will be Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and global No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud.\n\nTime is certainly something that's going to work in Alphabet's favor. For the last nine years, Google has accounted for no less than 90% of global monthly internet search share. With Google unlikely to cede its monopoly like share of search, this should allow Alphabet's ad-driven operations to benefit from lengthy periods of economic expansion. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, there hasn't been one that's lasted longer than 18 months since the end of World War II.\n\nLike Amazon and Microsoft, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud is going to play a key role in Alphabet's success. Google Cloud finished up its first profitable year in 2023 and should have no trouble scaling its sales, profits, and operating margin in the years to come as businesses increase their cloud-based information technology spending.\n\nAlphabet also boasts a healthy balance sheet, with nearly $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as of March 31. It can make acquisitions or organically invest in game-changing projects without adversely impacting its bottom line or foundational operating segments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nThe company ranked fourth on my list of trillion-dollar stocks by 2035 is social media colossus Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta is the parent company behind the following ultra-popular social sites: Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Mesenger, and Threads.\n\nSimilar to Alphabet, Meta should be one of the prime beneficiaries of sustained periods of economic growth for the U.S. and global economy. Meta generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, and businesses tend to be looser with their marketing budgets when the U.S. and global economy are firing on all cylinders. With Meta's social media \"real estate\" attracting 3.24 billion daily active users in the March-ended quarter, advertisers understand they're not going to reach more eyeballs on any other platform.\n\nMeta Platforms can also benefit from its longtail growth opportunity in virtual/augmented reality, the metaverse, and AI. While Meta's Reality Labs segment is expected to be a money drain for the next couple of years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a knack for building up platforms and opening the flood gates for monetization when they're good and ready (and not before).\n\nTo somewhat keep with the theme, Meta Platforms' balance sheet gives it the luxury of making these investments in its future. Meta closed out March with $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and is pacing $77 billion in net cash generated from its operations on an annual run-rate basis.\n\n5. Visa\n\nThe fifth largest trillion-dollar stock by 2035 won't be Nvidia, which I expect will be the victim of an AI bubble-bursting event, or Apple, whose growth engine has completely stalled over the last two years. Rather, it'll be the world's leading payment processor, Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nJust as ad-driven platforms Alphabet and Meta benefit from lengthy periods of economic growth, Visa enjoys the fruits of higher enterprise and consumer spending. Since World War II ended, most economic expansions have endured multiple years, with two periods of growth surpassing the decade mark. Payment processors absolutely thrive during these expansions.\n\nWhat gives Visa a pathway to become one of the five-largest publicly traded companies by 2035 is its addressable opportunity. In addition to being the clear-cut No. 1 in market share by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the top global market for consumption), Visa has a multidecade runway in numerous emerging markets where consumers and businesses remain largely underbanked (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia). Cross-border volume has consistently grown by double-digits, which speaks to this still untapped international opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, Visa's management team has avoided the temptation of becoming a lender. Strictly focusing on payment facilitation has allowed Visa to sidestep the credit delinquencies and loan losses that arise during economic downturns and derail lending institutions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of7 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.\n\nSince Amazon is part of Loeb's top large-cap stock picks, the stock deserves a detailed look. But first let's see the latest performance of the billionaire.\n\nActivist investor and billionaire Dan Loeb made a comeback in the final quarter of 2023 after losing money during most of the year in addition to suffering losses in 2022. Wall Street Journal earlier this year reported that Loeb’s Third Point, which he founded in 1995, gained between 7.8% to 8.6% in the December quarter. Third Point was also down 21% in 2022. Third Point was a star performer in the pandemic year as the fund closed 2020 up 19%, as Loeb foresaw the economy doing much better than many had expected.\n\nLoeb's Q1'2024 Returns and Performance\n\nLoeb is known for his activist bets in high-profile companies Intel, Disney and Shell. Some of his bets were highly unsuccessful, while others paid off. Latest data shows Loeb is continuing to retain the Q4'2023 momentum into 2024. In his Q1 letter to investors, Loeb revealed that Third Point returned 7.8% in the flagship Offshore Fund.\n\nBillionaire Loeb Joins the \"Soft Landing Camp\"\n\nLoeb said in his Q1 letter that he's in the \"soft landing camp\" as he believes we are no longer in an inflationary environment. He's also highly bullish on AI, saying the technology favors the \"incumbents\" who are deploying massive cash \"war chests\" to win the \"AI arms race,\" a term the billionaire used twice in his letter. Loeb is betting on the whole AI spectrum — semiconductors, data centers, AI software and power.\n\n\"We shared our views on AI’s transformational potential in recent letters and it is a key element of the thesis for nearly half of our equity positions today. Unlike in past periods of technological paradigm shifts, this new technology favors incumbents who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race. Right now, what we see as the best-run “legacy” companies like Microsoft and Amazon (both of which we own) have built enormous competitive advantages and seen their growth vectors accelerate. Below, we discuss London Stock Exchange Group, Alphabet and TSMC, positions whose catalysts for further value creation are primarily “AI-driven”. We also see the energy transition and growth in data centers affecting scores of industrial, materials and energy companies as demand for infrastructure and certain commodities surges.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFor this article we scanned Third Point’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top large-cap stock holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire Dan Loeb Q1'2024 Stake Value: $919,938,000\n\nBillionaire Dan Loeb increased his position in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) by 22% during the first quarter, ending the period with a $920 million stake. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nHowever, Amazon skeptics believe the stock has run too much as its valuation is high. For value-conscious investors the market is indeed teeming with other opportunities. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced MSFT to take the spot of the most popular stock among the over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. A total of 302 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in Insider Monkey’s list of the7 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is beefing up its food delivery perk through its Prime service, expanding a business partnership with Grubhub and bolstering its offerings as merchants and retailers increasingly compete for subscription revenue and bundled services.\n\nPrime members will now get free access to Grubhub+, a $120-a-year subscription service that includes free deliveries on eligible orders and lower service fees. Amazon customers and Prime members can also start ordering from Grubhub directly on Amazon's website and app, the company announced late Wednesday.\n\nThe Grubhub benefit bolsters Amazon's food offerings, which operate on multiple prongs. They include Amazon’s traditional network, delivering nonperishable foods; grocery delivery through Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods, and other retailers; and, with Grubhub, takeout. During Amazon's latest earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said both the nonperishable and grocery businesses were growing. Amazon touts more than 300 million items available with free Prime shipping. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Amazon already offers a lot of value, but it needs to keep pushing the envelope as more retailers develop their own loyalty and membership programs,\" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData. \"It is also a way of making Amazon a one-stop shop for food needs.\"\n\nThe Grubhub perk, which solidifies and expands on a previous trial offer, underscores Amazon's efforts to shape Prime into an all-encompassing membership program.\n\n\"Prime is all about convenience, savings, entertainment, increasingly health, and with Grubhub, we are deepening the partnership to really stand for food delivery as well, and really round out, in one simple membership, all the needs and wants of busy households across the United States.\" Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\n\nGhani declined to comment on the possibility of Amazon acquiring Grubhub. The original partnership announcement between Amazon and Grubhub in 2022 included the option for Amazon to exercise warrants for a 2% stake in Grubhub, as well as additional warrants exercisable for up to another 13%.\n\n\"I don’t think a takeover is on the cards right now, although it may be of interest in the future,\" Saunders said. \"Amazon is currently in the mindset of driving efficiencies across the business rather than doing big deals. Amazon would also need to be convinced that it could add value to Grubhub or parent company Just Eat in order to do a deal.\"\n\nGhani said the company sees the Grubhub deal as part of Prime's progression in value. What started in 2005 as an untested free shipping service has grown into an e-commerce juggernaut. Membership benefits have expanded to streaming and music, medical services, Thursday Night Football, and takeout.\n\nStory continues\n\nPreviously, Amazon gave Prime members a one-year Grubhub+ trial that converted to a paid membership. In the new arrangement, Prime members only need to activate the ongoing Grubhub+ offer to receive the free, ongoing benefit.\n\nFor Grubhub, which is owned by Just Eat Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), Saunders said the partnership is a way to expand memberships, which helps it earn more commissions from restaurants.\n\nShares of Just Eat are down almost 14% for the year, lagging competitors DoorDash (DASH) and Uber (UBER), whose stock prices are up 16% and 11%, respectively. While customers flocked to food delivery businesses during the height of the pandemic, the business model continues to face questions about sustainable profitability.\n\nAmazon shares have gained more than 20% for the year, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite's (^IXIC) 15% rise.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Starting today, Amazon customers in the U.S. can order from hundreds of thousands of restaurants in all 50 states with Grubhub directly on Amazon.com and in the Amazon Shopping app. Additionally, as long as a customer remains a Prime member, they can enjoy a free ongoing Grubhub+ membership worth $120 a year, without automatically renewing into a paid Grubhub+ membership. Grubhub+ includes $0 delivery fees on eligible orders over $12, lower service fees, 5% credit back on pick-up orders, and exclusive offers.\n\n\"Whether it's saving money on your favorite takeout with Grubhub+, exclusive deals on Prime Day, prescription savings with RxPass, entertainment with Prime Video, or free shipping on more than 300 million items including tens of millions of products available with Same-Day or One-Day Delivery, Prime keeps getting better for members,\" said Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. \"We know Prime members value savings on food delivery, so we are extending the $0 delivery fees and exclusive savings with Grubhub+ for Prime members, and now customers can enjoy easy access to Grubhub from the Amazon store and app.\"\n\n\"We’re thrilled to build on our successful collaboration with Amazon and bring more convenience to Amazon customers by offering Grubhub’s network of hundreds of thousands of restaurants directly on Amazon.com and in the Amazon Shopping app,\" said Howard Migdal, chief executive officer of Grubhub. \"More consumers can now experience the exceptional value and service offered by Grubhub+, with Prime members enjoying $0 delivery fees on an ongoing basis.\"\n\nGet Your Grub (and Convenience) On\n\nAmazon customers can now access Grubhub conveniently on Amazon.com and in the Amazon Shopping app, enabling Grubhub orders without having to download or switch to the Grubhub app. Visit amazon.com/grubhub to complete a food delivery order with Grubhub.

Previously offered as a one-year trial that converted to a paid Grubhub+ membership, Prime members only need to activate the ongoing Grubhub+ offer once—all one needs to enjoy Grubhub+ is a Prime membership.\n\nSince the start of the Grubhub+ offer in 2022, Prime members have saved hundreds of millions of dollars from waived subscription fees and discounts. Those who place at least one order a month save an average of $300 per year in delivery fees and promotions with Grubhub+. Beyond the $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, lower service fees, 5% credit back on pick-up orders, and exclusive offers that come with Grubhub+, Prime members automatically save $120 per year on a Grubhub+ membership—and every year thereafter as long as they remain with Prime.\n\nAdditionally, Prime members can whet their appetites with an exclusive promotional offer, saving Prime members $5 on a Grubhub delivery order over $25 from now through June 2 with the code \"PRIME5\". The code can be entered by Prime members during checkout when shopping Grubhub on Amazon.com or in the Amazon Shopping app, or the code can be automatically applied by clicking on a banner at checkout. Those Prime members who choose to use the Grubhub app can input the code manually. Terms and conditions apply.\n\nAdditional Amazon & Grubhub Experiences and Offers\n\nGrubhub and Amazon aren’t only rewarding Prime members through cost savings and convenience, but also through exclusive experiences. With Prime Video and Grubhub's ongoing \"Tune In & Takeout\" series, the age-old dilemma of \"what to watch and what to eat\" is solved with unique food pairings and offers that connect to members’ favorite shows and movies on Prime Video, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Road House, and Ricky Stanicky. Grubhub recently delivered a limited edition Nuka-Blast Burger meal for fans to celebrate the premiere of Fallout on Prime Video. The kit came with the infamously spicy Nuka-Blast Burger, along with other iconic staples from the show’s post-apocalyptic universe, delivered in a one-of-a-kind collector’s box.\n\nExplore the Benefits of Prime\n\nPrime is savings, convenience, and entertainment all in a single membership.

        "title": "Five Broad Technology ETFs To Keep On Your Radar In 2024",
        "content": "Major U.S. indices are coming off a strong performance quarter following surging gains of large-cap technology stocks fueling the bull market. Despite the slight drawback in recent weeks, Wall Street analysts are positive that there’s still enough steam left in the engines before indices could experience a retraction.\n\nTech Holding Steady\n\nOn Monday, May 20 indices across the market were pursuing new records as the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.65%, reaching an intra-day record high of 16,794.87. The broader S&P 500 furthered its winning streak, gaining 0.09% and ending the trading day at 5,309.13.\n\nOn Wall Street, all eyes were on the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had caught investors off guard following its breakout performance on Friday, May 17. The Dow ended the trading day above 40,000, a new record for the 30-stock index and the first time in its nearly 128-year history.\n\nAfter the weekend, however, the Dow Jones slightly retreated, falling 196.82 points on May 20, and closing off at 39,806.77.\n\nThough retraction levels are somewhat superficial at this time, investors are hot on the heels of large-cap technology stocks and companies that are expected to begin delivering earnings results in the following weeks.\n\nThe next couple of weeks are set to be yet another eventful time on the stock market as major players such as AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are expected to deliver earnings. Company stocks gained 2% on May 20, as investors and analysts raised their pricing positions ahead of its earnings report.\n\nNvidia continues to push beyond the glass ceiling, with stocks up more than 96% since the turn of the year and already gaining more than 206% in the last 12 months. The tech and chip titan is now the third-largest on the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion.\n\nThough elsewhere, broader economic performance continues to remain volatile despite U.S. inflation trending downwards and domestic demand for products and services cools. Inflation data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in April with CPI rising 3.4% year on year, Reuters reported.\n\nSticky inflation and wage growth have left the Federal Reserve’s decision unchanged about cutting interest rates any time soon, with the federal fund rate still sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%. A potential rate cut is expected near the end of summer, as the central bank continues to gauge inflation, employment, and wage growth as key decision-makers before losing their monetary policy. 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nNew York Wall Street sign.\n\nLooking Towards Diversifying\n\nThe overactive market conditions are bringing new and old investors to consider other possibilities that could provide them with broader diversification in the tech sector. As the competition among large-cap companies continues to swell, those looking to hold a safer position could instead be looking at tech exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an opportunity to gain market share and further diversify their holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroad tech ETFs are a corner of the market that has received major attention in recent years, with holdings in companies that are directly involved in the technology industry, including networking, software, hardware, semiconductors, social media, search engine marketing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nHere’s a breakdown of five broad tech ETFs to keep on your radar this year.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF\n\n5G connectivity is taking off at full speed despite being only in the beginning stages of its lifecycle. An Ericsson Mobility Report found that more than 1.6 billion 5G smartphone subscriptions were active by the end of 2023 with a projected two billion to be active by the end of this year.\n\nThe exceptional growth of the market has meant that mobile service providers are quickly catching wind of these developments and looking to leverage larger market opportunities in the coming years.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG) shows that 5G technology and connectivity aren’t only essential for everyday communication but instead provide a stable investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their portfolios into this seemingly untapped market.\n\nThe fund has roughly 53 holdings, offering investors transparent exposure to 5G stocks and companies engaged in connectivity services, development, research, and commercialization. The underlying index tracks 48 globally-listed stocks with various market capitalizations.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, the fund has held steady, offering a 21.68% one-year return, and roughly 9.15% since inception. Total return (NAV) is slightly in line with broader market performance, with year-to-date returns of 2.77%, as of May 2024.\n\nA diverse fund holding ensures that investors obtain the necessary exposure to large-cap technology and network stocks, with iPhone maker, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) having the top spot, with 5.67% of the fund invested in Apple shares.\n\nOther notable holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO).\n\nThe Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF is more than a fund directed at network mobility. Instead, Defiance claims that this fund allows investors to gain traction in a rapidly growing industry that’s connected to more than mobile devices, but instead sees some of its biggest customers being in healthcare, finance, and data generation.\n\niShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM) is a broad technology fund with roughly 278 holdings in North American equities. The objective of the fund is to provide investors with more diversified exposure to North American equities and companies operating in the technology sector, including communication services and the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nOn top of this, the fund manages several holdings related to hardware, software, internet marketing, and interactive media. Overall, the Expanded Tech Sector ETF aims to provide North American and international investors with an expressed view of advanced technology companies and the broader tech sector.\n\nBased on current performance data, the iShares Extended Tech Sector ETF has gained roughly 10.59 since its inception back in 2001. One year total return is currently standing at 52.97%, which for some investors might seem outlandish considering the fund's broad exposure to various capital sectors.\n\nThe staggering performance of the fund can be largely attributed to its ability to invest in a large quantity of diverse tech and software companies. At the top of the list, companies such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) make up the largest portion of fund distributions.\n\nOutside of investing in major tech companies, most of which are part of the Magnificent Seven, the fund has much of its distributions held up in the semiconductor and interactive media services, investing 24.0% and 19.31% of the fund, respectively. Other sectors of importance include application and system software, and lesser-known services such as IT consulting and communication equipment.\n\nSince the turn of the year, the fund has gained 17.73%, while the broader S&P 500 has risen 11.29% YTD, and the S&P 500 Information Technology index is up by 16.24% YTD.\n\nRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\n\nAnother suitable option for investors looking to invest in large-cap high-tech companies is the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) which invests in the top 7 tech stocks and provides investors with more exposure to heavy-weight competitors.\n\nFor investors that are not yet aware, the Magnificent Seven is the collective name given to the largest, and most prominent tech companies and includes Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nIn the last couple of years, these seven trailblazing companies have helped push technology stocks to new heights, and the widespread development of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fuel the next generation of tech and software developers.\n\nMAGS offers investors pure exposure to the Magnificent Seven companies, reducing direct volatile risk exposure and weighting out portfolio distribution. On average, distribution holdings are fairly equal, although currently 16.36% is invested in Alphabet Class A shares, with Meta Platforms taking the bottom position with 12.61% fund allocation.\n\nThough the fund offers direct pure exposure to mega-cap tech stocks, seasoned professionals might be skeptical about the long-term viability of MAGS. For starters, the fund is relatively new, coming onto the market in November 2023, meaning that many investors still have limited amounts of data to clearly define their forward-looking position of the fund.\n\nSecondly, the fund solely holds seven stocks, meaning that risk distribution to return potential is seemingly higher, and can be considered a drawback for older, more seasoned investors that are looking to lower these risks and direct capital towards more buoyant long-term options.\n\nFinally, a principal investment strategy of MAGS is to invest at least 80% of its assets, including borrowings for investment purposes in the financial instruments of its holdings that provide the best exposure, or a combination of economic characteristics.\n\nThis could mean that should one of its holdings, or several others experience a significant decline in revenue, profit, market share, or market capitalization, the fund could then possibly experience declined near-term returns.\n\nThough it’s an ambitious technology fund that gives the best possible exposure to the Magnificent Seven, perhaps investors who are looking to reduce risks and mitigate near-term volatility would be best suited to opt for something more geared towards their forward-looking goals.\n\nVanEck Robotics ETF\n\nOn paper, the VanECK Robotics ETF (IBOT) offers a multi-dynamic investment opportunity that sees the fund invest in large-scale technological projects and developments supported by global market demand.\n\nIBOT exposure is directed toward high-growth companies, the majority focusing on future industrial automation and technological acceleration. Based on current data, IBOT invests the majority of its capital in the information technology sector, followed by industrial and consumer discretionary. Other, smaller holdings are focused on healthcare, energy, and cash.\n\nThe fund aims to replicate the performance of the BlueState Robotics Index which tracks companies that are closely involved in the field of robotics research and development.\n\nOverall, the BlueStar Robotics Index has held steady performance, with the index rising 23.45% over the past 12 months. The BlueStar Robotics Index has distributions across the world, investing in highly developed and high-growth capital markets, including the U.S., Japan, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, among other countries.\n\nSince its inception back in April 2023, the VanEck robotics fund has gained roughly 21.39%, slightly below the 22.16% return reported by the BlueStar Robotics Index during the same period. However, a yearly return is currently reported at 22.17%, which could give a positive indication for investors looking to actively leverage the robotics industry.\n\nIn a report by the International Federation of Robotics, recent data showed that in 2023, manufacturing companies across the world, and primarily in the U.S. have heavily invested in production line and supply chain automation. During the period, robotic installations rose by 12%, reaching more than 44,300 units in 2023, with the automotive industry being the top adopter of automation and robotic equipment.\n\nOn the back of surging growth and demand, IBOT could be the link investors need to tap into the marketing of automation and robotic equipment. With both the private and public sectors now plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into the world of robotics automation, IBOT could perhaps be the turning point for novice and seasoned investors.\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nLast on the list is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) which aims to track the performance of a benchmark index through passively managed strategies, including a full-replication strategy when possible.\n\nAs the name suggests, VGT is focused on investment movement within the information technology sector with 27.60% of its weighted exposure allocated to the semiconductor sector. The systems software sector follows second, making up 22.90% of the fund, and technology hardware, storage, and peripherals take up 17.30%.\n\nAlthough these are only three of the primary sectors the fund is invested in, holdings such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Cisco Systems, and Accenture (NYSE: ACN) are among the 313 other companies that make up the broader diversification of VGT.\n\nFor the physical year-end 31 August 2023, Vanguard Information Technology ETF reported a strong turnover rate of 15.4%, while the fund currently has an earnings growth rate of 2.07%, according to recent fund information.\n\nOther performance data indicates that VGT managed to slightly outperform the benchmark one-year performance rate. VGT reported a 12-month return of 29.70%, while the benchmark return was 29.66%.\n\nFor investors who are seeking more weighted security and direct exposure to the domestic information technology sector, VGT is considered a reasonably safer option for long-term opportunities and provides a seemingly secure holdings distribution.\n\nRiding Out Uncertainty\n\nAs the bull run is expected to extend well into the coming months, looking toward the technology sector for better portfolio and performance buoyancy is becoming a sure strategic decision for investors and Wall Street investment firms.\n\nAlthough uncertainty continues to loom overhead, with geopolitical tension and tight interest rates keeping some investors at bay, those seeking to leverage current market conditions are holding steady on technology stocks and ETFs due to a positive turnaround in the market.\n\nArguably, conditions are looking surprisingly positive for both ends of the spectrum. The S&P 500 Information Technology index is above the broader S&P 500, gaining 16.24% compared to 11.29% year to date. On a quarterly basis, similar conditions are playing out, as the S&P tech sector index gained 3.34% compared to 1.02% on the S&P.\n\nMarket conditions are piping hot, and investors aren’t taking a backseat anytime soon. Yet, broader economic conditions and the possibility of a hard landing remain deciding factors for some seasoned investors who are hoping to ride out near-term volatility.\n\nFinishing Thoughts\n\nTechnology is rapidly changing the way we work and communicate, and the companies spearheading the race to innovation are casting a bright light on new opportunities on the stock market.\n\nThough there is still a lot of uncertainty up ahead, both in relation to macroeconomic conditions and the global political environment, investors should consider seeking out investments, and diverse funds that not only provide stability but offer them the necessary long and near-term broad exposure in advanced tech sectors that can ride out uncertainty,m while providing sufficient portfolio buoyancy.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: I recently initiated a small position in Tesla, no other positions in any other positions mentioned.\n\nRelated Content\n\n10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now Should You Hold Nvidia (NVDA)?

        "title": "Chewy Stock (NYSE:CHWY): Hot Pick for the Dog Days of Summer",
        "content": "Can you feel the heat? The so-called dog days of summer are upon us, and enterprising investors should be on the lookout for buy-low, sell-high opportunities. Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) might not be the most obvious choice, but there’s definitely something going on as Chewy shares are suddenly trading with high volume. After digging into the data on Chewy and seeing what all of the fuss is about, I am now unabashedly bullish on CHWY stock.\n\nChewy sells a variety of pet supplies online, including food, collars and leashes, toys, and even medicine. This business model might raise scary memories of Pets.com stock, which was emblematic of the dot-com bubble and crash of the early 2000s.\n\nDon’t worry about Chewy ending up like Pets.com, though. A fresh quarterly report reveals that Chewy is not only a profitable business venture, but the company is doing better than some of the experts on Wall Street had anticipated. In addition, Chewy is now doing something that many successful businesses do – but we’ll get to that in a moment.\n\nA Big Rip after a Long, Painful Dip\n\nChewy was a darling among stock traders during the boom period of 2020’s second half and early 2021. That’s because, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people opted to purchase their pet supplies online.\n\nHowever, Chewy doesn’t benefit from the pandemic catalyst anymore in 2024. CHWY stock is currently far below its peak price of more than $100, and some skeptics might wonder whether it will ever recover.\n\nYet, the tide of sentiment can change direction in just a single day. Today, Chewy stock is up 25.8% midday, and the trading volume is practically off the charts. Could this be the start of another run to $100?\n\nLet’s not get ahead of ourselves. Before you put a dog in the race with a share position, you’ll definitely want to find out why Chewy, of all companies, is suddenly trending.\n\nIt all has to do with Chewy’s financial results for Fiscal Year 2024’s first quarter. Chewy CEO Sumit Singh declared, “Fiscal year 2024 is off to a solid start.” That’s all fine and well, but were Chewy’s results really “solid,” and why are stock traders suddenly bidding up CHWY stock?\n\nChewy Delights Investors with a Buyback Program\n\nBesides paying dividends (which, I’ll admit, Chewy doesn’t currently do), how can companies demonstrate respect to their shareholders? One answer is that they can buy back their own shares, and that’s exactly what Chewy will do.\n\nTo be more specific, Chewy’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million of the company’s Class A and/or Class B common stock. Typically, only confident businesses engage in this practice. After all, a company doesn’t normally buy its own shares if it expects the price to go down.\n\nStory continues\n\nI suspect that Chewy’s share buyback program announcement prompted today’s sharp rally just as much as the company’s quarterly results did. Yet, we shouldn’t overlook Chewy’s “solid” (to borrow the CEO’s adjective) Q1-FY2024 financial performance.\n\nA notable highlight of the quarter was Chewy’s Autoship sales, which increased by 6.4% year-over-year to $2.23 billion. Autoship, as the name suggests, enables Chewy’s customers to get certain products shipped automatically at a discount.\n\nThis is an essential part of the company’s business model since Autoship customer sales comprised 77.6% of Chewy’s net sales in Q1 of FY2024. I feel that the convenience of the subscription model is what made Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) the e-commerce behemoth that it is today. So, it’s a smart move for Chewy to focus strongly on its Autoship sales.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, Chewy’s revenue grew by 3.1% year-over-year to $2.88 billion, edging out the consensus estimate of $2.85 billion. Furthermore, Chewy reported adjusted earnings of $0.31 per share, up 55% year-over-year and far ahead of Wall Street’s consensus call for $0.20 per share.\n\nIs Chewy Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CHWY comes in as a Moderate Buy based on 13 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Chewy stock price target is $22.66, implying 6.2% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CHWY stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), with an average return of 27.34% per rating. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider Chewy Stock?\n\nAs we’ve discovered, Chewy handily beat the consensus EPS forecast and, to use Singh’s phrase again, delivered a “solid start” to the fiscal year. Meanwhile, CHWY stock appears to be bouncing off of a very low level, with a revisit of $100 being possible but not guaranteed.\n\nMoreover, Chewy is demonstrating excellent progress with the company’s Autoship program and is inspiring confidence through share buybacks. Hence, when all is said and done, I am strongly bullish on CHWY stock and believe it is worthy of consideration for a moderately-sized share position.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon exiting cargo partnership with Atlas Air",
        "content": "Atlas Air operates eight Boeing 737-800 freighters (pictured) for Amazon. Amazon provided the aircraft to Atlas to fly on its behalf but will now look to find another home for them. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nAtlas Air will stop flying freighter aircraft for Amazon in the online retailer’s parcel network over the next year, and 25 aircraft controlled by Amazon will gradually be relocated to other operators, according to company pilots who posted about the changes in chat rooms and one who spoke with FreightWaves.\n\nThe decision to discontinue flight operations appears to have been initiated by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Where the Amazon-branded planes will end up is unknown, although it is now clear a portion of the fleet will be transferred to rival ABX Air.\n\nAtlas Air will give up 17 Boeing 767-300 converted freighters and its entire fleet of Boeing 737-800 cargo jets, according to several pilots relaying news presented by CEO Michael Steen during a company town hall on Thursday. Under contracts scheduled to expire in 2026, Atlas provides crews, routine maintenance and insurance (CMI). Amazon is responsible for providing the aircraft, fuel and cargo.\n\nThe agreements give Amazon the option to terminate the contracts with 180 days of written notice, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission before Atlas was taken private in early 2023 by a consortium of investors led by Apollo Global Management. One of the circumstances allowing for early termination is a change of corporate control. The contract raises the possibility of Amazon paying a termination fee to Atlas Air, but whether that happens could not be determined.\n\n“If Amazon exercises any of these termination rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition,” Atlas Air Worldwide said in annual reports while it was a publicly traded company. Officials have not addressed how profitable the Amazon business has been in recent years, especially with a slowdown in domestic e-commerce volumes since the pandemic.\n\nThe 17 Boeing 767s operated by Atlas Air are owned by Atlas Air Worldwide’s leasing subsidiary, Titan Aviation, and leased to Amazon. The e-tailer, which separately hired Atlas to fly the aircraft, can now sign a CMI contract with another operator and have the aircraft transferred to its new partner. Amazon directly controls the eight 737-800s, which are leased from the Bank of Utah and are also expected to be placed with another cargo airline.\n\nAt least 10 of the 767s are expected to be placed on the operating certificate of ABX Air, one of two cargo airlines owned by Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG). In early May, ATSG announced that Amazon will provide 10 additional 767-300 freighters to operate on its behalf under a five-year contract and that ABX will begin flying in June. ATSG did not say where Amazon would obtain the aircraft.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has the right to place up to 10 more aircraft with ABX, which currently operates four B767-200s for Amazon. Sister airline Air Transport International operates more than 40 767s on Amazon’s behalf.\n\nAmazon owns nearly 20% of ATSG. It previously owned a stake in Atlas Air, but its shares were bought out by the new ownership group.\n\nAmazon’s other providers of outsourced air cargo service in the United States are Sun Country Airlines, which operates 737-800s, and Hawaiian Airlines, with two Airbus A330-300 converted freighters.\n\nAtlas Air declined to comment, citing a required quiet period on public statements ahead of financial reporting to bondholders on Thursday. Media representatives for Amazon did not respond to multiple requests for information about the company’s plans for its private airline.\n\nMoving forward without Amazon\n\nSteen, the Atlas CEO, said the company doesn’t plan on furloughing any pilots who choose to stay, according to several pilot accounts of the town hall. Although Atlas Air is adding eight widebody freighters to the fleet this year, there could be a surplus of pilots until the airline picks up new business, which could mean less pay as pilots share available flight hours. Junior officers would be most affected by any reductions.\n\nThe 767 pilots displaced by the loss of Amazon business could opt to fly Boeing 777s or 747s but would need additional training to be certified for a different aircraft type.\n\nAtlas Air is scheduled to receive two 777 production freighters from Boeing in the second half of the year. Trade publication Cargo Facts reported earlier this month that Atlas Air had purchased a pair of factory-built 747-400s that China Airlines retired from service in 2023.\n\nNippon Cargo Airlines last week renewed an agreement with Atlas to operate five of NCA’s 747-400 freighters between Asia and North America amid growing demand. Ocean shipping giant CMA CGM recently announced that it has struck a CMI agreement with Atlas Air to operate two Boeing 777 freighters on the trans-Pacific route, starting later this year. And YunExpress, a freight forwarder in China, in March signed a long-term charter agreement with Atlas for use of a second Boeing 777-200 freighter.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\n\nYunExpress charters Atlas Air freighters for US e-commerce service\n\nThe post Amazon exiting cargo partnership with Atlas Air appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Insight into Nygren's Latest Portfolio Adjustments and Key Financial Decisions\n\nBill Nygren (Trades, Portfolio), a seasoned portfolio manager at The Oakmark Fund, The Oakmark Select Fund, and the Oakmark Global Select Fund, has recently disclosed his investment activities for the first quarter of 2024.

        "title": "Ring Has a New Mission. ‘Hey, There’s Raccoons in My Backyard’",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For years, Ring touted its crime-fighting bona fides, selling smart doorbells that let homeowners remotely monitor their residences — and sometimes share what they recorded with local police. Now the Amazon.com Inc. unit is looking to transform itself into a smart-camera business with a cheery social-media side hustle, sort of a mashup between Nextdoor and TikTok.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers Wall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century\n\nPreviously users mostly shared videos of suspicious activity on Ring’s Neighbors app or browsed a map of police investigations. They still do, but now they’re more likely to post whimsical clips of pets, water balloon fights, a neighbor wearing a dinosaur costume.\n\n“Reduce crime in neighborhoods” was Ring’s original mission statement. Now it’s “Keeping people close to what’s important.”\n\nIt’s a big strategy shift, and one that seems to be working so far. Ring “recently” became profitable, according to Chief Executive Officer Liz Hamren, thanks to a recurring stream of subscription revenue from people willing to pay as much as $20 a month to save and share videos captured by their devices.\n\n“People want that recorded video,” said Hamren, who revealed Ring’s new mission statement in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg Television. “We have a really healthy subscription business.”\n\nIn each of the last three years, Ring either raised prices on some subscription plans or placed previously free features behind a paywall, moves that coincide with Amazon’s effort to turn its sprawling consumer electronics division into a sustainable business after pouring billions into the Alexa digital assistant.\n\nAbout half of recent video doorbell buyers in the US reported purchasing a Ring device, according to Parks Associates, which surveys buyers of smart-home devices. Ring is the largest smart camera maker and the second-largest seller of security systems, according to the researcher. The company has also made strides with its paid security monitoring services, which now trail only ADT Inc. in market share.\n\nRing’s pivot will come as little surprise to anyone familiar with the company’s travails. Founded by Jamie Siminoff in 2011 and acquired about seven years later by Amazon for $839 million, Ring’s crime-fighting focus soon became a public-relations liability. Civil liberties groups accused the company of building a private surveillance network vulnerable to abuse by the law enforcement agencies keen to get their hands on video captured by Ring devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternal employee guidance from Ring’s early days, reviewed by Bloomberg, sketched out a product lineup suitable for a high-tech fortress: concentric circles of protection around the front door (internet doorbells), the home (standalone cameras) and the neighborhood (the Neighbors app). Ring veterans say the guidance could be stifling, limiting the time they could devote to new features that might be useful to homeowners but lacked a clear home-security purpose.\n\nThe company also suffered embarrassing security lapses, including attacks by hackers exploiting weak user passwords to hijack cameras and employees watching unencrypted user videos. Amazon paid $5.8 million to settled Federal Trade Commission charges related to those episodes, even as it denied violating the law. The company in recent years mandated more secure two-factor authentication for users and began offering end-to-end encryption.\n\nLast year, Siminoff left Ring and was replaced by Hamren, a former Microsoft Corp. executive and alumnus of Dropcam, which made internet-connected cameras before being acquired by Google’s Nest division. Besides running Ring, Hamren also oversees Amazon’s Blink camera, Key in-home delivery services and Sidewalk wireless network.\n\nHamren, 52, lost little time loosening Ring’s ties to law enforcement. Earlier this year, the company removed a tool in the Neighbors app that had let police departments request footage directly from doorbell owners. The move was part of a broader push to turn the app into more of a community hub. Hamren says Ring remains focused on home-monitoring technology and currently has no plans to move into such smart-home devices as thermostats.\n\n“It’s not about home control, it’s not about managing your home, it’s about what’s happening,” she said. “That’s like, ‘Hey, there’s raccoons in my backyard. Six packages got delivered. There’s three cars in your driveway.’”\n\nOne vestige of Ring’s crime-fighting days lingers on, a flying indoor drone that can zoom around the home and investigate suspicious noises. When it was unveiled in 2020, Ring released a video of the drone chasing off a would-be burglar as the resident watched on a smartphone.\n\nInitially set to debut in 2021, the device remains in limbo. One person familiar with its development, speaking on the condition of anonymity, likened the Ring Always Home Cam to a concept car, a hype-building technology that may never hit the market.\n\nHamren insists Ring still plans to release the drone. She said she recently saw a demo of the device, and that engineers been working to make it quieter and to ensure it doesn’t slam into anything in homes with low or high ceilings, curved walls or mirrors. The challenge of navigating uncommon floor plans also delayed Amazon’s Astro home robot, which remains an invitation-only product.\n\nThe drone simply wasn’t ready to ship, Hamren said. “We have to be confident that it works in every home.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Elon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth Who Is Most Likely to Succeed at Elon High?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Seven firms representing various industries stand out as prospective high-yielders as the market approaches H2 2024. Each one has distinct development drivers and value propositions. These stocks cover a wide range of prospects indicative of the changing market landscape, from semiconductor discoveries to AI development, medicinal breakthroughs, and worldwide consumer brands.\n\nBecause of its economical and effective processors, the first one is becoming increasingly popular in the data center and cloud computing sectors. The latter is growing internationally, improving user experiences across its platforms, and making major strides in AI. The third is seeing a rapid increase in profitability and revenue due to the growing demand for AI-powered PCs and an enterprise refresh cycle.\n\nThe fourth one provides stability with its substantial interest revenue from floating-rate loans and a deliberate move toward safer first-lien loans. With a varied pipeline in cancer and other therapeutic areas, the fifth one keeps innovating while guaranteeing consistent revenue growth. The sixth one employs strategic initiatives for global expansion in the face of setbacks. Lastly, the seventh shows strong revenue growth and rising user satisfaction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMust-Own Stocks: AMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite a historically weak first quarter (Q1 2024), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) boosted its share of server CPU revenue thanks to growing cloud deployments and business acceptance. Globally, about 900 public instances are using AMD processors. This is due to the expansion of fourth-generation EPYC processors applied by major cloud providers, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Hence, this widespread usage highlights AMD’s expanding market share in cloud computing.\n\nMoreover, strong demand for Ryzen 8000 series CPUs drove 85% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth for the Client division. Sales of Ryzen desktop CPUs increased by double digits compared to the previous year, while sales of Ryzen mobile CPUs almost doubled. The introduction of Ryzen Pro 8000 CPUs with AI capabilities and performance that lead the industry solidifies AMD’s leadership in the commercial PC market.\n\nFinally, with a 10% yearly rise to $1.7 billion in operating expenditures, AMD’s aggressive R&D and marketing spending to take advantage of AI growth potential is evident. Hence, this strategic investment is essential to continue innovation and keep a competitive edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Llama 3 model-poweredMeta (NASDAQ:META) AI marks a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, with its 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models being acknowledged as best-in-class. In addition, the 400+ billion parameter model’s continuous evolution is expected to establish industry standards.\n\nFurthermore, positive feedback has been received from tens of millions of people who have previously interacted with Meta AI. This early widespread acceptance is indicative of the AI’s efficacy and user-friendliness. Meta AI’s potential to produce real-time, high-quality pictures and animations greatly improves the user experience on several platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and more. Hence, these improvements raise engagement levels and draw in additional people.\n\nBy providing early copies of its products to a select group of users for feedback and further enhancements, Meta’s strategy guarantees that the final product will be improved before being made available to a larger audience. In the past, this approach has worked well for product launches. Therefore, the methodical extension of Meta AI into other languages and nations suggests a well-organized strategy to boost user base and engagement on a worldwide scale.\n\nMust-Own Stocks: Intel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has released positive Q1 earnings, with sales matching expectations and EPS above forecasts. Revenue for the first quarter increased by 9% YOY to $12.7 billion. Consequently, the business exceeded the forecast by 5 cents and produced a non-GAAP EPS of 18 cents, demonstrating that Intel’s methodical approach to cutting costs has the desired effect. Indeed, strong profitability and sound financial standing are reflected in higher-than-expected EPS, which is essential to finance the following expansion projects.\n\nAdditionally, Intel expects several important variables to support sequential sales growth throughout the year and into 2025. AI PCs (AIPCs) are gaining pace due to their enterprise renewal cycle. Since December 2023, over 5 million AI PCs have been shipped due to the release of Intel Core Ultra CPUs. By the end of 2024, Intel anticipates exceeding its previous prediction of 40 million AI PCs.\n\nOverall, these patterns show a strong market need for AI-driven solutions and new enterprise technologies, two crucial areas for Intel. Thus, they exceed expectations due to a rising market share and robust product acceptability.\n\nOaktree Specialty Lending (OCSL) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nOaktree Specialty Lending (NASDAQ:OCSL) announced a Net Investment Income (NII) of 56 cents per share (Q2 2024), less than the 57 cents per share recorded in the prior quarter. This minor decline indicates the company’s continued strong earnings. The timing of capital deployments and repayments over the quarter caused the marginal decline. This shows that timing variations may affect quarterly profits despite the high overall earnings power.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s strategic change toward first-lien loans dropped the weighted average portfolio spread by 0.10% throughout the quarter. On Sept. 30, 2022, first-lien investments comprised 71% of the portfolio; second-lien investments dropped from 16% to 5% by the same date. Lastly, although it may result in somewhat lower returns, this move to safer, first-lien loans is a risk mitigation approach that improves the portfolio’s credit quality.\n\nMust-Own Stocks: Pfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor Q1 2024, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) announced total revenues of $14.9 billion. Pfizer managed an 11% operating revenue gain, excluding COVID-related medications (Comirnaty and Paxlovid), despite a 19% YOY fall in demand for these products. The company’s non-COVID product portfolio demonstrates good underlying performance across various therapeutic areas, which drove this rise. Undoubtedly, this operational growth reflects Pfizer’s ability to shift its focus from its COVID-19 pandemic revenue drivers to other business areas. This indicates the company’s resiliency and smart reallocation of resources.\n\nMoreover, Pfizer’s cancer business showed noteworthy expansion, with oncology sales rising operationally YOY by 19%. Commercial solid execution and integration of Seagen’s products greatly supported this expansion. This rise is indicative of Pfizer’s compelling foray into the cancer sector. Here, it used both internal development and acquisitions to propel growth. Lastly, this tendency is further supported by the acceptance and high demand for novel medications like Padcev and the ongoing efficacy of well-established therapies like Xtandi.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) maintained its global development efforts in Q2 2024. Despite operational difficulties, the company added 364 net new locations to its total count of 38,951 worldwide. Notably, the U.S. and China remain important markets for the corporation, accounting for 61% of its global portfolio. Starbucks’ confidence in its long-term development prospects and dedication to seizing new market possibilities are evident in this planned expansion.\n\nAdditionally, Starbucks’ digital initiatives — such as Mobile Order & Pay (MOP) and the Starbucks app — keep boosting convenience and consumer engagement. Customers’ significant acceptance rate of MOP reflects that 31% of all transactions during the quarter were MOP transactions. In addition, Starbucks intends to make the Starbucks app available to all users in July to improve accessibility and encourage the acquisition and retention of consumers via digital channels.\n\nFinally, to lessen the strain on its margins, Starbucks focuses on achieving cost reductions and operational efficiency.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) EPS increased significantly, rising 27% on a non-GAAP basis YOY to $1.08 in Q1 2024. EPS would have climbed by around 20% even under the company’s previous non-GAAP methodology. This did not account for the impact of stock-based compensation. Furthermore, this substantial rise in earnings implies that PayPal’s business model is extremely successful and has the potential to yield significant returns for investors.\n\nMoreover, the number of monthly active accounts rose by 2% YOY to 220 million, demonstrating consistent user involvement with the platform. On a trailing 12-month basis, the number of transactions per active account climbed by 13% to 60, indicating a rise in user engagement and transaction volume.\n\nFinally, PayPal’s strategy priority is expanding its services for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and major organizations. Thus, programs like the PayPal Complete Payments platform, intended for SMBs, have gained traction, as 7% of SMB activity is currently being processed using this platform.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, META, INTC, OCSL, PFE, SBUX and PYPL.

        "content": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which saw its share price drive 111% higher over five years.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver half a decade, Amazon.com managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 16% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 50.30, the market remains optimistic.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Amazon.com has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 50% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 16% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before deciding if you like the current share price, check how Amazon.com scores on these 3 valuation metrics.\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "AWS and SAP Unlock New Innovation with Generative AI",
        "content": "Generative AI hub in SAP AI Core integrates with foundation models in Amazon Bedrock to deliver generative AI-driven insights and streamline manual processes for enterprise customers\n\nSEATTLE & WALLDORF, Germany, May 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and SAP SE (NYSE: SAP) today announced an expanded, strategic collaboration to transform modern cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) experiences and help enterprises drive new capabilities and efficiencies with generative artificial intelligence (AI). Together, AWS and SAP are striving to make it easier for customers to adopt the RISE with SAP solution on AWS, to improve the performance and efficiency of SAP workloads running in the cloud, and to embed generative AI into an enterprise’s entire portfolio of business-critical applications.\n\n\"AWS was the first cloud provider certified to support the SAP portfolio and today, thousands of enterprise companies run SAP solutions on AWS to get the most out of their mission-critical applications,\" said Matt Garman, incoming CEO at AWS. \"Now, AWS and SAP are making it faster and easier for companies to apply generative AI to their core business data to become more efficient, responsive, and sustainable.\"\n\n\"Partnerships like this collaboration with AWS are critical as we embed generative AI solutions across our ERP applications so that customers can drive innovation at an accelerated pace,\" said Christian Klein, Chief Executive Officer, SAP SE. \"In addition to delivering modern cloud ERP to our joint customers, we are excited to support Amazon on their own transformation journey as they adopt RISE with SAP for pioneering areas such as Project Kuiper, Amazon’s satellite initiative intended to increase global broadband access.\"\n\nGenerative AI models from Amazon Bedrock available on the generative AI hub in SAP AI Core\n\nThe generative AI hub in SAP AI Core infrastructure provides customers with secure access to a broad range of large language models (LLMs) that can easily be integrated into SAP business applications. With the integration of generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, SAP customers will be able to access high-performing LLMs and other foundation models (FMs) to build applications customized with their own data. Tens of thousands of customers use Amazon Bedrock to easily, quickly and securely build and scale generative AI applications using FMs from leading AI companies such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this integration, SAP customers may accelerate the adoption of generative AI and modernize key business processes built on SAP solutions. These innovations can be used in embedded use cases within RISE with SAP and the intelligent scenario lifecycle management functionality as an integration component or side-by-side directly on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). SAP and AWS plan to expand the use of Bedrock capabilities in the generative AI hub to further enable embedded AI functionality within SAP’s portfolio of cloud solutions and applications. This includes additional use cases across finance and product lifecycle management.\n\nSAP to use AWS chips to train and deploy future SAP business AI offerings\n\nSAP’s use of AWS Graviton3 chips to support SAP HANA Cloud helps to deliver performance gains, cost savings, and energy efficiency to SAP. By using Graviton3-based Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, SAP has realized up to 30% better compute for analytical workloads and an estimated 45% reduction in carbon footprint for SAP HANA Cloud. Now SAP and AWS are collaborating on the next generation of Graviton4 for SAP HANA Cloud and additional SAP applications to continue to improve performance and efficiency. Based on the success of running SAP HANA Cloud on AWS Graviton, SAP plans to use AWS Graviton to support SAP solutions and applications such as SAP BTP, SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, and the SAP Cloud ALM solution.\n\nSAP plans to use AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips, purpose built for AI and machine learning (ML) workloads, for training and deploying future SAP Business AI offerings. Using Trainium and Inferentia2-based instances in a proof of concept, SAP engineers trained and fine-tuned generative AI LLMs in two days versus 23 days with comparable Amazon EC2 instances. By leveraging Trainium's specialized architecture designed for efficient ML model training, SAP can accelerate the development process while maintaining high levels of accuracy and reliability.\n\nIncreased performance for RISE with SAP on AWS\n\nThousands of customers have selected RISE with SAP on AWS to run their largest, most complex, global SAP solution implementations. Now generally available, the next-generation Amazon EC2 High Memory U7i instances offer up to 32TiB of memory in a single instance and provide customers the memory and flexibility they need to support expanding SAP HANA database requirements. Amazon EC2 High Memory U7i instances are the first DDR5 memory-based 8-socket offering by a leading cloud provider to improve the performance of memory-intensive applications such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud as part of RISE with SAP.\n\nAmazon’s Project Kuiper selects RISE with SAP\n\nAmazon companies, including Twitch, Zappos.com, and Zoox Inc., already use SAP software on AWS to support their operations. And now Project Kuiper—Amazon’s satellite broadband network—is deploying RISE with SAP to support its complex supply chain and manufacturing operations, and get the best performance and most value out of its mission-critical SAP software. Running SAP solutions on AWS allows Kuiper to take advantage of the latest SAP capabilities embedded in RISE with SAP to help drive impactful transformation, accelerating company decisions and enhancing overall performance and productivity. Hundreds of millions of people lack adequate internet access and Project Kuiper’s goal is to help close the digital divide by delivering fast, affordable broadband to a wide variety of customers operating in places without reliable internet connections. Delivering on that vision requires Kuiper to build satellites at an unprecedented rate. RISE with SAP allows the Project Kuiper team to leverage the most reliable and scalable infrastructure to run a modern, cloud ERP as a managed service, so they can focus on innovation instead of IT management.\n\nTo learn more about the SAP and AWS partnership, tune in to the SAP Sapphire conference, June 3-5, in Orlando.\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

        "title": "Prediction: This \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be the Next to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "There are only four companies in the world with a market capitalization of at least $2 trillion: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet. Each of these megacap tech businesses are members of the Magnificent Seven -- a friendly moniker used to collectively describe the biggest movers and shakers in all things related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile Microsoft and Apple have been valued in excess of $2 trillion for quite some time, Nvidia reached the milestone earlier this year. Alphabet was minted into the club following an impressive first-quarter earnings report a few weeks ago.\n\nThere is one other member of the Magnificent Seven sitting on the doorstep of a $2 trillion valuation. E-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) currently boasts a market capitalization of $1.9 trillion.\n\nNot only does Amazon's entrance into the $2 trillion club look inevitable, but I think it'll arrive sooner than later. Let's explore how Amazon is igniting new waves of growth across the business, and assess if now is a good time to scoop up shares.\n\nAmazon's newest $100 billion business\n\nWhen you think of Amazon, you probably think of its e-commerce marketplace. Over the last two decades, Amazon has become the de facto landing page for online shoppers. Unsurprisingly, online sales consistently ranks as Amazon's largest source of revenue.\n\nHowever, another area that Amazon helped pioneer is cloud computing. Indeed, Microsoft, Alphabet, Oracle, and many other tech titans all operate in the fiercely competitive cloud realm. Yet similar to its e-commerce blueprint, Amazon has made significant investments over many years, which has helped the company build the largest cloud platform on the market today.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, Amazon generated 17% growth year over year from its cloud division -- reaching $25 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now officially on a $100 billion revenue run rate, and is the company's third-largest business.\n\nOne of the more important investments Amazon has made to spur some acceleration in the cloud business is in generative AI. Last September, the company invested $4 billion into a start-up called Anthropic. The deal presents some strategic benefits for Amazon, and specifically as it pertains to the cloud.\n\nAnthropic is using AWS as its primary cloud provider, and is training its AI models on Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia graphics processing units (GPUs). These moves are imperative for Amazon to maintain its leadership position among cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, I see the real tailwinds from Anthropic stemming from lead generation. The inclusion of Anthropic in the AWS ecosystem should play a big role in accelerating sales of new AI-powered products such as Amazon Bedrock and more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMountains of cash\n\nIt's encouraging to see that Amazon's top line is growing and that the company has clear ambitions in AI. However, the obvious concern about all of this is that these investments come with a hefty price tag.\n\nFear not! Not only is Amazon's revenue accelerating, but the company's financial flexibility is downright jaw-dropping. Over the last 12 months, Amazon has generated $50 billion of free cash flow.\n\nIn addition to Anthropic and home-grown semiconductor chips, Amazon also recently announced an $11 billion investment to build out data centers. Considering that Amazon ended the first quarter with $85 billion of cash on the balance sheet, I'm not worried about the company's spending spree. Throughout its history, Amazon has proven one thing over and over again: The company's managers are terrific capital allocators.\n\nBuilding best-in-class e-commerce and cloud computing technologies is no easy feat. And yet, the investments Amazon has made over the decades have resulted in multiple businesses eclipsing $100 billion in sales. Furthermore, as these businesses have scaled, Amazon has achieved a high degree of operating efficiency in the form of consistent and robust profits.\n\nAI is the next frontier at Amazon, and the company is going back to its original playbook: Making investments today to lay the groundwork for tomorrow.\n\nNext stop? $2 trillion\n\nOver the last year, shares of Amazon have risen 56% -- handily topping the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. With shares hovering near all-time highs, it's fair to say that Amazon's valuation has become a bit stretched. But even so, at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.3, Amazon stock looks like a good buy right now compared to historical levels. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThink of it this way: 10 years ago, Amazon was a drastically different business. And yet today, even with all of the progress the company has made in the cloud and the soaring profitability metrics, the company's P/S is only narrowly higher than its 10-year average.\n\nThe key ideas here are that Amazon is emerging as a leader in AI, and the company's accelerating sales and cash flow undermine its ability to grow and do so in a prudent fashion. I think now is a great time to scoop up shares of Amazon and hold for the long run -- $2 trillion and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry just made a big bet on gold — and dumped tech giants Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry just made a big bet on gold — and dumped tech giants Alphabet and Amazon\n\nMichael Burry’s moves tend to make headlines.\n\nThe hedge fund manager famously bet against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and won big — a move that was depicted in the hit movie “The Big Short.”\n\nSince then his investments have been closely watched.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nAccording to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Burry’s company Scion Asset Management has made quite a few adjustments to its portfolio in Q1 of 2024.\n\nAmong Burry’s notable moves were selling his stakes in Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) and increasing his holdings of Chinese companies JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA).\n\nBurry also made a substantial bet on gold by purchasing 440,729 shares of Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), valued at $7.6 million at the end of Q1, making it the fifth-largest position in his portfolio. The closed-end fund's official website says it holds “substantially all of its assets in physical gold bullion.”\n\nA unique feature of the Sprott Physical Gold Trust is that investors have the right to redeem their units for physical metals on a monthly basis, provided they meet the minimum redemption amount. This requirement is quite substantial, as \"a unitholder must have enough units to equate to one full-sized London Good Delivery bar (approximately 400 oz).\"\n\nGold’s gleaming rise\n\nGold is already experiencing a remarkable surge. At the beginning of this year, the precious metal was trading at $2,062 per ounce. Today, it’s at $2,357 per ounce, reflecting a 14.3% increase.\n\nTo put this into perspective, gold has outpaced the S&P 500, which has gained 11.7% over the same period.\n\nThere are many reasons why investors might want to add gold to their portfolios. One notable reason is inflation. Inflation often arises from central banks' ability to freely print fiat money. Gold, however, cannot be created out of thin air. Its relative scarcity and durability make it a reliable hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power when paper currency loses value.\n\nAdditionally, gold can act as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tension. During periods of market volatility or global instability, investors often turn to gold for its stability and reliability. This precious metal has historically maintained its value, making it a trusted asset in uncertain times.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nFor those looking to follow Burry's lead and add a touch of gold to their portfolios, here are three easy ways to do it.\n\nBuy gold bullion\n\nThe most straightforward way to invest in gold is to buy physical gold in the form of bars or coins.\n\nGold bullion can be purchased from reputable dealers and stored securely at home or in a safety deposit box.\n\nThe advantage of owning physical gold is its stability and tangibility, providing a sense of security and ownership that isn't dependent on financial institutions. However, it requires secure storage and insurance, which can add to the overall cost of investment.\n\nInvest in gold stocks/ETFs\n\nInvestors can also purchase shares of gold mining companies. When the price of gold rises, miners tend to enjoy bigger profits, potentially boosting the value of their stocks.\n\nAdding gold mining companies to your portfolio can provide diversification. However, keep in mind that doing so also exposes investors to market risks and the performance of the underlying companies.\n\nIn addition, there are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of gold. These ETFs aim to mirror the price movements of gold by holding physical gold or gold futures contracts.\n\nBecause gold ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, investors have the ability to buy or sell shares at market prices throughout the trading day. They provide a convenient way to gain exposure to gold without the need for physical storage or dealing with the logistics of buying and selling bullion.\n\nInvest in a gold IRA\n\nIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are a popular way to save for retirement, offering tax advantages that can help grow your savings over time. Traditional IRAs allow you to contribute pre-tax income, with taxes deferred until you withdraw the funds during retirement. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, involve contributions made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\n\nA gold individual retirement account (IRA) is a specific type of IRA that allows investors to include physical gold and other precious metals in their retirement savings. This type of IRA offers the same tax advantages as traditional and Roth IRAs but provides the added benefit of diversifying your portfolio with tangible assets. Gold IRAs are appealing because gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, helping to protect your retirement savings from market volatility.\n\nThere are drawbacks, like relatively lower returns, no dividends and fees you have to pay to buy and store the actual metal.\n\nIf you believe in the yellow metal’s long-term potential, a gold IRA could be a valuable addition to your retirement strategy. However, make sure it’s only a small part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "content": "Adoption of renewable energy has been on the rise across the globe. Everything from government subsidies to growing consumer consciousness has driven its rise. Solar and wind energy typically receive much of the spotlight (and investment dollars). Still, other sources of renewable energy, particularly hydrogen, deserve more attention.

Moreover, Plug Power has helped logistics companies, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), reduce their carbon footprint by providing them with their GenDrive hydrogen fuel cells for electric lift trucks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite boasting a robust technology stack, Plug Power has struggled to increase sales substantially while costs have burgeoned out of proportion. For example, at the end of 2023, revenue increased to $891 million, but net loss doubled YOY to $1.4 billion.\n\nPlug Power’s management is aware of this cash mismanagement, per their Q1 2024 earnings update. Still, the hydrogen firm’s “enhance[d] focus on cash management” has yet to materialize into healthier margins. PLUG shares have already plummeted nearly 28% on a YTD-basis, making PLUG one of the hydrogen stocks to sell.\n\nNikola (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nNikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is an electric vehicle maker that focuses on hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles for the trucking sector. The EV maker received a lot of hype back during the earlier stages of the pandemic years. Nikola had IPO’d via a special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC) in 2020 and had been valued at over $3.3 billion. After becoming public, Nikola’s stock reached several highs, one being the company boasting a market capitalization of $28.7 billion.\n\nLooking at Nikola’s current valuation of $714 million, the EV maker has certainly fallen out of favor. A report from Hindenburg Research in late 2020 showcased how the company and its founder Trevor Milton misled investors on multiple occasions. In December 2023, a Manhattan court sentenced Trevor Milton to 4 years in prison for misleading investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nNKLA share price certainly has in no way recovered, trading at about $0.53/share. If you’re an investor who is still holding this stock, now may be the time to sell.\n\nBallard Power Systems (BLDP) Ballard Power Systems Inc logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nBallard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) is in the business of designing, manufacturing, and selling PEM fuel cell products. Similar to Plug Power, Ballard Power has focused on developing fuel cells for clean energy vehicles. Ballard Power’s “heavy-duty modules” have between 45 kW and 120kW of net power and are designed for buses, trucks, and trains. The hydrogen firm also offers fuel cell systems for reliable power generation.\n\nWhile receiving robust demand from European transportation companies, Ballard Power’s order backlog grew 38% sequentially in Q1 2024 to $180.5 million. Whether Ballard Power can reasonably and efficiently execute on this order backlog remains to be seen. The firm delivered around $14.5 million worth of orders in Q1 2024 despite starting the period with $130.5 million worth of orders. This perhaps indicates an elongated ramp-up period and would explain Ballard Power’s need to create another manufacturing facility in Rockwall, Texas.\n\nBallard Power will likely continue to lag in terms of delivering its fuel cell products until it completes building the facility. BLDP shares have fallen more than 16% on a YTD basis.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Not that it's a contest, but a company's relative size -- as measured by revenue, earnings, or market cap -- can be a clear indication of its past and present success. More to the point, relative changes to any of these metrics can help investors spot where the real growth is ... and isn't.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three companies that could be bigger than Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) within the next decade. And that's saying something. The iPhone maker's current market cap stands at $2.9 trillion, making it the world's second-biggest publicly traded company (right behind Microsoft).\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nWhen most investors think of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, names like Microsoft or Nvidia come to mind. Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) generally doesn't.\n\nBut maybe it should.\n\nBroadcom manufactures many of the components you'll find in wireless connectivity tech like Wi-Fi routers and wireless modems. It also makes fiber-optic connectivity equipment and Ethernet networking solutions, as well as software that gets the most out of this hardware. Without this company's solutions, the wireless connectivity landscape would look considerably different.\n\nThere's a very specific reason Broadcom could be a bigger company than Apple 10 years from now, though. That's the market Broadcom is quietly penetrating: artificial intelligence (AI). In short, this company makes the chips that AI data centers need but most people never think about.\n\nFor example, take Broadcom's 200G/lane vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), unveiled earlier this year. This is the industry's first such fiber-optic equipment capable of handling the massive loads of digital data being processed and delivered by AI platforms.\n\nAlso earlier this year, the company introduced the industry's first 51.2 terabits-per-second (Tbps) co-packaged optics Ethernet switch, which not only connects multiple processors to one another at blazing-fast speed, but does it using 70% less power than comparable tech. This equipment doesn't compete with Nvidia's processors, but it does complement Nvidia's wares.\n\nAll told, Broadcom expects to sell on the order of $10 billion worth of AI-oriented chips this year. For perspective, that's roughly 10% of the company's projected 2024 top line. This amount still only scratches the surface, though. Straits Research believes the AI infrastructure market is poised to grow at an annualized pace of nearly 21% per year through 2030.\n\nAlready a leader in this overlooked piece of the AI market, Broadcom is positioned to capture more than its fair share of its growth. That growth could readily push its current market cap of $650 billion beyond Apple's down the road. This is particularly true since Apple's business is changing from a growth-oriented one driven by iPhone sales to a slower-moving, value-oriented/cash-cow enterprise led by its services arm.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd speaking of value...\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nWhile Broadcom is a technology growth stock, not every great opportunity has to come from this category of tickers. Indeed, don't be surprised to see incredible growth from a name at the extreme other end of this spectrum -- a value-oriented holding like Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nSurprised? It would be a bit unusual if you weren't. Value stocks are so-called largely because these companies aren't capable of great growth. Their strong suit is consistent cash flow that often translates into reliable dividends. It's no secret that Warren Buffett -- the chief guru behind Berkshire Hathaway -- is content to leave $189 billion of Berkshire's cash uninvested simply because he doesn't see any such stocks worth buying at their present price.\n\nBut there's a very specific strategic reason you might want to consider stepping into a stake in Berkshire Hathaway sooner rather than later: We may be on the verge of a years-long wave of strong performance from value stocks.\n\nUnderpinning this prediction is the current economic backdrop. Interest rates are high, inflation is high, and debt (corporate as well as consumer) is both high and expensive. Although not necessarily recession-causing, these are conditions that often work against growth stocks but aren't overly problematic for value stocks. A handful of value-oriented sectors with strong pricing power -- like utilities and consumer staples -- can thrive in such an environment.\n\nSure, it's a bit concerning that Berkshire would rather do nothing with its idle cash than at least take a shot on a low-risk dividend payer. If its capital isn't put to work, the company's market cap -- currently near $900 billion -- may never reach or eclipse Apple's current capitalization of just under $3 trillion.\n\nDon't worry about it too much, though. Most of Berkshire Hathaway's value is represented by existing holdings in value stocks or privately owned companies. And over the coming decade, Buffett or his deputies will surely find a few more opportunities worth diving into.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nLast but not least, add e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) to your list of companies that could be bigger than Apple 10 years from now.\n\nIt has one of the shortest distances to travel. Amazon's current market cap is a whopping $1.9 trillion versus Apple's $2.9 trillion. Granted, Amazon's highest-growth days are also likely in the rearview mirror, and even if Apple's future isn't as compelling as its past it's still making forward progress.\n\nThere is something new about Amazon, however, that could still easily catapult it beyond Apple by 2034. That's the fact that Amazon is finally focused on profitability as much as -- if not more than -- it is on revenue growth. Last quarter's net income margin percentage of 6.4% (of revenue) is the most profitable the company's ever been since the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was an obvious boon for its business. The same quarter's gross profit margin of 47.6% is also a company record, extending a long streak of steady improvement since 2012.\n\nWhat's driving this margin growth? Most investors know the company's cloud computing business is considerably more profitable than its e-commerce operation. Indeed, although Amazon Web Services (AWS) only accounts for about 16% of Amazon's top line, AWS is responsible for roughly two-thirds of the company's operating income. This business's growth is doing more than its fair share of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe piece of the bullish thesis not fully appreciated by interested investors, however, is actually on the e-commerce front. This arm is now more profitable than it's ever been. Nearly 6% of last quarter's North American sales were turned into operating income, while its longtime money-losing international e-commerce operation has swung back into the black, after finally achieving profitability during and because of the pandemic.\n\nWhatever's been missing from the formula -- maybe it was just scale -- is now in place. Most investors don't seem to see this yet, but they will, as Amazon continues to make the most of its massive size and its now fine-tuned operation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "So far, Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Shares jumped 173% during the past year as the company reported unprecedented demand for its graphics processing units or GPUs, chips that power all of the most advanced AI systems.\n\nHowever, some billionaire hedge fund managers trimmed their positions in Nvidia during the first quarter, while purchasing shares of two other AI stocks: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Salesforce(NYSE: CRM).\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,004 shares of Nvidia stock, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, he increased his positions in Amazon and Salesforce by 32% and 36%, respectively. Those stocks rank as his largest and 12th-largest holdings, respectively, excluding options. Louis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 19%. He also increased his stake in Amazon by 18% and opened a new position in Salesforce. Those stocks rank as his largest and sixth-largest holdings, respectively, excluding options. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2,937,060 shares of Nvidia stock, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in Amazon by 3% and doubled his stake in Salesforce. Those stocks rank as his second- and fourth-largest holdings, respectively.\n\nInvestors need not interpret those trades to mean Nvidia is a poor investment. All three hedge fund managers still have a stake in the chipmaker. But Amazon and Salesforce warrant further consideration. Here are the important details.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe in terms of gross merchandise sales, and strength in retail has allowed the company to build a booming digital advertising business. Amazon is the biggest retail media company in the United States, and the third-biggest adtech company worldwide. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the market in cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue.\n\nAmazon is using artificial intelligence (AI) to create monetization opportunities and boost efficiency across its different businesses. In e-commerce, it recently announced a generative AI shopping assistant called Rufus that will help consumers find and compare products. Amazon also debuted a generative AI assistant for sellers that streamlines the creation of product pages. Finally, the company uses AI in its logistics business to manage inventory and optimize delivery routes.\n\nIn advertising, Amazon uses machine learning to ensure consumers see the most relevant advertisements. That ultimately translates into more successful campaigns for marketers, which makes Amazon an even more attractive advertising partner. The company has also launched a generative AI tool that lets brands turn product profile photos into lifestyle images.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn cloud computing, AWS is already well positioned to benefit from AI given its leadership in cloud infrastructure and platform services, but the company has also introduced new products. Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that lets brands customize pretrained large language models and build generative AI applications. Amazon Q is a conversational assistant that can summarize information and automate tasks like coding.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Amazon to grow earnings per share at 24% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 50 times earnings look relatively reasonable. Indeed, Amazon is trading near its cheapest earnings multiple in two years. I would feel comfortable buying this AI stock today, and I think patient investors should consider doing the same.\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce is the market leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software, and its market share exceeds that of the next four competitors combined. Its platform brings together productivity applications for sales, customer service, marketing, and commerce. Salesforce will undoubtedly benefit as core CRM spending grows, but two new products extend its addressable opportunities in the adjacent areas of data management and automation.\n\nFirst, Data Cloud unifies customer data from across internal sources (Salesforce CRM software) and external sources (third-party data platforms), and it lets users activate that data to automate workflows, personalize the customer experience, and develop AI applications. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff says Data Cloud is the fastest-growing product in company history.\n\nSecond, Einstein Copilot is a natural language interface that leans on generative AI to automate tasks across the CRM platform. For instance, Einstein can summarize information and surface relevant insights for sales and customer service teams. It can also assist commerce teams in developing digital storefronts, and it can help marketing teams create advertising campaigns.\n\nCRM spending is forecast to grow at 13.9% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Salesforce should benefit from that tailwind in any case, but especially because Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot add value to pre-existing products and create cross-sell opportunities for the company. Indeed, Benioff said he believes \"Data Cloud will become the heart and soul\" of the Salesforce CRM platform as businesses invest in AI, simply because AI must be rooted in good data to be effective.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Salesforce to grow earnings per share at 21% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 64.8 times earnings looks quite pricey. Of course, Salesforce may grow earnings more quickly than analysts expect, but I would wait for a cheaper valuation multiple before buying this stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge in Seattle on Tuesday rejected Amazon.com's request to dismiss a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit that accuses the company of enrolling millions of consumers into its paid Amazon Prime service without their consent.\n\nAttorneys for Amazon had urged U.S. District Judge John Chun to dismiss the FTC's claims. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe FTC lawsuit filed in June 2023 accusing the retailer of deceptive practices. It argued Amazon made it hard to cancel and knew that a percentage of consumers accidentally signed up for Prime and that some consumers were charged for multiple months before they canceled their memberships.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmazon urged Chun to dismiss the FTC lawsuit, arguing the company \"prominently and repeatedly\" disclosed key terms - including price and automatic renewal - to Prime customers. Amazon also accused the FTC of seeking to punish the company through \"undefined concepts\" such as \"manipulative\" website designs.\n\nAmazon used \"manipulative, coercive or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically renewing Prime subscriptions,\" the FTC said, which has sought civil penalties and a permanent injunction to prevent future violations.\n\nThe lawsuit is part of the Biden administration's ongoing regulatory and enforcement squeeze on big technology companies.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, the FTC in September accused Amazon of violating U.S. antitrust law in business practices that restrict merchants from offering lower prices than Amazon's. That case is also pending in Chun's Seattle court and set for trial in October 2026.\n\nThe FTC's Prime lawsuit said Amazon \"under substantial pressure\" from the FTC changed its cancellation process in April, before the agency filed its lawsuit. The complaint said \"Amazon still requires five clicks on desktop and six on mobile for consumers to cancel from Amazon.com.\"\n\nA 10-day non-jury trial in the case is scheduled for February 2025.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Christopher Cushing)",

        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is composed of 500 stocks from 11 different sectors, including information technology, energy, financials, and real estate. While it is the most diversified of the major U.S. stock market indexes, a select few technology stocks are having a growing influence over its performance thanks to their meteoric rise in value.\n\nAs of this writing, the following five companies have a combined market capitalization of $12.5 trillion, accounting for 27.3% of the total value of the entire S&P 500:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $2.9 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $2.8 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $1.9 trillion.\n\nThe S&P 500 index is up 11.5% in 2024 so far. However, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index -- which assigns an equal weighting to every stock regardless of its market cap -- is up just 4.9%. The difference can be explained (in large part) by the average year-to-date gain of 26.3% in the above five stocks, which highlights their influence over the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are using that experience (and their vast financial resources) to dominate new industries like artificial intelligence (AI). If they succeed, they could become even more influential over the S&P 500.\n\n1. Microsoft: 7.2% of the S&P 500\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company. It was founded in 1975, and some of its flagship products like Windows and Word are still used by billions of people today. Microsoft has expanded beyond software and into gaming, hardware (computers and devices), internet search, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the company agreed to invest $10 billion in AI start-up OpenAI, which created the ChatGPT online chatbot. Microsoft is integrating OpenAI's technology into most of its products to deliver more value for users. The Bing search engine, for example, now features a chatbot interface, and applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel are benefiting from AI's ability to rapidly craft content from text to videos.\n\nMicrosoft has cemented itself as a leader in AI thanks to the OpenAI partnership, and its products will continue to benefit from the start-up's lightning-paced innovation.\n\n2. Apple: 6.2% of the S&P 500\n\nApple makes some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, with 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. That includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. The iPhone also led to successful, billion-dollar spinoff devices like the Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's enormous installed base makes it the perfect distributor of AI software to consumers. The latest iPhone 15 Pro already comes with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, designed to process some AI workloads on-device. The company is reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet to decide which AI models will power its future devices, so consumers should expect its next iteration of chips to come with even greater processing capabilities.\n\nEventually, devices like the iPhone might come with advanced AI assistants capable of answering complex questions and crafting emails and social media content (among other things). Modern smartphones are simply pocket-sized computers, and, generally speaking, they have made humanity far more productive. AI is set to accelerate that trend.\n\n3. Nvidia: 5.9% of the S&P 500\n\nGenerative AI is developed, trained, and deployed in large, centralized data centers. Nvidia designs the graphics processing chips (GPUs) that fill those data centers, and they are the most sought-after in the industry among AI developers. During fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU drove the company's data center revenue to $47.5 billion, which was a whopping 217% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company just reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), and growth in its data center revenue accelerated to 427%. The H100 buoyed sales, but shipments of the new H200 GPU are set to begin in Q2. It can inference (the process of feeding live data to an AI model so it can make predictions) twice as fast as the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which could trigger another demand wave from leading data center operators like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\n\nIn essence, Nvidia remains far ahead of its competitors, and the development of next-generation AI models won't be possible without its GPUs. The company plans to launch a new series of chips later this year that are built on its latest Blackwell architecture, and they will deliver even greater performance.\n\n4. Alphabet: 4.3% of the S&P 500\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, and it's also home to other tech subsidiaries like YouTube, autonomous driving company Waymo, and AI developer DeepMind. Google Search remains Alphabet's largest source of revenue, but investors have questioned whether AI chatbots could unseat its dominance, given their ability to provide an instant answer to practically any question.\n\nData is king when it comes to AI, and since Google Search has been the window to the entire internet for more than two decades, it has more valuable information than practically any company on Earth. This allowed Alphabet to develop its own AI models, culminating in its latest Gemini lineup, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4 models. In some tests, Gemini is as good, if not better, at understanding and generating text, images, videos, and computer code.\n\nGoogle also embedded generative AI into its traditional search engine, which provides the user with a text-based answer at the top of the page to save them from sifting through web results to find the information they need. Alphabet's AI initiatives are resonating with investors, who have catapulted the company into the exclusive $2 trillion club this year.\n\n5. Amazon: 3.7% of the S&P 500\n\nAmazon is best known as an e-commerce company, and online sales remain its largest source of revenue. But the company has branched out into streaming, digital advertising, robotics, and cloud computing (among other things), which have all contributed to the company's position on this list. In fact, its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the biggest in the industry, and it's home to a growing number of AI services.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy wants AWS to dominate the three layers of AI. There is the infrastructure layer, the model layer, and the application layer. To achieve this, the company now designs its own AI chips for the data center, it offers a growing portfolio of ready-made large language models (LLMs), including some it developed in-house, and it recently launched a generative AI assistant called Q, which can help businesses extract more value from the AWS platform.\n\nAmazon also uses AI in its core e-commerce platform to recommend products to customers and to help advertisers craft engaging content. Simply put, this is one of the most diversified companies an investor can own during the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest five-year agreement between Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and FWD Group Holdings Limited (“FWD”). The agreement is the extension of the latter’s cloud technology collaboration with AWS.\r\n\r\nThis highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.\r\n\r\nPer the agreement, AWS has become the strategic cloud provider of insurance company FWD. In order to support its cloud-first strategy, FWD intends to leverage AWS’s cloud computing capabilities, agility and scalability.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS’s customer base.\r\n\r\nAWS’s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Brightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter’s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\n\nWe believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS’s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\n(NOTE: This article is being reissued to correct an error.

        "title": "Amazon, Walmart, and Target finally realize their colossal pricing mistake—now they’re slashing costs to win back customers",
        "content": "Amazon Fresh just became the latest big-box retailer to cut costs on thousands of items, following in the footsteps of Walmart and Target in reversing course on years of inflation-induced price hikes in a bid to lure back disgruntled customers.\n\nThe company’s Amazon Fresh subsidiary announced Thursday it will slash the costs of 4,000 weekly rotating grocery products by up to 30%. The discounts will apply to both national and Amazon’s store brands.\n\n“Increasing our Weekly Deals across thousands of items and expanding the reach of Prime Savings at Amazon Fresh is just one way that we’re continuing to invest in competitive pricing and savings for all of our customers—both in-store and online,” Amazon Fresh worldwide vice president Claire Peters said in a statement.\n\nLast week saw an onslaught of retailers offering discounts on essential items: Target made a similar promise as Amazon's, saying it would cut the prices of 5,000 items including diapers and pet food. The retailer rolled out its “dealworthy” discount brand in February, introducing 400 household and essential products mostly under $10. Walmart also said it would lower costs of 7,000 items, a 45% increase in price rollbacks. Aldi and Kroger both made moves to lower grocery prices as well.\n\nThese price cuts come after persistent inflation raised the cost of groceries 1.1% year over year as of April. That’s down 0.1% from March and significantly less than the 4.1% year-over-year price increase for food from restaurants, leaving retailers with an opportunity to take advantage on consumers’ increased reliance on groceries.\n\n“We’re going to lead on price, and we’re going to manage our [profit] margins, and we’re going to be the Walmart that we’ve always been,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told analysts this month.\n\nRetailers feel the pressure\n\nBig-box stores lowering prices wasn’t an altruistic move to throw customers a bone during tough times. Retailers have suffered from weak sales due to customers’ struggle with high prices. Target reported a 3.1% drop in net sales from a year ago and a 3.7% quarterly dip in comparable sales, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of declines. Though Walmart has continued to soar, it owes much of its 6% revenue growth to its e-commerce successes and wealthy customer base, the latter of which makes up a growing chunk of its audience.\n\nThis trend has continued in fast food, with McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King all announcing meal deals following earnings reports that suggest customers are losing their taste for high-priced fast food, including $18 Big Mac meals and threats of surge pricing.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, retailers’ decision to hike prices in the first place can’t all be attributed to inflation, Lindsay Owens, executive director of economic policy group Groundwork Collaborative, argued. She told the Washington Post that companies actually increased their margins in times of increased operating costs. A March 2024 Federal Trade Commission report found retail revenue for food and beverages increased 7% above total costs in the first three quarters of 2023, indicating that grocery stores’ decision to raise prices wasn’t just a result of inflation, supply-chain disruptions, or the rising prices of commodities.\n\n“What you see is that’s effectively made possible by companies who are passing along their rising costs in full but then going for more,” Owens said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Innovative Tech Stocks Ready for 100% Gains in 5 Years",
        "content": "The tech sector is well-known for innovation. Indeed, most investors who want growth focus on names in the software, subscriptions and services areas of the tech market. Recurring revenue streams and pricing power are among the key facets that make the Magnificent 7 stocks so intriguing. These companies have been able to maintain sky-high margins for a very long time, with no end in sight.\n\nThe thing is, picking mid-tier companies that could vie for a similar position one day is where the real money lies. Of course, finding the next tech superstar isn’t easy, and it’s what every investor is trying to do.\n\nThat said, it’s my view that investors simply need to follow the innovation in the tech space, and returns should generally follow. Consumers will reward companies that provide excess value, and those companies should reward investors over time. Here are three innovative tech stocks I think fit that bill right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom Video (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving its best years during the pandemic, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) has seen immense growth and popularity for the simple reason that more folks are working from home than ever. The company’s offerings were in the right place at the right time, with virtual meetings and work-from-home video setups becoming commonplace. Unsurprisingly, the company’s revenue spiked during 2021 and 2022, and has come back down to earth somewhat since then.\n\nThat said, the company isn’t sitting on its hands. There’s plenty of competition building in this space from the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), who are expanding their video conferencing platforms, while Zoom has faced some challenges.\n\nAlthough Zoom saw a 3% increase in 2024, its aggressive cost-cutting strategies boosted its EPS by 16%. Moreover, the company started a buyback program worth $1.5 billion and repurchased $150 million shares in Q1 2025.\n\nDuring Q1 2025, Zoom exceeded estimates by 1.2% and EPS by 13.5%. Revenue sat at $1.14 billion, surpassing the $10 million projection. Moreover, adjusted earnings rose $1.35 per share, while projections only anticipated $0.16. The company also projects a 3.4% average annual revenue growth until 2027.\n\nIf Zoom can continue to grow profitably and focus on innovation for its core suite, this is a stock that could see growth accelerate in the years to come.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) logo on a smartphone which is next to a miniature shopping cart and miniature cardboard boxes\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the biggest e-commerce platform providers in the world, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has seen impeccable revenue growth and profitability in recent quarters. This most recent quarter saw the company bring in revenue of $1.9 billion and turnaround free cash flow to $232 million. The company also expects low growth for Q1 2025, but this doesn’t put away the fact that Shopify is a growth stock to own and hold for the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify’s stock exhibits high volatility, with 18 significant moves over the past year. The stock’s most recent movement suggests the market deems the news noteworthy but not altering the business perception. Despite Q2’s anticipated high-teens revenue growth, narrower-than-usual beats on GMV and revenue raised concerns. However, the company’s earnings per share have surpassed expectations, and improved gross margin and positive cash flow were positive highlights amidst mixed results.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe AI sector’s bullish momentum remains strong, with projections estimating a $15.7 trillion contribution to the global economy by 2030. Key players like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have dominated early gains, but investors seek emerging companies like Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) for AI exposure.\n\nOracle maintained consistent growth, with revenue increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.92% over the past five years. In its latest fiscal Q3, revenue surged by 7% to $13.3 billion, driven by a 12% yearly rise in its core cloud services and license support business, accounting for over 75% of total revenues. EPS rose by 16% to $1.41, surpassing estimates for the fifth consecutive quarter, with remaining performance obligations increasing by 29% to $80 billion.\n\nTeam IM, an Oracle data center partner, is set to launch its sovereign cloud services in New Zealand on August 1st. Director Ian Rogers reported that all hardware is in place, and the Team Cloud project is running about two weeks ahead of schedule. The company aims to be the first hyperscaler to launch locally, with preparations also underway for a second region in Auckland North. Oracle executives are expected to attend the launch event on July 23rd.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Wayfair W is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the home goods market. Per an EMR report, the global furniture and home goods market size is expected to hit $914.10 billion by 2032, indicating a CAGR of 5.2% during the forecast period of 2024-2032.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company recently inaugurated its first in-person large-format store in Wilmette, IL, providing a one-stop destination for all home goods, including furniture, home decor, housewares, appliances and home improvement products.\r\n\r\nThe store features 19 departments offering expert onsite design services and fast delivery, enabling customers to purchase curated collections for their homes.\r\n\r\nThis offline store has increased Wayfair’s physical footprint. In this way, the company further aims to expand its reach to a wider customer base, opting for offline shopping in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, will likely bolster Wayfair’s overall customer base.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company’s active customers grew 2.8% year over year to 22.3 million.\n\nWayfair Inc. Price and Consensus Wayfair Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nWayfair Inc. price-consensus-chart | Wayfair Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Efforts in Home Goods Market\n\nWayfair conducted a new brand campaign, \"Welcome to the Wayborhood,\" to inspire customers to create their own unique home expression, regardless of style, space, or budget. The campaign, which includes TV spots and social activations, aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers, showcasing their various styles and personalities. This campaign is expected to increase brand awareness among its customers.\r\n\r\nThe company launched The Montana Collection, expanding its French-country-styled Kelly Clarkson Home line’s offerings.\r\n\r\nThe Montana Collection, inspired by Wayfair’s official brand ambassador, Kelly Clarkson’s ranch home in Montana, features the star’s self-curated collection of vintage-inspired furniture and décor pieces.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned initiatives are expected to strengthen Wayfair’s footprint in the home goods market, which, in turn, will likely aid its overall financial performance in the upcoming period.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $12.14 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 1.2%.\n\nStiff Competition\n\nHowever, intensifying competition in the home goods market from major players like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY remains a risk. Wayfair’s shares have lost 0.8% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector’s 9.3% growth. Its shares have underperformed both Amazon and eBay.\r\n\r\nAmazon enjoys a strong momentum in the home goods market on the back of its Amazon Home offerings, which include home decor products, furniture, home appliances and a range of home improvement goods like lighting and bed and bath materials. The company is also gaining from a robust smart home devices portfolio, which includes smart home security cameras, video doorbells, and mesh home Wi-Fi systems, among others.\r\n\r\nAMZN shares have gained 19% on a year-to-date basis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, eBay offers a variety of home décor products, including clocks, floral décor, vinyl art, sculptures and figurines, to name a few. The company also offers customers a wide range of household supplies and cleaning products, kitchen fixtures, holiday and seasonal décor, lamps, lighting and ceiling fans, and bedding & bath products, thereby bolstering its presence in the home goods space.\r\n\r\nEBAY has returned 25.4% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Wayfair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the retail-wholesale sector is Coupang CPNG, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\n\nAMZN sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Value Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Internet - Commerce industry's P/E of 21.3X, shares of Amazon are trading at a forward P/E of 39.2X. AMZN also has a PEG Ratio of 1.3, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 23.9X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 3.2X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. 12 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.52 to $4.61 per share. AMZN has an average earnings surprise of 48.2%.\n\nInvestors should take the time to consider AMZN for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings and valuation metrics, and impressive Value and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned -0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.61 points to a change of +59% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +14.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +25.9% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMZN _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. The $638.24 billion and $709.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Walmart, Target and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 28, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Amazon AMZN.\n\nRetail Earnings & Consumer Spending: A Closer Look\n\nThe U.S. economy is chugging along, with the growth pace moderately decelerating under the weight of the Fed's tight monetary policy.\n\nMany in the market had hoped that at the start of the year, the central bank would have started easing by now. But then inflation readings started misbehaving in the first few months of the year, changing this Fed outlook as a result. The expectation is still for one to two rate cuts this year, but there isn't a lot of conviction in this outlook.\n\nThe timing of the first Fed rate cut is a huge preoccupation for stock market investors. However, with the unemployment rate at a multi-decade low, household buying power remains largely intact, even though most of the Covid savings have already been used up. And that's what we saw in the Q1 earnings season, with consumer spending largely holding up.\n\nWhile household finances in the aggregate are in reasonably good shape, there is stress at the lower end of the income distribution. Notwithstanding the still-plentiful jobs and the steady deceleration in inflation, the cumulative inflationary rise has exceeded the comparable wage gains. One data source shows a roughly +20% cumulative inflationary rise since February 2020, when Covid got underway.\n\nWhile overall spending remains healthy, consumer preferences shifted in the post-Covid period towards services like leisure, entertainment, and travel and less towards 'stuff' like apparel, home goods, and the like.\n\nIt is this shift in consumer preferences that accounts for the performance variance between Walmart and Target. As we noted here before, Target's merchandise leans heavily towards discretionary categories that aren't a priority for consumers at present. On the other hand, Walmart has a vast grocery business and has been attracting an ever-growing share on higher income households attracted to the company's convenient pick-up and delivery offerings.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 28 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor's standard industry classification.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 28 retailers that have reported are up +32% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThese companies have been finding it hard to beat estimates.\n\nWith respect to earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group's performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 28 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon's Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution. One can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week's Earnings Reports\n\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 481 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 24th. We have almost 100 companies reporting results this week, including 10 S&P 500 members. This week's line-up includes more retailers like Best Buy, Ulta, Dollar General, and Tech players like Salesforce, HP, and others.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 81 index members are up +7% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nWe have been flagging an acceleration in the earnings growth trend, which becomes more apparent once the Bristol Myers drag is removed from the data; the pharma giant came out with a huge one-time charge.\n\nEarnings growth for these companies would have been +10% instead of +7% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.\n\nAs we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been on the weaker side for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.8% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.9% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -0.7%, while the growth pace improves to +9.7% on an ex-energy basis.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9% on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nThe revisions trend has been very favorable for Q2 estimates.\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% on +1.6% revenue growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Where is Earnings Growth Coming From?\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "3 Sorry Big Data Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can",
        "content": "Thinking about Big Data stocks to sell might not be the most popular move right now. Especially when we consider the impact of Big Data in artificial intelligence (AI), the thought of offloading Big Data stocks becomes doubly difficult.\n\nHowever, the truth is that the AI hype train picked up quite a few unwanted passengers along the way. The slightest mention of AI led to rapid stock market activity last year but market experts expect things to change, predicting a broader market in the near future. Moreover, while some Big Data companies are genuinely leveraging AI effectively, others lag behind, diluting shareholder value in the face of intense competition. With that in mind, it becomes imperative for investors to filter out the noise and dump these stocks to sell offering little upside ahead.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) Bitcoin BTC representation coin with MicroStrategy (MSTR) text in background.\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), traditionally a software company, has shifted its focus these days as a leading Bitcoin (BTC-USD) holding entity. CEO Michael Saylor has been a vocal advocate for the crypto bellwether, leveraging MSTR’s balance sheet by issuing debt to load up on more BTC. With BTC’s bull run in the past year or so, we’ve seen MSTR stock gain an eye-popping 492% in 2023. Moreover, it has kept up the momentum this year, with year-to-date (YTD) gains exceeding 167%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNeedless to say, MSTR is one of the most overheated stocks on the market, trading upwards of 60 times forward sales estimates. Its top brass has placed it in an incredibly precarious situation in the event of a major BTC pullback. This all-in approach may pay off remarkably when all is awesome with the crypto market. However, given the volatility in the crypto and blockchain space, it is perilous to be as recklessly courageous as MSTR’s management.\n\nVeritone (VERI) Chatbot conversation Ai Artificial Intelligence technology online customer service. Digital chatbot, robot application, OpenAI generate. financial investment stock market. Virtual assistant on internet. AI stocks\n\nSource: khunkornStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ:VERI) has been playing the AI game long before it became the hottest trend last year. It operates an AI-powered platform that helps businesses optimize their data for more effective decision-making. Like many of its peers, Veritone rode the AI wave, boasting a stellar YTD surge of over 69%. Most of those gains were achieved during March and April when its stock shot up from under $2 to $7.76 per share. My fellow InvestorPlace colleague Thomas Niel talked about the run-up in a recent article, pointing out that a short squeeze mainly drove the rally.\n\nHowever, VERI stock hasn’t given its shareholders much to cheer about lately besides the short squeeze. Its business relies heavily on just one client, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which introduces a dangerous level of customer risk. Moreover, revenue growth has mostly been negative in recent quarters, with it making virtually zero progress in turning a profit. Hence, investors must tread carefully with the stock, especially with the potential for a massive sales decline if Amazon further reduces its engagement.\n\nStory continues\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecurity\n\nSource: Song_about_summer / Shutterstock\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) operates a robust data management platform catering to over 100,000 customers. It benefits from the growing cybersecurity threats and digital transformation, driving demand for powerful data protection solutions. Consequently, it has enjoyed a healthy run-up in value over the past few years, gaining more than 60% in the past year. It now trades at more than 24 times forward cash flow estimates, with many questioning whether the tailwinds propelling the stock are fully priced-in. Moreover, Wall-Street analysts expect an 18% downside in its stock from current levels.\n\nFurthermore, the waters are getting choppier for the company with the competition nipping at its heels. Companies like Veeam and Rubrik could take away considerable market share as they gear up for IPOs that could inject new capital and strength into their businesses. Additionally, CommVault is heavily dependent on its partnership with Arrow, accounting for a significant 35% of its revenue base. Hence, with the cybersecurity landscape getting more crowded, price wars and the constant need for innovation could strain CommVault’s resources.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Recommends This Index Fund. It Could Turn $350 Per Month Into $903,800, With Help From AI Stocks.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett turned Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through a litany of shrewd investments. In fact, its stock price has skyrocketed more than 4,300,000% since he took control in 1965. That accomplishment has made Buffett one of the most revered figures in the financial world.\n\nSurprisingly, Buffett has never recommended Berkshire stock. Instead, he has regularly advised investors to periodically purchase shares of an index fund that tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). That strategy provides diversified exposure to hundreds of American businesses that are collectively \"bound to do well\" over time, according to Buffett.\n\nIndeed, history says investors can build an $903,800 portfolio over three decades by simply investing $350 per month in an S&P 500 index fund. Here's how.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides diversified exposure to hundreds of U.S. companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) measures the performance of 500 U.S. companies, a blend of value stocks and growth stocks from every market sector. The index fund covers about 80% of U.S. equities and nearly 50% of global equities by market capitalization, meaning it spreads money across many of the most influential companies in the world.\n\nOne tailwind that should send the S&P 500 higher in future years is artificial intelligence (AI). Just as e-commerce, mobile connectivity, and cloud computing drove the index higher in past years, many experts see AI as the next generation-defining investment theme. Indeed, the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (shown in the chart) are all well positioned to monetize AI in the future. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to hundreds of stocks that could benefit from artificial intelligence, including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nHere's a look at each company.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is the largest enterprise software vendor and the second-largest cloud computing provider. The company is monetizing artificial intelligence with generative AI Copilots for its software products, and cloud AI services. Most notably, Microsoft Azure lets developers build generative AI applications with large language models from ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has cultivated brand authority across several consumer electronics verticals, and it has a particularly strong market presence in smartphones. The company undoubtedly lags its big tech peers in monetizing artificial intelligence, but upcoming versions of iOS will reportedly feature AI-powered search, summaries, photo editing, and other automations.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) offer unparalleled performance when accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence applications. The company holds more than 80% market share in AI chips, and its extensive product ecosystem -- spanning hardware, software, and services -- makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for building entire AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the market leader in digital advertising and the third-largest cloud computing provider, and it's leaning into artificial intelligence across both product categories with its Gemini model. Specifically, Gemini simplifies ad campaign creation with natural language, supports the development of generative AI applications, and automates work in its office productivity suite Google Workspace.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) enjoys a leadership position in e-commerce, retail advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is using artificial intelligence across all three product categories. Rufus is an AI-powered shopping assistant, Amazon Ads offers generative AI for creating brand images, and Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service for developing generative AI applications.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 is a cheap, easy way to build wealth\n\nThe S&P 500 is a proven moneymaker. The index outperformed virtually every other asset class over the last two decades, from international equities and fixed income to real estate and precious metals, and it has been a profitable investment over every 20-year period in history.\n\nThe S&P 500 returned 1,970% over the last 30 years, compounding at 10.62% annually. At that pace, $350 invested monthly would be worth $74,200 in one decade, $288,100 in two decades, and $903,800 in three decades. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but even a more conservative growth rate of 10% annually would turn $350 invested monthly into $791,000 over three decades.\n\nWarren Buffett believes \"American business -- and consequently a basket of stocks -- is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.\" His logic is simple: The U.S. is the largest and arguably the most innovative economy in the world. Indeed, 16 of the 20 largest companies in the world are U.S. companies, and the U.S. stock market is by far the largest.\n\nThat makes a compelling argument for investing in U.S. stocks, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is essentially a basket of the most successful U.S. companies. Additionally, with an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning the annual fees will total $3 for every $10,000 invested, the index fund is a cheap and easy way to build wealth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "If You Can Only Buy One S&amp;P 500 Stock in May, It Better Be One of These 7 Names",
        "content": "A handful of top S&P 500 stocks to buy tend to take the spotlight, many with good reason. Still, companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) comprise an increasingly high position in the index’s overall ranking and that is reasonable cause for concern for those prioritizing effective diversification planning.\n\nAt the same time, plenty of stinkers exist among S&P 500 stocks, making broad-based index investing less than ideal. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are each down nearly 40% since January alone, with indications that each (and others) is facing further pain ahead.\n\nThat’s why focusing your S&P 500 stocks to buy selection on a handful of well-known names near the top coupled with diversified, lesser-known winners in the middle is a surefire way to create an alternate series of S&P 500 investments — without the relative overweight of a select few companies, while simultaneously cutting out some dead wood.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an easy pick for a list of top S&P 500 stocks to buy. Well-loved, pervasive, and continually expanding, Amazon’s wide-ranging offerings and cultural innovation ensure that the company will remain a staple in our lives for the foreseeable future — not to mention part of our collective investment portfolios.\n\nWhile Amazon’s ongoing retail efforts impact consumers and are noteworthy in their own right, Amazon’s potential as a long-term player among S&P 500 stocks is its cloud service segment. As more companies pivot to remote models or try to save hardware costs by relying on cloud data storage, Amazon’s web services are becoming a key part of many other business models and operations. That’s why Amazon’s recent $25 billion quarterly sales stat is huge news — Amazon is on track to secure $100 billion from its web service segment alone, setting up a perpetual cash flow machine as network switching costs tend to be high and existing clients stick with what they know.\n\nDeere & Co (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) is one of my favorite S&P 500 stocks to buy. But it’s in an unlikely category: robotics and automation. While robotics and automation are hot topics, Deere tends to go under-appreciated in a wider market that favors startups and more niche offerings. That’s a mistake because—once Deere unveils the full scope and extent of its robotics offerings—the company could quickly become one of the top robotics stocks in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeere’s flagship offerings in the category include fully autonomous tractors and tillage machines, which leverage advanced mapping and sensing tech to save agricultural producers time and energy when it comes to prepping fields or harvesting.\n\nAnd, while the autonomous tractors have clear and viable operational prospects today, Deere could see big money coming down the pipe in the future as part of licensing agreements to leverage its newly developed tech.\n\nFor example, self-driving car companies could license portions of Deer’s neural network sensing mechanisms that determine if the area is safe to drive over or not, or drone delivery startups could license Deer’s mapping tools to build a city delivery overlay.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a powerhouse among S&P 500 stocks to buy, seamlessly integrating innovative technology, robotics, and the global growth trajectory of healthcare. As a key player in both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is undeniably stable and increasingly relied upon as a provider of high-end, specialized medical equipment.\n\nUnlike competitors focused on conventional medical hardware, Intuitive Surgical revolutionizes surgery to enhance provider efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nThe company is expanding aggressively worldwide as the healthcare industry continues its post-pandemic rebound. The latest quarterly report highlighted a significant 16% year-over-year increase in the global use of its premier robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, and a consistent installation rate (312 units installed in Q1 2023 and 313 units installed this year).\n\nThis progress, coupled with an 11% sales increase and a rise in net income to $545 million from $355 million, solidifies Intuitive Surgical’s position as one of today’s top stocks to buy.\n\nKeep an eye on Intuitive Surgical this year as the company unveils its next-generation da Vinci platform. According to CEO Gary Guthart, this new model will boast “10,000 times the processing power” of current versions, significantly enhancing data analysis, sensing technology, and overall digital and analytical functions.\n\nVICI Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nVICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) owns and partially operates multiple famous Las Vegas properties, including Caesar’s Palace, the Venetian, and MGM Grand.\n\nThis impressive portfolio alone makes VICI worth considering, as Vegas will unlikely lose its global appeal anytime soon. The REIT entered the public market relatively recently, in 2017, following Caesars Entertainment’s (NASDAQ:CZR) bankruptcy proceedings. While Caesars Entertainment still operates Caesars Palace, VICI owns the land and property itself, creating a self-sustaining flywheel that effectively transfers cash from gamblers’ pockets into VICI’s with minimal disruption in the middle.\n\nSince its IPO, VICI’s stock has returned 60%, with gross returns exceeding 120% when factoring in dividends. VICI has maintained a solid 5%+ dividend over the past seven years, with its current 12-month trailing yield at 5.78%. This competitive yield beats most high-yield savings accounts today while the stock itself offers plenty of room to run — in other words, typifying the best long-term S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nI think Elon Musk, love him or hate him, remains a once-in-a-generation business magnate and eternal innovator. That’s why, despite recent challenges, I see buying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at today’s prices as one of the best long-term investment opportunities among all S&P 500 stocks.\n\nMoreover, the company’s current prospects are better than many suggest. While car sales have slumped, this reflects the broader economic landscape rather than Tesla’s potential. Additionally, Tesla is maturing and diversifying its revenue streams, similar to legacy automakers and their cash flow-generating machines.\n\nIn its most recent filing, Tesla posted a 25% increase in services and a 7% rise in energy generation and storage sales. Although these top-line increases often go unnoticed, they are crucial. As Tesla’s market matures, early forays into alternative revenue streams will be essential for its long-term positioning.\n\nFinally, Musk’s promises of developing artificial intelligence and robotics within the wider Tesla ecosystem have real potential. It may take another decade to realize those gains, much like Tesla’s stock over the past ten years, but the long-term prospects are promising.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is often top-of-mind when mentioning tech stocks to buy, and for good reason. The company’s pervasive operational arms touch most of us daily, fostering a culture of growth and innovation. Fortunately for long-term buyers, the current per-share pricing is discounted after shares slid due to management’s spending breakdown and a muted sales forecast, despite a 117% increase in quarterly net income. Meta’s performance indicators were stellar for the first quarter of 2024, with highlights including higher daily active user rates, improved ad impressions, increased ad spending, and over $15 billion returned to shareholders. Despite this, the stock dropped dramatically — but don’t let that dissuade you.\n\nMuch of the short-term turbulence came from higher cost projections, which is actually a positive sign. A planned record-high series of capital expenditures, primarily focused on enhancing Meta’s artificial intelligence capabilities, weighed on investors’ minds. Zuckerberg noted that this would “grow [Meta’s] investment envelope meaningfully before [it makes] much revenue from some of these new products.”\n\nWhile some may view Zuckerberg’s varied metaverse initiatives as a historical pre-play for Meta’s AI prospects, it’s important to consider the company’s long history of forward-thinking projections that take time to bear fruit. Given Meta’s track record, this temporary dip presents a compelling opportunity among S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is last on the list of S&P 500 stocks to buy. Unlike Google (NASDAQ: GOOG, NASDAQ: GOOGL), it offers institutional and individual investors smart money management, significant long-term upside, and forward-thinking management that continues to innovate despite the company’s size.\n\nMicrosoft’s strategic positioning within the AI sector will likely benefit the company significantly in the future. Even if you’re skeptical of some of the more extravagant AI claims, it’s clear that AI threatens legacy search engines while offering new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft’s existing software suite. Microsoft’s investment in leading AI firm OpenAI gives it a front-row seat and a strong position to capitalize on the next big technological advancements.\n\nWe find ourselves in a position similar to the early 2000s, when the potential of search engine technology was just emerging, and no one fully grasped its future profitability. No public company is as well-aligned with that future potential as Microsoft, and its role in doing so aligns itself well with nearly every prudent investment strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Skyrocket in a Massive Gamma Short Squeeze",
        "content": "Short-squeeze stocks have seen an explosion in interest after the recent Roaring Kitty saga that sent many meme stocks soaring to dizzying heights. Now, before we dive in, I would like to mention that meme stocks are something that are generally best avoided, like the plague.\n\nYes, certain meme stocks did surge, but the chance of actually timing any sort of investment correctly is slim to none. Not only that, but most of the mania is short-lived. Thus, you would have to sell at the precise right time to make the most of any rally. And that’s a near-impossible feat for retail investors. In fact, retail investors lost billions in just the past week alone as meme stocks came crashing back down to earth.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean you should avoid short-squeeze plays altogether. In my opinion, you can make some sensible bets that aren’t excessively high-risk and provide some asymmetric upside. These stocks are still risky, but at least they aren’t perpetually decline. Furthermore, it’s possible their underlying businesses can likely survive even if a short squeeze doesn’t materialize. Here are three such short-squeeze stocks to consider right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUpstart (UPST) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. fintech company Upstart Network Inc. (UPST) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpstart’s (NASDAQ:UPST) recent Q1 results show the company is navigating current economic challenges with foresight and flexibility. While revenue of $127.8 million was $2.71 million above estimates (and rose 24.2% year-over-year), the company’s earnings per share also beat estimates by 20%. Still, consumers are simply borrowing less, and it’s having a big impact on Upstart. Banks are a lot more cautious when partnering up with Upstart, as they’d rather play it safe than experiment with AI technology. That said, I see a bright future ahead once interest rate cuts begin, and lending volume increases. UPST EPS estimates. Short-squeeze stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI’m encouraged by the steps management is proactively taking to cut costs responsibly, including reducing annual personnel expenses by $20 million and computing costs by 23%.\n\nThe launch of personal loans secured by automobiles in seven states should help more qualified borrowers access loans at lower rates. With ASPL rates 20% lower on average than alternatives, this product seems well-positioned to meet the affordability needs of consumers. Plus, funding is improving on Upstart’s platform for banks, credit unions, and other financial backers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, with consumer credit risk and interest rates remaining high for now, loan volumes will likely stay restrained in the short term. Upstart is wisely scaling back non-research uses of its own funds for new loans during this period of uncertainty. I think it is only a matter of time before UPST stock heads higher once interest rate cuts start. Some big quarterly beats should cause a short squeeze, considering the stock’s current short interest sits at 32.2%. This is definitely one of the top short-squeeze stocks to buy, in my books.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has been one of the worst-performing stocks in the market this year, and over a longer-term time horizon. The Roomba company is down 94% from its peak, but I see promising trends emerging. T\n\nhe company’s Q1 results exceeded what analysts had predicted. Total revenue of $150 million surpassed estimates by over $5 million, though sales were still 6.4% lower than the previous year. The company’s aggressive restructuring efforts seem to be paying off, with operating losses shrinking to $40 million. Notably, iRobot also beat earnings per share estimates by nearly 24%. If this number continues to improve faster than analysts think, the upside potential with IRBT stock could be huge. IRBT short-squeeze stocks. IRBT EPS estimates.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThose who have bet against the stock might be in trouble. The company is getting $94 million in termination fees from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This alone is nearly a third of IRBT’s entire market cap.\n\nFurthermore, the short interest in this name is above 30%, so any positive news could trigger a rush by short sellers to cover their bets. The appointment of turnaround expert Gary Cohen as the new CEO may provide that catalyst.\n\nRegardless, iRobot still faces strong headwinds. Gross profit margins of 24.6% remain squeezed due to intense competition and weaker consumer spending on home appliances. While management is wisely focusing on cost-cutting, making operations more efficient, and participating in the more affordable product segment, a true recovery will depend on growth resuming on the top line. When that will happen remains uncertain, hence the high short interest.\n\nGuess? (GES) the interior of a crowded shopping mall\n\nSource: jayk67 / Shutterstock.com\n\nGuess? (NYSE:GES) is among the most aggressively-shorted stocks in the market right now. The company sports a short interest ratio of 32.4%, which is quite surprising since this company just had an incredible quarter. Additionally, I believe the company’s stock could climb much higher.\n\nRevenues grew 9% year-over-year to $891 million, surpassing estimates by more than $36 million. Even more impressively, adjusted earnings per share of $2.01 far exceeded expectations by 44 cents.\n\nManagement highlighted that all five of their business divisions increased revenues, with Americas Wholesale, Asia, Licensing, and Europe leading the way. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, Guess? also finished out the year with inventory down a healthy 9%.\n\nWith the stock still trading at a reasonable price relative to earnings, the exceptional results of the fourth quarter sets the stage for a potential short squeeze. If this momentum continues, those who have bet against the stock may feel forced to cover their positions.\n\nThe company’s recently-announced special dividend of $2.25 per share simply adds another catalyst to the list. Currently, GES stock provides a dividend yield of 4.84%, and unsurprisingly, analysts are bullish on this name.

        "title": "Income Icons: 3 Ultra-High Yield Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Investors should never chase yield. Buying a dividend stock simply because it offers significantly higher-than-average yields will only set you up for problems. That’s because high-yield stocks often have problems. You can see why this is by looking at how yield is calculated.\n\nTo find a dividend stock’s yield, you divide the amount of dividends per share a company pays by the stock’s price per share. So, if a stock’s price falls the yield rises. And of course, if a stock’s price is falling there could be something wrong with the business.\n\nBut not all ultra-high yield stocks are broken business. Sometimes perfectly healthy companies offer a dividend that results in rising rates. Or it is simply the nature of the industry. Real estate investment trusts (REIT), for example, are required to pay out almost all of their profits as dividends, so they tend to offer above-average yields.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three ultra-high-yield stocks that fit that mold. Their businesses are sound, but the yields offered are lucrative. You may want to buy their stocks by the handful.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (EPD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nMidstream oil and gas industry operator Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is the premier transportation, storage and exporter of oil, gas and natural gas liquids (NGL), where it is the dominant player. It operates under long-term contracts, with its customers and gets paid regardless of whether the customer takes possession of the product or uses the requested capacity.\n\nIt is the NGL business that is the linchpin to future growth. Enterprise Products saw an opportunity early on and developed an extensive export infrastructure. Because oil and gas companies utilize advanced drilling techniques, they reached previously unattainable reserves. That made the U.S. the world’s top exporter of liquid natural gas (LNG) in 2023. Although LNG and NGL are different things, NGLs could be hurt by the Biden administration’s “pause” on LNG exports to non-free trade countries nonetheless.\n\nBecause most of the export market is to such locations it could impede natural gas production in the U.S. And since NGLs are a byproduct of natural gas production — as much as 90% of NGLs come from natural gas — exporters could be collateral damage.\n\nYet, global demand for NGLs will continue to grow. With the U.S. as the premier source for low-cost supply, Enterprise Products Partners is perfectly positioned to capitalize. Its dividend yields 7.3% annually and should support significant capital appreciation to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nAres Capital (ARCC) Ares Capital (ARCC) logo on its webpage\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAres Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC) is the largest, publicly-traded business development company (BDC). It owns over 500 middle-market businesses worth almost $23 billion. Shares are up 7% in 2024 and are just about to hit a new 52-week high. The dividend yields 9% annually.\n\nBDCs are very much like REITs in that they are also required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders. It offers investors a 10-year regular or base dividend per share growth rate exceeding 26% and has enjoyed a 19% total return on its stock.\n\nYet, Ares lags the market due to the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented rate hike policies. It raised interest rates 11 times last year and now shows no interest in lowering them. As inflation remains stubbornly elevated, the high interest rates raise borrowing costs and Ares’ expenses increase.\n\nThe BDC still represents a good long-term play on the American economy growing over time, and its lucrative payout makes it worth waiting until the stock returns to growth.\n\nJPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) Illustration of an ETF in multiple sectors.\n\nSource: SWKStock / Shutterstock\n\nAdmittedly, buying the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) is the riskiest ultra-high-yield stock of the three. It is still worth considering. As an exchange-traded fund (ETF), JEPI owns a basket of top dividend stocks. Its top three holdings are Trane Technologies (NYSE:TT), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its top 10 holdings make up over 15% of the portfolio. The ETF offers a yield of 7.5% and a low expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\nWhat you might notice is that while many of its holdings offer relatively low yields of around 1% some, like Amazon, don’t even pay a dividend. So, how is JEPI such an ultra-high-yield stock?\n\nThat’s because it invests up to 20% of its portfolio into equity-linked notes (ELN), essentially an advanced covered call option. JEPI collects premiums from buyers of those options. So, most of the dividends JEPI pays are from those premiums. That means JEPI will do much better during volatile market periods, which can also push its yield even higher than what it is now. Historically, though, the dividend yield is in the 5% to 8% range. But “historical” is a misnomer, as JEPI has only been around since 2020.\n\nMoreover, ELN income and covered call income can be taxable. It means owning JEPI stock is best suited for tax-free or tax-deferred accounts. This ultra-high-yield stock may be best for those about to retire or are retired and looking for immediate dividend income — or in the next few years.\n\nThe JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF is not for everyone but does have its place in some investor’s portfolios.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "With the world fighting to go green, it just makes sense to invest in renewable energy stocks to buy.\n\nLook at First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR). In early April, I highlighted an opportunity in the solar stock, as it traded at around $163. Today, it’s up to around $277.\n\nAll thanks to the news that it is well-positioned to benefit from rising electricity demand from artificial intelligence giants looking for clean power for their data centers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, according to CNBC:\n\n“AI uses 10 times more electricity than traditional Google search, according to UBS. As electricity demand from AI grows, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google unit has committed to buying renewable power that matches their consumption.”\n\nThat news alone could send FSLR to higher highs.\n\nOr, look at Cameco (NYSE:CCJ), which is still benefiting from surging uranium demand. Since bottoming out in March at around $39, it’s now up to $53. Even copper stocks have been hot with President Biden’s latest tariffs on China, such as Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).\n\nOutside of those three, here are some of top renewable energy stocks to buy and hold.\n\nNexGen Energy (NXE) Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned NexGen Energy (NYSE:NXE), it traded at $7.25 on May 15. After testing a high of $8.14, it pulled back with the broader market. But with the uranium story hotter than ever, with demand outstripping supply, it’s still a solid long-term bet. It’s also benefiting from the news that Congress has prohibited uranium imports from Russia.\n\nAccording to Energy.gov, that ban “brings us one step closer to developing a reliable supply of nuclear fuel that will be required by the United States and its allies to triple nuclear capacity by 2050.” As such, the U.S. government will reportedly ask uranium companies to bid on contracts for about $3.4 billion of domestically produced nuclear reactor fuel.\n\nWe also have to remember the company’s CEO Leigh Curyer “emphasized the growing recognition of nuclear energy and the need for new uranium sources, positioning the Rook I project as a key supplier,” as noted by Investing.com.\n\nSouthern Copper (SCCO) Southern Copper Corporation logo on a phone screen in front of the logo on a computer screen. SCCO stock.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\n\nWe can also jump into the copper rally, which should continue to boost Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO).\n\nSupply-demand issues and new Chinese tariffs sent the mining company higher-to-date. But it could race even higher with AI.\n\nAfter all, copper wires and power cables are essential for electric companies, which are seeing higher demand for energy at AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Gavekal Research analyst Tan Kai Xian said this about what is driving copper highler along with utility stocks:\n\n“The electrification of everything theme, whether it be the replacement of hydrocarbons as a primary fuel source, or the use of power-hungry cloud computing to run all aspects of our economy and lives”\n\nCopper is also seeing a boost for increased demand for renewable energy and electric vehicles, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts. With SCCO, I’d use recent weakness as an opportunity to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nEvery time I talk about renewable energy, I like to add lithium stocks, like Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) to the mix. After all, lithium will see heavy demand, which will have a positive impact on ALB.\n\nRemember, according to Statista, by 2030, global demand for lithium is expected to pass 2.4 metric tons, which doubles the demand forecast for 2025.\n\nBy 2035, they added, demand could reach 3.8 million tons. Then, by 2040, lithium demand could increase 40 times over with expectations for increased EV adoption and energy storage needs.\n\nAlso, while we wait for ALB to push higher, we can collect its yield of 1.25%.\n\nBetter, the company just announced a dividend of 40 cents, which will be payable on July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 14. Adding on to this, analysts at Deutsche Bank just raised their price target on ALB to $140 with a hold rating. RBC Capital also raised its target to $157, with an outperform rating thanks to strong earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Not every machine learning stock is made the same, so it is best to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nTop Machine Learning Stocks: CrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a top-tier cybersecurity firm leveraging machine learning to enhance its robust cybersecurity capabilities.

AWS also said it’s building two new data center sites in Mississippi for $10 billion, the biggest investment in the state’s history.\n\nAmazon has roughly $85 billion in cash.

        "content": "The stock market is showing signs of a comeback with their all-time highs. This is coupled with the market betting on the Fed, which isn’t expected to increase interest rates further. While we cannot predict how high the bull market will go, we can look to the market leaders for overall return. So, let’s look at the top performers from the Dow Jones Industrial Average for stocks to buy during this bull market.\n\nTo get the list, I screened for the following criteria:\n\nTop YTD price percent change, YOY revenue growth should be at least 10%, YOY earnings growth is a minimum of 10%.\n\nThis lets me focus on the companies already performing well in terms of price percentage return and with positive financials that justify their growth. I then arranged the top three from the highest YTD price change to the lowest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Express Company (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmex, which is short for American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), is a globally integrated payments company that offers customers various credit cards to different businesses, corporations, and consumers. American Express has four main operational segments.\n\nUnited States Consumer Services: handles AMEX travel and lifestyle services, including banking and non-card products. Commercial Services: payment and expense management, banking, and non-card financing products. International Card Services: offers travel and lifestyle services to international clients and manages international joint ventures with other businesses. Global Merchant and Network Services: provides marketing and data analytics.\n\nAMEX’s strong brand recognition makes it one of the largest credit card issuers in the world. Its global footprint follows other card providers like Visa, Mastercard, and UnionPay.\n\nAmerican Express reported excellent financials in 2023. Billed business and total revenue grew 9% and 14% YOY, respectively. Net income also saw 11% growth, while diluted EPS increased by 14%. As a result of this top-tier performance, the company announced a 17% increase in quarterly dividends for 2024.\n\n“We delivered record revenues and profits in 2023, building on the momentum we’ve achieved since we announced our growth plan in January 2022,” said Chairman and CEO Stephen J. Squeri.\n\nThe company expects similar growth in 2024, with revenue anticipated to increase by 9% to 11%. This excellent performance is shown in price action.\n\nAs we speak, AXP stock is up 28% YTD. Who knows how high it will get from here?\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe next on the list is part of the magnificent seven stocks that pushed the S&P 500 to all time highs. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a tech behemoth with humble beginnings.\n\nFrom an online marketplace for books to an identity synonymous with online shopping, its ventures are continuously developing, with its latest ventures focusing on AI, cloud computing, digital streaming, and quantum computing. With the strong demand for cloud and the growth of generative AI, Amazon stands at the frontline in the race for the top dog in the tech sector.\n\nAmazon reported 12% YOY higher revenue in 2023. This good news came with another significant increase in operating income, from $12.2 billion to $36.9 billion. Each segment contributed to this growth, with all four (North America, International, AWS, and Consolidated) seeing double-digit increases.\n\nThe company’s profit turnaround is even more exciting, recovering from a $2.7 billion loss in 2022 to a $30.4 billion net income in 2023.\n\n“This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,” said CEO Andy Jassy.\n\nAmazon’s relentless pursuit of growing its business across different industries continues to pay off – so it’s no wonder AMZN stock is up 22% YTD. All this makes Amazon a likely contender if you’re looking for stocks to buy during a bull market.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nGoldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) is a global financial institution that operates in various segments of the financial markets:\n\nAsset & Wealth Management: caters to its client’s assets and product offerings to manage wealth.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Billionaire David Tepper’s Top AI Stock Pick for 2024?",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 2nd on our list of Top 10 AI Stocks for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\n\nBefore analyzing the stock, let's first see David Tepper's latest returns and his investing strategy for 2024.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.\n\nDavid Tepper's Returns\n\nDavid Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.\n\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\n“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper Q1'2024 Stake Value: $690,494,640\n\nBillionaire David Tepper owns a $690 million stake in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as of the end of the first quarter of 2024. Amazon Web Services business has become an AI powerhouse as companies use the Cloud platform to develop, deploy and maintain their AI applications.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw a sharp increase in hedge fund sentiment in the first quarter of 2024. A total of 302 hedge funds out of the 919 funds in Insider Monkey's database now own stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 293 hedge funds in the previous quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant, world class company with powerful secular tailwinds in place including its ecommerce penetration, digital advertising growth, and the cloud transition. Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. Losses in the Core Retail business significantly narrowed. Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per unit basis for the first time since 2018 as the company’s recent regionalization efforts continue to bear fruit.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 2nd on our list of Top 10 AI Stocks for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\n\nClick to see more AI stock picks of billionaire Tepper by clicking 10 Best AI Stock Picks of David Tepper for 2024.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Opportunities in Uranium Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently discussed some of the best artificial intelligence business ideas. While the best business idea for you may depend on your skill set and experience, we curated a list based on opinions from business experts. You can check out our free report on 18 Best AI Business Ideas in 2024.\n\nProminent AI startups: At a Glance\n\nAnthropic, Databricks, and Abridge are among the leading AI startups. Let’s take a look at their offerings and their position in the market. You can also take a look at the biggest publicly traded AI companies in the world.\n\nAnthropic is an artificial intelligence company based in the United States. Dario and Daniela Amodedi represent the company as CEO and president. The company is an AI safety and research company focused on developing safe AI systems. On March 20, Anthropic announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) to develop solutions for enterprises. 1,400 engineers at Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) are being trained to facilitate organizations in fine-tuning Anthropic’s AI models deployed on AWS. Claude, Anthropic’s AI model, is already deployed at the District of Columbia Department of Health. It can create a custom chatbot, also referred to as Knowledge Assist, and is provided through Amazon Bedrock. On March 27, CNBC announced that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was set to invest an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, bringing their total investment to $4 billion. As per Anthropic’s last valuation, the company is valued at $18.4 billion.\n\nDatabricks is another prominent artificial intelligence company based in California, United States. The data analytics company hosts a cloud-based platform that facilitates enterprises in building, deploying, and governing data and AI models. On September 12, 2023, the company announced its series I funding worth $500 million, bringing its valuation to $43 billion and a price per share of $73.50. On March 19, Databricks announced the inclusion of Lilac, a scaleable data search, clustering, and data analysis tool, to evaluate data more easily using AI. Lilac can evaluate the output from large language models to facilitate the preparation of unstructured datasets for model training. The integration will help customers build generative artificial intelligence applications using their own company data.\n\nAbridge, founded in 2018, is a generative artificial intelligence company for clinical conversations. The AI is capable of converting clinical conversations between patients and medical professionals into clinical notes in real-time. Abridge is able to recognize and curate notes in over 14 languages and has more than 50 specialties. On February 23, Reuters reported that Abridge had raised $150 million in a Series C round, bringing its valuation to a staggering $850 million. The funding was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Red Point Ventures. Abridge does not stop here. On March 19, Abridge announced a collaboration with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Abridge will leverage NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) resources and foundational models to deploy generative AI models that improve clinical procedures. With multiple conversations happening in a clinical setting, it is quite challenging to collate all information. Abridge aims to bridge the gap of missing data and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will help the company achieve this objective.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-Backed Business Minds\n\nSamantha North is a blogger who moved from the United Kingdom to Portugal in 2020. On September 12, 2023, Business Insider reported that she made $115,000 in 2022 from her blogging websites. Samantha stated that she uses artificial intelligence to type out her blogs and leverages ChatGPT to extract and test ideas. ChatGPT also helps Samantha analyze her content strategies. She has a dedicated section on AI tools on her website under “AI Mastery.” While she started her AI journey from Jasper, she switched to ChatGPT as Jasper focused more on marketing content. Eventually, she purchased ChatGPT Plus for $20 a month. Samantha now uses Claude 2 since she believes it is easier to use and is very clean and direct. She still uses ChatGPT as she has trained to model to adapt to her tone and voice.\n\nSultan Ali is a 25-year-old based in Pakistan. He is an AI content editor who started his journey when he was using ChatGPT to do his classwork and homework.

        "title": "It's more complicated than ever to watch sports — here's why",
        "content": "Let's say you want to watch the entire upcoming NFL season. You'll need to subscribe to quite a few platforms to even come close.\n\nFor starters, you'll need access to traditional pay-TV channels like Fox (FOXA), CBS (PARA), NBC (CMCSA), and ESPN (DIS). You'll also need to subscribe to over-the-top streaming services including Netflix (NFLX), NBCUniversal's Peacock, Disney's ESPN+, and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN).\n\nAnd if you want to watch games not airing in your local area? Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide.\n\nThe NFL season is just one example of how fragmented the sports landscape has become as legacy media players and more recently tech giants compete for pricey media rights deals. The reason: Sports content is highly desired by media companies looking to gain access to massive audiences of loyal viewers. That allows sports leagues to bid up the price of rights in negotiations.\n\n\"The sports leagues are just taking advantage and trying to get as much as they can,\" Jon Christian, head of digital media supply chain at media consulting company Qvest, told Yahoo Finance. \"They do not want to do just an exclusive deal with one partner. They want to have the diversification.\"\n\nThe MLB has national television contracts with broadcasters including ESPN, Fox, and TBS (WBD). Connected TV platform Roku (ROKU) recently acquired the rights to \"Sunday Leadoff,\" which broadcasts MLB games primarily held on Sunday afternoons.\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA is in deep negotiations for its next media rights package that could fetch up to $75 billion.\n\nThe league's current contract with Warner Bros.' TNT Network and Disney's ESPN expires at the end of next season, although rumors have swirled WBD could lose the media rights to NBCUniversal. Amazon is also in talks for an exclusive streaming deal through Prime Video.\n\nEven college sports have seen increased fragmentation. Just this past week, Warner Bros. secured a handful of College Football Playoff games in a five-year deal with ESPN.\n\n'War of eyeballs' Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) puts up a shot against Indiana Pacers guard T.J. McConnell (9) in overtime of Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe competitive land grab for sports is not all that different from years past. What's changed is the players.\n\nVarious networks within the cable bundle frequently fought over the rights to air certain games, as it helped boost viewership as well as affiliate fees, or fees pay-TV providers give network owners to carry their channels.\n\nThe introduction of streaming massively altered the playing field. Not to mention the deep pockets of Big Tech.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What we have now is still that old model plus this new model, so the fragmentation looks much more severe,\" Christian said, describing the current media landscape as a \"war of eyeballs.\" Additionally, \"there is a lot more revenue to be had in terms of rights because you can separate rights between traditional linear broadcast versus digital and get even more money in that way.\"\n\nTo that point, the industry has seen more à la carte deals with streamers amid the leagues' push for diversification.\n\nNetflix, for instance, will host two Christmas Day NFL games this year as part of a three-season deal with the league. The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSimilarly, Peacock will host one exclusive in-season game after it aired an exclusive wild card playoff game this past season. The platform, which paid a reported $110 million for the rights to the playoff game, saw a significant lift in subscribers as a result.\n\nOn the surface, the moves seem like a win-win for both streamers and sports leagues.\n\nBut the experience might not be so great for consumers. The fragmentation means more money, more subscriptions, and more confusion over when, where, and how to watch.\n\nAmid the chaos, certain leagues have approached media rights differently. Major League Soccer, for example, strategically consolidated all of its rights in order to land an exclusive, one-package deal with Apple (AAPL) in 2022.\n\nThere's also been a rise in streaming bundles as media companies look to consolidate costs, reduce churn, and tilt the power away from Big Tech.\n\n\"These platforms are trying to break down the barriers of use [but] it's not necessarily one bill you're paying,\" Christian said. \"This is where users are going to get frustrated. But if you're a fan of a team or sport, you're going to figure out a way to get it.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Nvidia stock isn't in a massive bubble",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTry to knock this king off the throne.\n\nIn the days since Nvidia's (NVDA) big quarter and outlook on Wednesday night, two tracks have emerged.\n\nTrack one is owned and operated by Wall Street, and it believes Nvidia will continue to speed to new profit heights this year and next. Consensus estimates (which can be tracked on Yahoo Finance here) are on the rise (again), and the Street remains steadfast in its appetite for jacked-up price targets.\n\nThe other track is owned and operated by the media, and it is increasingly looking to poke holes in the Nvidia investment thesis. Hey, I get it; it's our job to be skeptical of numbers, commonly held narratives, and leaders.\n\nBut to be out there peddling that Nvidia's stock is in a bubble because it's up a lot, or its financials may be in a bubble due to eye-popping growth rates, strike me as off base completely.\n\nLet me offer this up front: I have no car in this race — do not own shares of Nvidia and never have.\n\nAll I am saying is that an asset bubble has a few simple characteristics.\n\nOne: The asset appreciating in value usually doesn't have the fundamentals to justify said appreciation. Two: People are blindly buying the asset without understanding the asset — mainly because everyone else is going in.\n\nI don't see either of these things for Nvidia.\n\nInvestors appear very knowledgeable on Nvidia's business and are buying for the correct reasons.\n\nThen, Nvidia's growth rates justify a higher valuation. This is a company that just grew earnings by 461% in the first quarter! Sales exploded 262%!\n\nWhy? Because we are witnessing a seismic shift in tech stacks at the hand of generative AI, powered by models underpinned by Nvidia chips. No one is even close to this company's technology. Concerns over Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) building their own AI chips are great to discuss, but Nvidia is doing this at scale, and is 27 miles ahead of these companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang makes the keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Dan Howley in an exclusive interview right after earnings (video above). \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\n\nWill Nvidia keep growing its top and bottom lines by triple digits? No, but the growth rates will remain beyond impressive and faster than competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBubble? Let's get real here, people!\n\nAmazon AWS has begun to make AI chips to better control a supply chain starved for these powerful pieces of technology. AWS CEO Adam Selipsky discusses the strategy in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast. Listen in below.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Instead of sticking to a broad-based ETF, investors should consider these high-potential names, especially since I predict the AI boom will drive significant advancements in the tech sector for some time to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are seven high-octane tech stocks to buy for this month.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Coinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has benefited from the surge in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company’s return to profitability and the increasing popularity of crypto transactions position it well for future growth.\r\n\r\nCoinbase’s stock price increased by approximately 300%, underscoring its strong position in the digital asset market. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs supports this growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Coinbase reported significant financial improvements with revenue reaching $1.64 billion, up 122% from the same period in 2023, and a net income of $1.18 billion, a stark contrast to the loss reported in the previous year.\r\n\r\nCoinbase’s future outlook remains optimistic. The company forecasts continued institutional investment in Bitcoin and anticipates favorable macroeconomic conditions and regulatory advancements, which are expected to support long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nCOIN is one of my top picks for this year and I think we’ve only started to see the potential of the company.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has demonstrated impressive growth, particularly with a 25% year-over-year (YOY) increase in Q4 revenue, reaching $40.11 billion. The company is focusing on efficiency, scaling back costs, and enhancing AI technologies.\n\nThis strong performance is attributed to a positive shift in ad pricing growth and robust online commerce advertising. The increase in ad pricing marks a return to growth for the first time since Q4 2021, bolstered by significant contributions from China-based advertisers.\r\n\r\nThe company plans to invest $30-37 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, primarily in AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers. This investment is aimed at supporting its long-term AI research and product development efforts. This growth is supported by the successful implementation of cost management strategies and increased monetization efforts through features like Reels and WhatsApp Channels​.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA could be one of those undervalued picks in the stock market for aggressive investors, which is why I recommend it as one to watch.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plays a critical role in the expansion of 5G networks and mobile technology. Despite a recent slowdown in mobile phone sales, the company’s strong position in the 5G market and a robust dividend yield make it an attractive long-term investment​.\r\n\r\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2024, Qualcomm reported strong financial results, with revenues reaching $9.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.44, surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was driven by increased sales in handset and automotive chips. Despite a slight decline in gross margins, the company’s financial performance remains solid.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, Qualcomm has set ambitious growth targets. The company expects its QCT segment to achieve mid-teens compound annual growth rates (CAGR) and maintain operating margins above 30% by fiscal 2024. Additionally, Qualcomm projects automotive revenues to grow to approximately $3.5 billion in five years and $8 billion in ten years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to gain market share in the semiconductor industry with strong performance in its Data Center and Client segments. In the first quarter of 2024, AMD reported revenue of $5.5 billion, marking a 2% YOY increase. The company also achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 52% and a net income of $123 million.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, AMD has set an optimistic outlook for 2024, expecting revenue to reach approximately $5.7 billion in the second quarter, representing a 6% YOY growth. This positive projection is driven by increased demand for its high-performance computing products.\n\nThe company’s focus on edge AI with its Ryzen line positions it well to dominate in this emerging market. CEO Lisa Su has projected the AI accelerator market to reach $400 billion by 2027, nearly 300% growth from this year.\r\n\r\nAMD is a great alternative to the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), as it has a far lower valuation than the microchip giant.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Shopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) remains a leader in e-commerce platforms, with significant revenue growth and recent profitability.\r\n\r\nIn Q4 2023, Shopify reported a 24% increase in revenue, reaching $2.1 billion. The company also achieved a free cash flow of $905 million, compared to a negative free cash flow of $186 million the previous year. This marked a significant turnaround.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Shopify projects revenue growth at a low-twenties percentage rate on a YOY basis. This translates into a mid-to-high-twenties growth rate when adjusted for the impact of selling its logistics businesses. Gross margin for Q1 is on track to increase by approximately 150 basis points compared to Q4 2023.\n\nSHOP is one of my favorite picks for investors seeking one of those high-octane tech stocks for gains. Despite these positive indicators, Shopify’s stock experienced a decline due to lower-than-expected free cash flow guidance for 2024. I still think that long-term SHOP should be on investors’ radars.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoupang (NYSE:CPNG) is expanding into new verticals like travel and dining. Despite a significant drop from its IPO price, analysts forecast strong earnings and revenue growth, with a projected stock price target averaging $26.67, suggesting a potential upside of 19.2% from the current price.\r\n\r\nCoupang’s diversified services include Rocket Fresh for grocery delivery, Coupang Eats for restaurant ordering and delivery, and Coupang Play for online content streaming. These offerings have significantly boosted customer engagement, supported by over 100 fulfillment centers across South Korea.\n\nFinancially, Coupang has consistently reported positive cash flows. In the last four quarters, the company achieved an operating cash flow of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion. This positive financial performance is further highlighted by a 27% YOY increase in gross profits to $1.6 billion.\n\nCPNG could be a good pick for investors who want to diversify their portfolios outside of the United States, as CPNG is essentially the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of South Korea.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), a Chinese EV manufacturer, has shown impressive growth, with revenue increasing by 271% last quarter. It outsold Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in China for October 2023, and its hybrid EVs are gaining significant market share in China. The company delivered 80,400 vehicles in Q1 2024.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company is advancing its autonomous driving technology, with plans to roll out AD Max 3.0, featuring full-scenario autonomous driving capabilities and enhanced safety systems.\n\nFinancially, Li Auto has consistently reported positive cash flows, with Q3 2023 showing a free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The company also achieved a gross profit margin of 25.3% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.9%.\n\nChinese-brand EVs like Li will likely continue to perform strongly, even despite Biden’s recent tariffs on these companies. Asia is fast becoming the hotspot for the market, and I feel that this will continue to grow in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Technology stocks have outperformed the broader market handsomely over the last decade -- illustrated by the fact that the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index clocked a gain of 421% over the period compared to the S&P 500 index's 178% rise. The outperformance isn't surprising. Tech companies tend to benefit from disruptive trends, which allows them to deliver outsized growth.\n\nThe top tech stocks, such as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), have far outpaced even the Nasdaq-100's performance in that timespan, giving long-term investors' portfolios a big boost. NVDA Chart\n\nTo be fair, it would be difficult for Nvidia and Amazon -- now two of the world's largest companies -- to replicate such terrific 10-year gains over the next decade. However, buying these two tech giants and holding on to them as a part of a diversified portfolio has a great chance of being a smart long-term move. Both companies still sit on tremendous growth opportunities in multiple markets, which is why they could become ideal picks for investors looking to grow a million-dollar portfolio.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia has come a long way. Two decades ago, it largely sold graphics processing units (GPUs) for use in gaming personal computers (PCs) and workstations, but today, its hardware (and software) is powering computationally intensive applications in data centers, advanced driver-assistance systems, factories, and digital twin creation, among other areas. Artificial intelligence (AI), however, is currently the biggest catalyst for the company.\n\nNvidia's revenue and earnings grew at a breathtaking pace in recent quarters as customers lined up to get their hands on its AI chips. The company reportedly holds an impressive 92% share of the burgeoning AI chip market, and that dominant presence is expected to keep giving its growth massive shots in the arm: The AI chip market is expected to generate $305 billion in global revenue by 2030 (up from $29 billion in 2022).\n\nNvidia's data center business generated $47.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year; assuming it remains the biggest player in this market at the end of the decade, that figure could be much higher for 2030. This, however, is not the only AI-related opportunity that Nvidia is set to capitalize on.\n\nDemand for PCs capable of running AI software locally is set to increase at an annualized rate of 44% through 2028, according to market research firm Canalys. That impressive growth would ideally lead to stronger demand for the Nvidia GPUs that are deployed in laptops and desktops. As a result, it won't be surprising to see the company's gaming business taking off in the coming years and complementing its data center growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia is gaining traction in the digital twin market. The company's GPUs are being deployed to power the creation of 3D virtual representations of factories before those factories are actually constructed. These digital twins allow organizations to optimize their operations, look for problems, and improve efficiency before the physical factories are built. Such virtual spaces are also useful for a host of purposes after a real-world location is complete.\n\nDemand for digital twins is expected to grow at an annual rate of 41% through 2035, generating annual revenue of $240 billion at the end of the forecast period.\n\nIn all, Nvidia management projects that it is sitting on an addressable market worth a whopping $1 trillion. If that's indeed the case, the company is at the beginning of a terrific growth curve considering that it generated just under $61 billion in revenue last year.\n\nWith numerous lucrative growth opportunities and catalysts, it should keep growing at a nice pace for quite some time. That's why investors looking for tech stocks that could help them grow their portfolios to the million-dollar level should consider buying Nvidia.\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon has benefited from the secular growth of the e-commerce market over the years, and it should continue to capitalize on this segment's growth in the future. According to a forecast by Exactitude Consultancy, the global e-commerce market will clock a compound annual growth rate of 15% through 2030, generating just over $20 trillion in annual revenue at the end of that period.\n\nAmazon is in a solid position to capitalize on this huge growth opportunity as it is the leading e-commerce player in key markets including the U.S., where it has a market share of nearly 40%, a number that has slowly crept higher over the years. However, e-commerce is not the only big growth driver that Amazon is set to make the most of.\n\nThe company is the largest player in the cloud infrastructure services market, with a share of 31% in the first quarter of 2024. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division, reported healthy year-over-year growth of 17% in Q1 and generated $25 billion in revenue. That was higher than the 13% growth in Amazon's overall revenue last quarter to $143.3 billion.\n\nGrowing demand for cloud-based AI services should give AWS a big boost in the long run. Mordor Intelligence estimates that the cloud AI market could generate $274 billion in annual revenue in 2029 as compared to this year's estimate of $67 billion. Amazon's robust share in the cloud computing market and the growing adoption of AI-focused services on AWS suggests that the company is well placed to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nThe growth drivers discussed above tell us why analysts are expecting Amazon's annualized earnings growth to accelerate to 30% for the next five years from 14% in the past five. The company's improved earnings power could lead the market to reward the tech stock over the long run, making it an ideal pick for investors looking to add potential millionaire-maker stocks to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will dissect whether QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the most unstoppable artificial intelligence (AI) stock to buy. We will also take a closer look at the advancements in the artificial intelligence industry. To view more unstoppable AI stocks, check our free report on the 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe Bull Case for AI\n\nOn April 20, Matt Bryson, Wedbush Enterprise Hardware Analyst, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the major players in the AI industry and how interest rate cuts may have little to no impact on the tech wave. Shares of tech stocks including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have been down by 15% over the past 30 days, followed by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping by 10% despite recent highs previously. Despite the pullback in industry activity, Bryson holds a bullish view on artificial intelligence. Bryson highlights the fuel in AI is backed by chip stocks and cloud services providers, lifting NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). He added that despite the pullback, large tech stocks, especially chip makers, will continue investing in AI in 2025 and post strong growth results. Bryson suggests that high interest rates will certainly weigh on consumer spending in the long run, impacting high multiple stocks such as large chipmakers. He then said that interest rates may have little to no impact on the fundamental landscape of technology and AI. According to Bryson, data center operators like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will continue to bet on developing AI applications.\n\nBryson thinks that NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell, a next-gen semiconductor product, will impact the industry positively. While he is certain that AI hardware and software companies will define parameters of success for the industry, he claims it is uncertain to predict the technological developments in AI at the moment. Bryson also holds a bullish view on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and talked about the possibility of companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) developing their own semiconductor products, altering Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited's (NYSE:TSM) position in the market. Bryson said while he expects the industry to grow, it is difficult to predict what sectors AI might penetrate.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome Developments in the AI Space\n\nIn a groundbreaking update, On May 13, OpenAI launched GPT-4o, a platform capable of working across audio, vision, and text in real-time. The new application takes interactions between humans and computers to the next level. The application can provide outputs in response to audio inputs in 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds. While the new product complements GPT-4 Turbo's performance on text in English and code, it is also 50% cheaper and much faster. The tool is also equipped to understand vision and audio inputs easily.\n\nOn May 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched CoPilot + PCs, designed for artificial intelligence. The new PCs are one of the most intelligent and fastest PCs to be ever built. Its new silicon can perform 40-plus trillion operations per second, has a long battery life, and comes with built-in advanced AI models. Individuals in the custody of the new devices will be able to generate and refine images in real-time using Cocreation and function in over 40 languages using the Live Captions tool. The PCs will be made available starting June 18.\n\nWall Street is Bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). On May 22, analyst firm, Wedbush reiterated an Outperform rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and maintained a price target of $500. Based on analyst estimates over the past 3 months, 32 Wall Street analysts held a buy rating on the stock, with an average price target of $491.23 and a high forecast of $600. The stock's average price target has an upside of 11.88% from its current price of $427.25.\n\nNow that we have discussed the latest developments in the AI space, let's take a look at the 7 unstoppable artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy.

We will also take a closer look at the advancements in the artificial intelligence industry. To view more unstoppable AI stocks, check our free report on the 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe Bull Case for AI\n\nOn April 20, Matt Bryson, Wedbush Enterprise Hardware Analyst, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the major players in the AI industry and how interest rate cuts may have little to no impact on the tech wave. Shares of tech stocks including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have been down by 15% over the past 30 days, followed by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping by 10% despite recent highs previously. Despite the pullback in industry activity, Bryson holds a bullish view on artificial intelligence. Bryson highlights the fuel in AI is backed by chip stocks and cloud services providers, lifting NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). He added that despite the pullback, large tech stocks, especially chip makers, will continue investing in AI in 2025 and post strong growth results. Bryson suggests that high interest rates will certainly weigh on consumer spending in the long run, impacting high multiple stocks such as large chipmakers. He then said that interest rates may have little to no impact on the fundamental landscape of technology and AI. According to Bryson, data center operators like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will continue to bet on developing AI applications.\n\nBryson thinks that NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell, a next-gen semiconductor product, will impact the industry positively. While he is certain that AI hardware and software companies will define parameters of success for the industry, he claims it is uncertain to predict the technological developments in AI at the moment. Bryson also holds a bullish view on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and talked about the possibility of companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) developing their own semiconductor products, altering Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited's (NYSE:TSM) position in the market. Bryson said while he expects the industry to grow, it is difficult to predict what sectors AI might penetrate.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome Developments in the AI Space\n\nIn a groundbreaking update, On May 13, OpenAI launched GPT-4o, a platform capable of working across audio, vision, and text in real-time. The new application takes interactions between humans and computers to the next level. The application can provide outputs in response to audio inputs in 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds. While the new product complements GPT-4 Turbo's performance on text in English and code, it is also 50% cheaper and much faster. The tool is also equipped to understand vision and audio inputs easily.\n\nOn May 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched CoPilot + PCs, designed for artificial intelligence. The new PCs are one of the most intelligent and fastest PCs to be ever built. Its new silicon can perform 40-plus trillion operations per second, has a long battery life, and comes with built-in advanced AI models. Individuals in the custody of the new devices will be able to generate and refine images in real-time using Cocreation and function in over 40 languages using the Live Captions tool. The PCs will be made available starting June 18.\n\nWall Street is Bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

To learn about the 3 stocks that ranked higher than Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), go to 8 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOn May 17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed out at record highs, crossing the 40,000 milestone for the first time ever. However, this was a little shortlived as the index is down nearly 2.35% since that day, as of May 23. While the index seems to be underperforming the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, it doesn’t fully cover the market conditions like the latter two. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ’s performance is mostly dominated by mega-cap tech stocks, especially NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which isn’t a part of the Dow Jones index.\n\nDow Bucks Trend, Falls Despite NVIDIA's Upbeat News\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported its first-quarter 2025 earnings on May 22. Despite record numbers, the market failed to rally along with the company. This includes the Dow Jones index as all 30 of its components ended the day in red on May 23, including some of the best Dow stocks that are direct AI beneficiaries such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nIn its Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) generated a revenue of $26.04 billion, which was up over 262% year-over-year and surprised the consensus estimates by $1.45 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company’s CFO, Colette Kress said:\n\n“Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla’s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close. Nevertheless, the company failed to rally the market with it as the S&P 500 was down almost 0.75% during the same period, the NASDAQ-composite recorded a decline of 0.4% and the Dow Jones index experienced its worst day in almost 14 months declining by over 1.5%.\n\nJim Cramer: Celebrating the 40K Milestone\n\nEven though the Dow Jones index is underperforming other indices in 2024, CNBC Mad Money host, Jim Cramer still believes in celebrating its 40,000 points milestone.

        "content": "We recently identified the best dow stocks according to hedge funds. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the two healthcare stocks on our list. To check the other healthcare stock on our list, go to 8 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOn May 17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed out at record highs, crossing the 40,000 milestone for the first time ever. However, this was a little shortlived as the index is down nearly 2.35% since that day, as of May 23. While the index seems to be underperforming the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, it doesn’t fully cover the market conditions like the latter two. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ’s performance is mostly dominated by mega-cap tech stocks, especially NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which isn’t a part of the Dow Jones index.\n\nDow Bucks Trend, Falls Despite NVIDIA's Upbeat News\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported its first-quarter 2025 earnings on May 22. Despite record numbers, the market failed to rally along with the company. This includes the Dow Jones index as all 30 of its components ended the day in red on May 23, including some of the best Dow stocks that are direct AI beneficiaries such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nIn its Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) generated a revenue of $26.04 billion, which was up over 262% year-over-year and surprised the consensus estimates by $1.45 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company’s CFO, Colette Kress said:\n\n“Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla’s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close. Nevertheless, the company failed to rally the market with it as the S&P 500 was down almost 0.75% during the same period, the NASDAQ-composite recorded a decline of 0.4% and the Dow Jones index experienced its worst day in almost 14 months declining by over 1.5%.\n\nJim Cramer: Celebrating the 40K Milestone\n\nEven though the Dow Jones index is underperforming other indices in 2024, CNBC Mad Money host, Jim Cramer still believes in celebrating its 40,000 points milestone. On May 20, he urged the investors to appreciate the market's progress despite past downturns. Cramer emphasized that while the Dow does not fully represent the market like the S&P 500, it reflects a team effort across various sectors, which should have been demolished by the challenges they faced, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, inflation, and supply chain issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet they thrived. He acknowledged the potential for market declines but stressed the importance of recognizing the achievements of these stocks and companies over the years.\n\nCramer mentioned that he started as a summer associate in 1983 at Goldman Sachs when the Dow was just over 1000 points, the market was full of bears in multiple sectors but the stock market “left them behind.” He added that the index going from 1000 to 40,000 shows the strength of these companies and that they “will make you money.”\n\nIn light of these comments, some of the best Dow stocks include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). You can also take a look at the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) Best Dow Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nSource: Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, out of the 30 components of the Dow Jones index, we narrowed down our list to 8 stocks that were most widely held by institutional investors as of the first quarter of 2024. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 919 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company that provides various services and products including but not limited to Medicaid plans, consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services, care delivery, software and information products, and pharmacy care services and programs.\n\nOn May 15, Bank of America Securities analyst Kevin Fischbeck reiterated a Buy rating on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) with a price target of $675.00. He cited several reasons for the rating, including the company’s effort to grow its long-term EPS to 13-16%, strong value-based care model, and adaptable business strategy. The company’s effective cost management and ability to maintain target margins were highlighted. The analyst expects the company’s continued growth with stable margins due to its disciplined pricing and sustainable benefit design.\n\nIn the first quarter, 104 hedge funds had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), with total positions worth $8.66 billion. As of March 31, Fisher Asset Management is the most prominent shareholder in the company with a stake worth $1.47 billion.\n\nBaron Funds stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a leading health insurance company that operates across four segments: United Healthcare, Optum Health, OptumInsight, and OptumRX. Shares fell alongside other managed care organizations (MCOs) due to patient utilization of Medicare Advantage (MA) that was higher than consensus forecasts, raising concerns that MCOs had mispriced 2024 bids and could suffer margin compression as a result. In addition, the industry is facing headwinds from MA reimbursement cuts and Star Rating changes. While management said higher cost trends are mostly transitory and reflected in its bidding, and 2024 guidance was roughly in line with consensus, investors took a more cautious wait-and-see approach. We believe UnitedHealth should remain a core portfolio holding, as it is a way to play positive demographic, population health, and value-based reimbursement trends. Despite its size, we think the company should be able to grow earnings consistent with its 13% to 16% long-term EPS annual target, the fastest among major MCOs.”\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is number seven on our list of the best Dow stocks.

        "title": "The State with the Worst Public School System in the US",
        "content": "We recently did a state-wise analysis of the quality of public school systems across the US and in this article we will discuss the state with the worst public school system. Check out our free report on the 20 States with the Worst Public School System in the US.\n\nOverview of Education in the US\n\nAlthough the United States is considered to be one of the best countries in the world in terms of education standards, the country has a diverse academic landscape. According to data by UNESCO, the United States spent $1.162 trillion on education as of 2020. The government’s expenditure on pre-primary education came up to 0.34% of its total GDP, while the same for primary and secondary education stood at 1.53% and 1.73% as of 2020, respectively. In addition, the country spends 1.81% of its total GDP on tertiary education as of the same year.\n\nThe United States held the fifth position in the list of expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrolled in the OECD countries in elementary or secondary level institutions as of 2019, with a per student expenditure of $15,500. Luxembourg, Norway, Austria, and the Republic of Korea held the first positions. Luxembourg and Norway spent $25,600 and $18,000 on primary/secondary school education as of 2019, respectively, while Austria and the Republic of Korea spent $15,900 each as of the same year. However, since the expense per FTE student refers to the average amount spent on a student, the total expenditures may vary at local and state levels. That is precisely why different states in the US have varying per student expenditures on education. You can also look at\n\n30 Best Paying Jobs With High School Degrees for further insight.\n\nCorporate Initiatives for Making Education Accessible\n\nThere are several companies working to improve education accessibility in the US. Take Amazon Inc, (NASDAQ:AMZN) for example. On April 17, Amazon Inc, (NASDAQ:AMZN) awarded the 2024 Amazon Future Engineer Scholarships worth $40,000 to five graduating seniors in high schools. The scholarship will enable the students to pursue a four-year engineering or computer science degree program. It will also offer them a paid internship opportunity after their freshman year, along with specialized mentorship from Amazon leaders.\n\nAnother example is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The company's Live Better U (LBU) program promotes accessibility in education by incentivizing education for its employees. By partnering with top academic institutions like the University of Arkansas, Purdue Global, Southern New Hampshire University, University of Denver, and others, the company has helped its employees save over $500 million in college tuition. The program has helped more than 126,000 get a better education and choose their career path. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) also announced an investment of about $1 billion to pay for its employees' tuition and textbooks between 2021 and 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow that we have discussed statistics related to the education situation in the US, let's talk about the state with the worst public school system. State with the Worst Public School System in the US\n\nryan-de-hamer-yilpftAIsSA-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to compile our list of the 20 states with the worst public school systems in the US, we have considered the pupil-to-teacher ratio, SAT scores of high school seniors, and the per student expenditure on education by each state as the primary metrics. We then computed the average ranking of each state according to its position in the list of each of the three metrics, calling it the Insider Monkey Score. We chose the bottom 20 states as the ones with the worst public school systems in the US, with 7 being the lowest Insider Monkey Score for the state with the worst public school system in the US. We assumed that the US states with the worst public school systems in the US have a high pupil-to-student ratio, low SAT mean scores of high school seniors, and low per student expenditure on education. In cases where states have the same Insider Monkey Score, we have considered the percentage of the graduating class taking the SAT as a tie-breaker. We have assumed that the worst states for education have a low percentage of the graduating class taking the SAT.\n\nData for pupil-to-teacher ratio for full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers as of Fall 2021, SAT mean scores of high school seniors as of 2023, and current expenditures per student in average daily attendance in public elementary and secondary schools as of the academic year 2020-2021 have been taken from the National Center for Education Statistics. Data for the percentage of graduating class taking the SAT has also been taken from the National Center for Education Statistics. The 20 states with the worst public school systems in the US are arranged in ascending order of their Insider Monkey Score. You can also look at\n\n22 Medical Schools with the Highest Acceptance Rates in America and\n\n25 Least Competitive Dental Schools in America.\n\nThe State with the Worst Public School System\n\nOklahoma\n\nPupil-to-Teacher Ratio as of Fall 2021: 16.2\n\nSAT Mean Scores of High School Seniors as of 2023: 953\n\nPer Pupil Expenditure on Education as of 2020-2021: $12,326 (In Constant USD as of 2022-2023)\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 7\n\n% of Graduating Class Taking the SAT as of 2021: 18%\n\nOur methodology revealed that Oklahoma is the state with the worst public school system in the US. The state has a 16.2 pupil-to-teacher ratio as of fall 2021, with 43,090 teachers and a total student enrollment of 698,696 in public elementary and secondary schools as of the same year. As of the academic year 2020-2021, Oklahoma spends about $12,326 on its per pupil education needs, with the amount considered in constant USD as of 2022-2023. With the total per pupil expense being the third lowest in the United States, Oklahoma is considered to have the worst public school system in the country. High school seniors enrolled in public high schools in the state have an SAT mean score of 953 as of 2023. The score is the third lowest in the country, with New Mexico and West Virginia standing at the forefront with median SAT scores of 901 and 923, respectively.\n\nTo learn about US states that have better quality school systems than Oklahoma, read our free report on the 20 States with the Worst Public School Systems in the US.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Micron but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Stocks That Have Created Many Millionaires, and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite index has climbed about 118% over the last five years despite the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic downturn in 2022. The figure illustrates how lucrative investing in certain companies and holding even amid poor market conditions can be.\n\nConsequently, it's not a bad idea to invest in some of the Nasdaq Composite's most prominent players with plans to hold over many years. As the world's second and sixth most valuable companies, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options.\n\nThese companies dominate their respective industries and have created many millionaires over the years, with Apple's stock up 319% since 2019 and Amazon's up 96%. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon have some exciting developments in the pipeline that could deliver major gains in the coming years.\n\nSo, here are two magnificent stocks that have created millionaires and will continue to make more.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nOne of the most attractive aspects of Amazon is its thoroughly diverse business model. The company is best known as a king of e-commerce, with its leading 38% market share in the industry. Amazon's dominance in online retail is demonstrated by Walmart's second-largest market share in e-commerce, responsible for just 6% of the sector.\n\nAmazon's retail business remains a lucrative venture, with revenue in its North America and International segments rising 12% year over year and 10% in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, retail operating income achieved a combined $6 billion, significantly improving on the negative $349 million it posted in the year-ago quarter.\n\nHowever, Amazon is a lot more than e-commerce. The company is home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which reported sales growth of 17% year over year in Q1 2024 (its largest rise in a year). AWS' operating income rose 84% to more than $9 billion during the quarter, with the cloud service responsible for 62% of Amazon's total operating income despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three main segments.\n\nIn addition to stellar retail and cloud growth, Q1 2024 suggested that the company could have a lucrative future in digital advertising -- a market predominantly dominated by Alphabet and Meta Platforms. The quarter saw revenue from advertising services soar 24%, with much of that growth thanks to the introduction of ads on its Prime Video streaming service.\n\nAmazon's stock trades at about 40 times its forward earnings, indicating that it's not exactly a bargain. However, the company's stock has already risen 20% year to date. Alongside significant growth potential in multiple markets, Amazon's stock is likely worth its premium price tag and could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple has a long history of providing loyal investors with consistent and significant gains. However, repeated hits to its business and concerns over product sales have seen its stock decline 1% since the start of 2024. The company's long-term relevancy has been questioned as product sales dipped and crucial markets like China increasingly prefer domestic offerings over Apple's.\n\nYet, Apple is making moves to boost its product business with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, a rapidly expanding services business is gradually allowing the company to depend less on product sales.\n\nShares in Apple have popped 16% in the last month, almost entirely thanks to its expanding efforts in AI. The company rallied investors in early May when it debuted its newest iPad Air. The tablet is the first device to use Apple's most powerful chip yet, the M4, which is said to vastly expand the company's AI capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, Apple plans to revamp its Mac lineup and aspects of its smartphones to better cater to the rising demand for AI services.\n\nDespite recent headwinds, Apple remains a behemoth in consumer tech. Billions of consumers continue to choose its products over rival devices, giving the company ample opportunity to tout its AI products.\n\nIn addition to a solid outlook in AI, Apple's digital services division is booming. In the second quarter of 2024 (ended March 2024), the segment posted revenue growth of 14% year over year, significantly outperforming all other segments. The trajectory of services is promising for Apple's future as it allows the company to lean less on its products' business over time, fortifying it against macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, there might be better-valued options than Apple. However, the figure is significantly lower than Amazon's 40 and Microsoft's 36, potentially making Apple one of the best-valued AI stocks. In addition to a potent position in tech, Apple is worth considering right now and one that could make you a millionaire.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

With that in mind, the ROCE of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.13 = US$47b ÷ (US$531b - US$153b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 11%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 13% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 230% in that time. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTo sum it up, Amazon.com has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 104% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nWhile Amazon.com doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for AMZN on our platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Amazon.com isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett doesn't like stocks -- at least, not many of them right now. He told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders earlier this month that he finds it \"quite attractive\" to sit atop a massive cash stockpile instead of buying stocks.\n\nJust because the legendary investor isn't putting Berkshire's money to work doesn't mean you shouldn't put yours to work in the market. And you can find some great candidates within Berkshire's portfolio. Here are three no-brainer Buffett stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nLou Gerstner, who led IBM's comeback in the 1990s, wrote a book years ago titled Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?. I think that title applies well to Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), even though the e-commerce and cloud services giant doesn't need a turnaround like IBM did back then.\n\nAmazon continues to give shareholders plenty to dance about. The stock soared nearly 81% last year. It's up around 20% so far in 2024. I expect the momentum will continue.\n\nOne number in Amazon's first-quarter results sums up why investors like the stock so much these days: 229%. That's how much the company's earnings soared year over year in Q1. Amazon is still working hard to increase revenue and reduce its costs further -- the textbook recipe for sustained earnings growth.\n\nI like Amazon's opportunities in digital advertising. But I love its Amazon Web Services business prospects with the ongoing tailwind created by generative AI. Buffett hasn't added to Berkshire's position in Amazon since 2019. However, I think now is a great time to buy shares of this perennial leader.\n\n2. Marubeni\n\nMarubeni (OTC: MARUF)(OTC: MARUY) is probably one of the least-followed stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, it's one of Buffett's favorite stocks. He wrote to shareholders earlier this year that Marubeni is among a select group of stocks he thinks Berkshire will \"maintain indefinitely.\"\n\nMarubeni is a huge Japanese conglomerate. It was founded in 1858 and operates in a wide range of industries, including aerospace, agriculture, chemicals, consumer goods, energy, finance, food, forest products, information technology, metals and mineral resources, and utilities.\n\nMarubeni is one of five Japanese stocks Berkshire bought a few years ago; Buffett likes each company's smart stock buybacks and attractive dividends. Most importantly, though, he appreciates their business models and management teams.\n\nWhy did I pick Marubeni out of these five stocks? Valuation. Marubeni's shares trade at roughly 11 times trailing earnings, the cheapest multiple in the group.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Occidental Petroleum\n\nI mentioned earlier that Buffett doesn't like many stocks these days. Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) is a notable exception. He's regularly added to Berkshire's position in the oil producer, including buying another 4.3 million shares in Q1.\n\nOccidental is another stock the Oracle of Omaha thinks Berkshire will own for a long time to come. He likes the company's significant U.S. oil and gas assets and its leadership in carbon capture technology. Buffett also has tremendous respect for Oxy's CEO, Vicki Hollub.\n\nBerkshire's continued purchases of Occidental could help drive the stock higher. The conglomerate secured regulatory approval in 2022 to acquire up to 50% of the company but currently owns only 28%.\n\nThat's not the main reason this stock is a no-brainer buy, though. Occidental is reasonably priced with a forward earnings multiple under 15. Hollub predicts an oil supply shortage by late 2025. Even if her timing is off, her reasoning appears to be solid. I look for Oxy to deliver solid gains over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Unparalleled Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "Short-term unpredictability has been the name of the game on Wall Street since this decade began. The first four years of the decade saw all three major stock indexes pivot between bear and bull markets in successive years, with no index enduring wilder swings than the innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq lost a third of its value. But since the green flag waved in 2023, the Nasdaq Composite has surged higher by 61% and notched multiple record-closing highs. There's absolutely no doubt that this growth-focused index is squarely in a bull market, albeit a fairly young one. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile some investors might be apprehensive about putting their money to work on Wall Street with the Nasdaq Composite at an all-time high, history shows that every stock market correction and bear market throughout history in the major indexes has eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally. This is to say that any time can be an opportune time to put your money to work on Wall Street if you're a long-term investor.\n\nFurthermore, value can be found -- even among growth stocks. Investors simply have to be willing to search for these hidden treasures.\n\nWhat follows are four unparalleled growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first exceptional growth stock investors can confidently add to their portfolios, even with the Nasdaq running to fresh highs, is e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Despite select predictive indicators and money-based metrics signaling a heightened risk of a U.S. recession, Amazon's most-important operating segments are perfectly positioned to thrive.\n\nAlthough Amazon is best known for its online marketplace, which brought in an estimated 37.6% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023, the company generates most of its operating cash flow and income from segments that aren't necessarily as consumer-facing.\n\nNothing is more important to Amazon's future than the continued growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 31% share as of the end of 2023, per tech-analysis firm Canalys.\n\nThough AWS recently surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales, enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings of forecast growth. AWS regularly accounts for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income and is the segment fueling its cash-flow growth.\n\nAdvertising services and subscription services are vital for Amazon, too. Advertising hasn't grown by less than 20% on a year-over-year basis in more than two years. Meanwhile, the company has strong subscription pricing power with Prime. In exchange for simple perks, such as free two-day shipping on most items from its online marketplace, it encourages more than 200 million subscribers worldwide to stay within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon also remains historically inexpensive. Shares can be purchased right now for about 12 times consensus cash flow for 2025. That's a marked discount to the multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow that investors willingly paid to buy shares throughout the 2010s.\n\nDocuSign\n\nA second unparalleled growth stock you'll regret not buying with the Nasdaq in a young bull market is electronic-signature company DocuSign(NASDAQ: DOCU).\n\nIn recent months, there's been speculation that DocuSign could be acquired and taken private. But CEO Allan Thygesen said an interview with CNBC this past week that his company intends to remain public. While short-term traders who had been banking on a buyout might not be thrilled with these comments, long-term investors should rejoice.\n\nOne reason to be thrilled about DocuSign remaining public is its moat in e-signatures. According to Datanyze, DocuSign accounts for more than 67% of the e-signature market. While growth in e-signatures has slowed a bit following the worst of the pandemic and with interest rates climbing (i.e., fewer loans and mortgages are being underwritten), a double-digit long-term growth trajectory is likely for the global e-signature software market.\n\nAnother reason to trust in DocuSign is the company's balance sheet. During its January-ended quarter (DocuSign's fiscal year ends on Jan. 31), it repaid the entirety of its outstanding convertible debt. The roughly $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and investments the company was sitting on to begin fiscal 2025 gives it the flexibility to innovate internally, as well as grow inorganically.\n\nFor example, just three weeks ago, the company announced a $165 million all-cash acquisition of Lexion, an agreement-management software company driven by artificial intelligence. Incorporating agreement management into its suite of existing services has the potential to lift DocuSign's growth rate and expand its sales channels.\n\nAnd its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16 is a bargain for a growth stock with a well-defined moat. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGreen Thumb Industries\n\nA third matchless growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not purchasing during the new Nasdaq bull market is cannabis multi-state operator (MSO) Green Thumb Industries(OTC: GTBIF).\n\nThe big buzz for marijuana stocks is that a long-awaited rescheduling of cannabis appears to (finally) be at hand. This past week, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration published its formal proposal that would see cannabis move from a Schedule I controlled substance to a less-stringent Schedule III controlled substance.\n\nWhile moving cannabis to Schedule III won't legalize it for recreational purposes, it would no longer subject cannabis-touching businesses, including MSOs, to Section 280E of the U.S. tax code. Section 280E only allows businesses dealing with Schedule I and II controlled substances to deduct cost of goods sold. If and when this move is made official, MSOs like Green Thumb will owe far less in federal tax, which should translate into faster earnings growth.\n\nWhat separates Green Thumb from a sea of other MSOs is its product mix. During the first quarter, it generated 57% of its sales from derivatives, which include vapes, edibles, pre-rolls, concentrates, beverages, and health and beauty products. Derivatives have higher prices and substantially better margins than traditional dried cannabis flower. This product mix has played a key role in making Green Thumb profitable.\n\nGreen Thumb Industries also has a presence in many of the top-selling cannabis states, including California, Florida, and Illinois. It has 93 operating dispensaries in 14 states, and its back pocket is full of retail licenses that can be used to further expand its dispensary footprint in key markets.\n\nVisa\n\nA fourth unparalleled growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is payment processor Visa(NYSE: V). Although it is subject to the same cyclical headwinds that have some investors skeptical about Amazon, Visa's clear-cut competitive advantages make it a surefire buy for those with a long investment horizon.\n\nFor instance, Visa benefits from disproportionately long periods of economic growth. Even though recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they tend to be short-lived. By comparison, most economic expansions endure for multiple years. For Visa, it means extended periods of consumers and businesses increasing their spending.\n\nTo add to this point, Visa's management team has purposely avoided becoming a lender. Since it's entirely focused on facilitating transactions, the company doesn't have to worry about possible credit delinquencies and loan losses when economic downturns take shape. Not having to set aside capital to cover these potential losses is a big-time advantage in the financial sector.\n\nSimilar to the other companies on this list, Visa's growth runway stretches years into the future, if not decades. Aside from being the top dog in the U.S. in terms of credit-card network purchase volume, it has the opportunity to expand its payment infrastructure into chronically underbanked regions of the world, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Cross border volume surged 16% in its March-ended quarter.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "If you were able to identify in advance the rare stocks that could turn $1,000 into a cool million, you wouldn't have to do much to be set for life. But no one has a crystal ball, which is why diversification is just as important as picking top stocks. There are all sorts of factors that could send any given stock plummeting or skyrocketing, and you can never know which ones will carry the day (or week, or month, or year).\n\nThe hard part of investing isn't necessarily coming up with the funds to invest or agonizing over corporate financial statements. Often, the hardest part is maintaining the fortitude to hang on to your investments through the tough times and let the magic of compound growth do its work.\n\nConsider Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart(NYSE: WMT), and Home Depot(NYSE: HD). Each of these stocks has had major downswings at times, but if you'd invested $1,000 in any of them when they went public, you'd have more than $1 million today.\n\nThe Amazon of e-commerce\n\nAmazon's overall returns have been some of the highest in the history of the stock market. If you'd invested $1,000 in Amazon stock at the time of its initial public offering (IPO), you'd have almost $1.9 million today. AMZN Chart\n\nAs you can see in the chart, that includes a major downturn in 2022, in addition to other bumps along the road. What's happening today? Amazon is still reporting double-digit percentage growth, a truly remarkable feat given the size of the base it's building on. Even more, it still has incredible opportunities in artificial intelligence on top of strong potential in its core e-commerce business.\n\nThe largest retailer in the world\n\nWalmart isn't a growth stock anymore, but even though it keeps looking like Amazon is growing fast enough to take over as the world's largest retailer, the e-commerce powerhouse hasn't been able to knock it from the top spot. The discount chain is still growing at about mid-single-digit percentage rates, which is truly impressive considering its gargantuan size. Walmart has been a public company a lot longer than Amazon, and if you'd invested $1,000 in it in 1970 with dividends reinvested, you'd have more than $4.6 million today. WMT Total Return Level data by YCharts\n\nIt does appear that Amazon will dethrone it one of these days, but Walmart has been doing all kinds of things to generate growth and stay on top. It's joining the streaming space to leverage an advertising business and fine-tuning its merchandise in different locations to better meet regional demand. It may eventually lose the world's largest retailer title, but it won't lose its status as an excellent business. Plus, it pays a growing dividend.\n\nStory continues\n\nA millionaire-maker that might surprise you\n\nYou might have expected to see Amazon and Walmart on this list, but you might be surprised that Home Depot is here. After all, it's a niche retailer. But if you'd invested $1,000 in its stock early enough, your Home Depot holding would be worth much more now than if you'd invested in the IPOs of either Amazon or Walmart. HD Total Return Level data by YCharts\n\nHome Depot is an excellent business, and today it enjoys a strong moat thanks to its investments in technology and its dominant position within its niche. It's feeling some pressure in the current macroeconomic environment, and its stock price -- after some ups and downs -- is close to flat so far this year, so this could be an excellent time to buy in. In the meantime, it pays a competitive and growing dividend, and reinvesting it accounts for $12 million of the total return.\n\nCan they still make you millionaires?\n\nFrom their current massive sizes, it's more or less impossible for these three companies to increase in value again by 1,000 times or more, so $1,000 invested in these companies today won't make you a millionaire. However, they've all demonstrated that they have great business models, and they could still create plenty of additional value for their shareholders over time. Not every stock will make you a millionaire, but diversification in your portfolio can help you get there.\n\nI want to finish by clarifying that this is an exercise to bring home the value of long-term investing. Most retail investors don't get to invest in any companies at their IPOs, and few stocks have achieved the accomplishment of turning $1,000 into $1 million. But investors who start early, invest in great companies, and hold onto their investments for the long haul so that their growth can compound over time can definitely create wealth and become millionaires.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Retail Earnings &amp; Consumer Spending: A Closer Look",
        "content": "The U.S. economy is chugging along, with the growth pace moderately decelerating under the weight of the Fed’s tight monetary policy.\n\nMany in the market had hoped that at the start of the year, the central bank would have started easing by now. But then inflation readings started misbehaving in the first few months of the year, changing this Fed outlook as a result. The expectation is still for one to two rate cuts this year, but there isn’t a lot of conviction in this outlook.\n\nThe timing of the first Fed rate cut is a huge preoccupation for stock market investors. However, with the unemployment rate at a multi-decade low, household buying power remains largely intact, even though most of the Covid savings have already been used up. And that’s what we saw in the Q1 earnings season, with consumer spending largely holding up.\n\nWhile household finances in the aggregate are in reasonably good shape, there is stress at the lower end of the income distribution. Notwithstanding the still-plentiful jobs and the steady deceleration in inflation, the cumulative inflationary rise has exceeded the comparable wage gains. One data source shows a roughly +20% cumulative inflationary rise since February 2020, when Covid got underway.\n\nWhile overall spending remains healthy, consumer preferences shifted in the post-Covid period towards services like leisure, entertainment, and travel and less towards ‘stuff’ like apparel, home goods, and the like.\n\nIt is this shift in consumer preferences that accounts for the performance variance between Walmart WMT and Target TGT. As we noted here before, Target’s merchandise leans heavily towards discretionary categories that aren’t a priority for consumers at present. On the other hand, Walmart has a vast grocery business and has been attracting an ever-growing share on higher income households attracted to the company’s convenient pick-up and delivery offerings.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 28 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 28 retailers that have reported are up +32% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see here, these companies have been finding it hard to beat estimates.\n\nWith respect to earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 28 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution. One can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 481 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 24th. We have almost 100 companies reporting results this week, including 10 S&P 500 members. This week's line-up includes more retailers like Best Buy, Ulta, Dollar General, and Tech players like Salesforce, HP, and others.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 81 index members are up +7% from the same period last year on +4.4% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe have been flagging an acceleration in the earnings growth trend, which becomes more apparent once the Bristol Myers drag is removed from the data; the pharma giant came out with a huge one-time charge. The chart below shows the Q1 earnings growth pace for these companies on an ex-BMY basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings growth for these companies would have been +10% instead of +7% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been on the weaker side for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.8% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.9% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nThe chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2024 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -0.7%, while the growth pace improves to +9.7% on an ex-energy basis.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9% on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nThe revisions trend has been very favorable for Q2 estimates, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is the Q2 revisions trend on an ex-Energy basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% on +1.6% revenue growth.

        "title": "Lucky Number Seven: 3 Growth Stocks That Can 7X in the Next Decade",
        "content": "Building a portfolio that can see you through retirement requires finding stocks that can not only enjoy capital appreciation but also income generation. The makes dividend growth stocks an important component of an investor’s long-term strategy.\n\nDividend growth investing has proved to be the best method of amassing generational wealth. It is better than buying bonds, gold, real estate — or even non-dividend-paying stocks! That’s because historically dividends have made up as much as 40% of the S&P 500‘s annual return going all the way back to 1930. It’s been an amazingly consistent track record that investors can use to their advantage.\n\nWhat follows are three of the best growth stocks to buy for building a lifetime of riches.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first growth stock investors should consider buying is Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). The beauty products and personal care leader has a phenomenal track record of creating expanding shareholder value.\n\nOver the past decade, Ulta has quadrupled in value with a 343% return for investors. And despite my highlighting the importance of finding dividend growth stocks to buy, the beauty care company actually does not pay a dividend. So why recommend it? Because I think it can and will pay one in the near future.\n\nUlta has a terrific decade-long history of sharply growing sales, profits and free cash flow (FCF) per share. At the same time it has reduced the number of shares outstanding and embarked on a pattern of reducing its debt. So far Ulta has been using its significant FCF generation to create a lean, financially sound business. But because FCF per share now exceeds $20 it is clear that Ulta Beauty can readily support paying a generous dividend to shareholders.\n\nWhile the stock market crushed the stock over the past few months on concerns over a dicey economy impacting consumers, that is a transitory situation and the outlook over the next decade is quite healthy. With plans for expansion into Mexico, Ulta Beauty is a deeply discounted growth stock to buy.\n\nS&P Global (SPGI) Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&P Global (SPGI)\n\nSource: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nS&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), on the other hand, is a dividend growth stock that should be high on your list. Arguably best known as the owner of numerous stock market indices, most notably the S&P 500, the ​​financial information and analytics firm is poised for exceptional growth for the next 10 years and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has richly rewarded shareholders with a total return of more than 500% over the past decade. While the yield of under 1% is nothing to write home about, S&P Global regularly increases the payout every year. In 2013, it paid a dividend of $1.12 per share but with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7%, the annualized payout is now $3.64 per share. More impressive, S&P Global has grown its FCF by a muscular 17.7% CAGR.\n\nBecause it has a low earnings-based payout ratio of 43% and an even lower 32% FCF payout ratio, the financial services firm has plenty of cash available to keep paying its dividend and raising the payout. The payout ratio indicates how much cash it is using after paying its bills to pay its dividend. Lower is better and S&P Global’s is well within the margin of safety.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last growth stock to buy is tech titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Its 10-year track record of generating shareholder returns is unparalleled. Its total return over that time period is 1,150%, for a CAGR of over 29%. In comparison, the S&P 500 has returned less than 234%. That’s nearly a five-to-one outperformance by the software giant.\n\nAs is well-known by now, Microsoft has fully embraced artificial intelligence (AI) as its long-term growth strategy. Integrating the technology throughout its products and services has made Microsoft one of the premier AI stocks on the market. It even makes its own AI chip called Maia. Shares are up 35% over the past year as a result and yet it still trades at about 2x sales.\n\nDespite this tremendous growth, Wall Street still sees more room to run. Analysts forecast earnings will grow 16% annually for the next five years. They may be underselling it. Microsoft’s cloud services business Azure is one of the fastest growing opportunities, making it essential to businesses moving their data to the cloud. It is the second biggest cloud business behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nIt’s dividend also yields less than 1% but it has grown the annualized payout from 97 cents a decade ago to $3.00 per share today. That’s a 10% CAGR with FCF growing more than 9% annually.\n\nThe past 10 years have been amazing for investors but the next 10 should see it only pad that lead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The cybersecurity investment theme still stands out now that many potential attackers are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to compromise systems. Undoubtedly, the leading cybersecurity companies are also making good use of AI. With such a powerful technology that can be used to beef up offense or defense, investors should continue to stick with the market’s top defenders as they look to protect and defend with the full power of AI on their side.\n\nI like to check in with the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK) to gauge how the cybersecurity market has been doing. IHAK stock has recently been steadily climbing after experiencing a short-lived correction of around 13% earlier this year. Still down around 8% from its peak, I see potential value in the space. Let’s check in with three of my favorite cybersecurity stocks to buy to play the AI-driven theme.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an $84 billion cybersecurity company leading the charge. At writing, CRWD stock is shy of its all-time highs, just shy of $350 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith a remarkably strong first quarter that saw subscription revenues surge 42% to $651.2 million, up from $459.8 billion in the same quarter last year, Crowdstrike certainly seems like the high-momentum cybersecurity stock to own with all the momentum behind it and impressive generative AI features that could further enhance its impressive offerings.\n\nCharlotte AI is the company’s security analyst who may offer a glimpse into the future of cybersecurity in the generative AI age. With its recently announced collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Service to help with its generative AI endeavors, Crowdstrike stands out as an AI-first company that could quickly outgrow the peer group in the coming years.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a more intriguing value option in the booming cybersecurity space for investors who don’t like chasing hot stocks near their highs. The company is in a bit of a slump, now down around 22% from its all-time high in the middle of 2023.\n\nThe firm clocked in $1.41 billion in total bookings last year, a slight drop of 6% year over year. Indeed, challenging comparables bear part of the blame. Looking ahead, Fortinet stands to tap into AI to help it keep up with rivals and the growing number of AI-equipped attackers.\n\nThe company has its own IoT generative AI assistant named FortiAI, which includes many capabilities that could help neutralize threats. Perhaps the market is discounting FortiAI’s full potential after a rough quarter that I do not view as the start of a negative trend. At 34.4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I actually see FTNT stock as one of the better bargains in cybersecurity today.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) also looks like an intriguing value option after its brutal 30% implosion in February 2024. Undoubtedly, FTNT stock has come back quite a bit in recent months, but it’s still off around 18% from its peak.\n\nJust a few days ago, Fortinet reported a mild earnings beat for its fiscal third quarter. Adjusted profits came in at $1.32, narrowly ahead of the $1.25 estimate. As for the forecast, Palo Alto sees revenue coming in line with expectations in the ballpark of $2.15-2.17 billion.\n\nLike other cybersecurity innovations, Palo Alto is serious about improving its products with AI to help fight “advanced” cyber threats. Its Precision AI solution aims to “fight AI with AI.” Indeed, clients armed with Precision AI playing chess as potential attackers look to play checkers!\n\nAt 49.5 times forward P/E, PANW stock still seems a bit pricy. Perhaps waiting for a more substantial pullback would be best as the firm looks to stay ahead of AI-augmented hackers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction among sports clients on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest five-year agreement between Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and FWD Group Holdings Limited (“FWD”). The agreement is the extension of the latter’s cloud technology collaboration with AWS.\r\n\r\nThis highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.\r\n\r\nPer the agreement, AWS has become the strategic cloud provider of FWD. In order to support its cloud-first strategy, FWD intends to leverage AWS’s cloud computing capabilities, agility and scalability.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS’s customer base.\r\n\r\nAWS’s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Brightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter’s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\r\nWe believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS’s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here’s Why Jim Cramer is Bearish on Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA)",
        "content": "Insider Monkey recently published a list of 7 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish On. Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA) ranks second in that list. Since Under Armour is a popular name among both hedge funds and retail investors, it deserver a detailed look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program yet again lamented over the market's obsession about the Fed's stance over sticky inflation, saying the latest Fed minutes from April 30 to May 1 spooked investors because the central bank officials seem to be getting \"impatient\" with the inflation's slower-than-expected decline.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that economic data released after these Fed minutes showed that the labor market as well as inflation are cooling, exactly what the Fed wants. Cramer said had the Fed officials seen this data before, their minutes would have been different.\n\nCramer said that the Fed needs to know that their \"inflation lamentation\" from three weeks ago isn’t necessary.\n\nJim Cramer said that consumer spending has been the biggest issue for the Federal Reserve as they wonder, \"is they any place that's too high for them (consumers).\" Cramer acknowledged that without putting brakes on consumer spending it'd be impossible to beat inflation.\n\nHowever, the CNBC host said that if Fed officials had paid attention they'd have found that they are \"finally\" winning their battle against consumer spending too.\n\nJim Cramer said there are \"nascent signs\" showing that the consumers are finally saying \"enough is enough.\" Cramer pointed to Walmart's latest numbers as a sign of consumers' preference for discount retailers. Cramer said Walmart is one of the few companies offering value in budget.\n\n\"The Consumer Has Had Enough\"\n\n\"After years of seemingly endless price increases, the consumer has had enough. Consumers are now staying more at home.\"\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted latest comments from Kevin Hourican, the CEO of Sysco, which supplies food products to restaurants. Hourican said that the industry needs to do \"something\" about the rising prices that are affecting foot traffic at restaurants.\n\nJim Cramer thinks a \"consumer rebellion\" is happening in the industry which has executives scratching their heads.\n\nAnother sign of this rebellion, according to Cramer, is major companies like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) rolling out budget options. Cramer said that consumers also has had enough of price increases at McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), and the company needed these budget menu offerings to increase traffic.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cramer is bullish on stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), he's recommending investors to stay away from UAA. Let's see why.\n\nUnder Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nJim Cramer recently said in a program that he's a \"huge supporter\" of Kevin Plank, Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) founder and CEO.  However, he said he's not a supporter of the stock. That's because, according to Cramer, the competition in the athletic apparel industry is very high. Cramer said he's sure if Kevin Plank goes to another industry he'd be \"crushing it\" but in this industry you have to compete with major players like Nike and New Balance.\n\n\"These are just serious competitors and you've got to be on your game every second.\"\n\nWall Street analysts are also questioning Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) future following downbeat fiscal Q4 results. J.P. Morgan analyst Matthew recently said that increasing competition in the industry and Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) 18-month reset plan would leave it lagging behind peers, as he downgraded the stock to $6\n\n\"While we see secular health/wellness and casualization tailwinds providing Sportswear sector insulation, we see Under Armour lagging peers in terms of innovation, profitability, and DTC infrastructure,\" the analyst said.\n\nUnder Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA) shares are down about 20% so far this year.\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on UAA, he's recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOf the 919 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 33 funds reported owning stakes in Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA). The biggest stake in Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA) is owned by Anand Parekh's Alyeska Investment Group which owns a $44 million stake in Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA).\n\nUnder Armour ranks 2nd in our list of the 7 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish On.     If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Salesforce",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Salesforce CRM.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Boosts AWS Clientele with NinjaTech AI Deal\n\nAmazon continues to ride on its robust cloud computing arm — Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\"). The solid customer momentum of AWS is driving the company's top line. Shares of Amazon have rallied 20.4% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 index's growth of 12.7%.\n\nThe latest partnership of a generative AI company called NinjaTech AI with AWS is a testament to the above-mentioned fact.\n\nThe former launched the next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using AWS's machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\n\nApart from these next-generation chips, NinjaTech AI is leveraging Amazon SageMaker in a bid to make training of the underlined AI agents fast, flexible and affordable.\n\nWith the help of AWS cloud solutions, Ninja is capable of saving time and money by implementing generative AI in everyday workflows.\n\nAWS's Portfolio Strength: A Key Catalyst\n\nNinjaTech AI's latest move highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services. Moreover, it has added strength to AWS's customer base.\n\nBoth Trainium and Inferentia2 chips are designed to support the larger 70B variants of the latest popular open-source models like Llama 3. While Trainium chips help train Large Language Models at low costs by powering high-performance compute clusters on AWS, Inferentia2 chips enable models to generate inferences faster and at much lower costs.\n\nIn addition to these chips, AWS recently introduced Amazon Bedrock innovations in order to bolster generative AI strength. These innovations include the latest custom model import capability and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails, which are designed to deliver easy, fast and secure ways to develop advanced generative AI applications and experiences.\n\nAWS also made its generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q generally available.\n\nAWS's growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings are likely to continue driving customer momentum. This, in turn, will continue to drive AWS's top-line growth in the near term and the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn first-quarter 2024, AWS sales (18% of the total sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion.\n\nStrengthening the AWS segment, in turn, will boost Amazon's overall financial performance.\n\nFor second-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $148.54 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.5%.\n\nThe same for earnings per share stands at $1.02, which indicates a year-over-year rise of 61.9%.\n\nRising Competition\n\nAmazon's solidifying prospects in the promising cloud computing market are expected to continue providing a competitive advantage over its peers like Microsoft and Alphabet's Google, which are also gaining steam.\n\nMicrosoft is continuously riding on strong momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business, driven by the solid adoption of Azure. Strength in Azure AI remains a positive. The company's strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI are noteworthy. Also, growth in AI Copilot is contributing well to Microsoft's cloud business.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud, which has turned out to be the key catalyst for Alphabet's growth, is gaining from the growing generative AI capabilities, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace remains a major positive.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Salesforce, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nShares of Salesforce have gained 8.3% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for CRM is 17.45%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Dan Loeb Just Loaded Up on These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "One of the best ways to get a glimpse into the minds of prominent investors is to look at their 13F filings. These forms are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and break down the buying and selling activity of large institutional money managers.\n\nRecently, I parsed through the 13F of Third Point, a hedge fund started by billionaire investor Dan Loeb. Given the moves he is making, I would say that Loeb is bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). While this shouldn't come as a surprise, I was intrigued by the particular companies he's buying.\n\nThe AI narrative has been dominated by Microsoft and Nvidia so far. Nevertheless, Loeb made some splashy buys in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" recently buying 900,000 shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and 3 million shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nI like these moves a lot. Let's break down how Amazon and Alphabet are quietly emerging as leaders in the AI realm, and explore why each stock is a lucrative buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon: The cash-flow machine\n\nAmazon is primarily known for its e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nBut over the years, the company has quietly expanded into other growth areas including streaming, advertising, grocery delivery, and more. Building such a diversified business has provided Amazon with a unique opportunity.\n\nThe thesis is that Amazon can integrate AI-powered services across its ecosystem, thereby reaching consumers on a broader level and cross-selling more products to them.\n\nOne of the most important moves Amazon made in the last year was a $4 billion investment in an AI start-up called Anthropic. The main idea was to use Anthropic to accelerate growth in AWS. It uses AWS as its primary cloud provider and is training its generative AI models on Amazon's infrastructure.\n\nThis is important because Anthropic is ultimately serving as a source of lead generation for AWS, helping propel deals for new products including Amazon Bedrock.\n\nAnother move is Amazon's investments in data centers. The company recently committed $11 billion to build new data centers in Indiana. This decision came at a crucial time.\n\nAt the moment, Nvidia dominates the market for AI semiconductors. But Amazon is developing its own line of chips, Trainium and Inferentia. Building its own data centers should help it become more independent with chips in the long run. It also provides Amazon with a path to keep the majority of its AI ambitions internal, relying less on third-party providers.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEven though the AI revolution is very much in its infancy, over the last 12 months Amazon has generated $50 billion of free cash flow as the company witnesses new growth across its entire business.\n\nI think AWS in particular has a bright future. Furthermore, as AI becomes more engrained across Amazon's entire business, the investments it is making today are extremely savvy, and I am bullish on the long-term payoff.\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 3.3, nearly identical to its 10-year average. I think a lot of investors are discounting Amazon's position in the AI landscape and are underappreciating the potential upside the company could see in the long run. To me, the stock is a bargain, and I am aligned with Loeb's decision to scoop up shares.\n\n2. Alphabet: A rising star in the cloud\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google and YouTube. With the broad reach each of these has on the internet, it's not surprising that Alphabet's largest source of revenue is advertising.\n\nWhile the company is certainly a leader in online advertising, Alphabet does face some stiff competition from the likes of Meta Platforms and TikTok. And the advertising industry is cyclical and can be unreliable.\n\nOne way that Alphabet is responding is through its competitive advantage: data. It owns one of the biggest libraries of consumer search trends, a huge asset that it can use to train its large language model, called Gemini.\n\nThe pace at which Gemini can be trained is also important. As Google and YouTube remain dominant forces online, Alphabet is strongly positioned to store, analyze, and process myriad data sets to hone Gemini and create more products and services.\n\nOne area where Alphabet is already demonstrating some impressive growth is in cloud computing. Google Cloud Platform is Alphabet's fastest growing business and is already generating operating profits.\n\nAs with Amazon, I wouldn't sleep on Alphabet's potential to become a strong force in AI. The company is building a full-spectrum AI business, spanning workplace productivity tools, cloud computing, e-commerce, consumer search, and more.\n\nAt a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.3, the stock trades at a discount to each of its Magnificent Seven peers except Meta. To me, Alphabet shares look dirt cheap, and I think long-term investors will enjoy market-beating returns as AI continues to play a big role in the company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "U.S. technology equities continue to be on a tear in the second quarter. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has risen by roughly 13% year-to-date. If macroeconomic indicators exhibit signs of recovery from persistent inflation, U.S. equities could extend their rally. In this situation, software stocks are even better poised for significant gains. The artificial intelligence craze has influenced tech stocks since early last year and will probably do so for the time being. Software firms have scrambled to employ AI technologies in their products and have assured investors of the long-term benefits of artificial intelligence for their respective platforms.\n\nThe software stocks below are involved in various sub-verticals of the space, and their exposure to AI will help their shares surge 5X over the next five years.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) makes the initial entry on this software stocks to buy list. The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new era for remote working and a surge in demand for cloud computing services. With a plethora of data flowing through data centers, cloud services have required a host of new cybersecurity tools. That’s where CrowdStrike comes in. The cybersecurity firm offers a comprehensive suite of solutions for endpoint security and vulnerability management (VM). These technologies help to secure “endpoints,” such as laptops, phones, and desktops, while also deploying threat-detection capabilities to ameliorate a breach before it becomes severe.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite concerns about the macroeconomic environment, CrowdStrike has continued to increase sales with robust, double-digit growth figures. Similarly, in their Q4 FY2024 earnings report, CrowdStrike reported annual recurring revenue (ARR) Y/Y growth of 34% to $3.44 billion. The firm’s Falcon platform, which leverages AI to identify and neutralize threats as well as offers an AI security analyst chatbot named Charlotte AI, will likely gain more traction as demand for AI cybersecurity services increases.\n\nCRWD shares have rallied nearly 40% since the start of the year.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a data analytics firm that has gained traction with a number of defense industry-related companies over the years. Last year, Palantir reported its first profitable year, generating $209.8 million in net income. Better operational efficiencies coupled with higher demand for AI products helped the platform to finally reach bottom-line profitability. I’ve noted in prior articles about Palantir that its AI Platform was most likely a lot of hype. Based on Palantir’s trimmed guidance after their Q1 2024 report, that idea seems less far-fetched.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile there may be a lot of AI hype driving Palantir’s shares, it doesn’t mean the data analytics firm’s platform will not gain traction in the future. Palantir continues to successfully market the AI Platform to prospective users, and with an increasingly diverse base of customers, the platform will gain traction. This makes Palantir a good long-term bet for investors seeking compelling returns in the next five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for tech heavy-weight Google. From providing a globally successful search engine and mobile operating system to providing cloud computing and AI services, Google is really setting itself up for continued success. The tech giant’s trading valuation multiple is only icing on the cake. GOOG trades at about 22.9x forward earnings, while the plurality of its competitors- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – are trading at relative premiums.\n\nIn the company’s Q1 2024 earnings report, Google Cloud solidified itself as the company’s profit growth engine, despite investors having held doubts about the platform’s long-term viability. Operating income for the cloud business segment came in at $900 million in Q1, increasing 3.7x on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe tech giant’s foray into AI could help boost Google Cloud’s sales growth and profitability in the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Dow Stocks Billionaire Investors Have Been Buying Hand Over Fist Since 2024 Began",
        "content": "This coming Sunday, May 26, will mark the 128th \"birthday\" for Wall Street's most iconic stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI).\n\nWhen the Dow was first introduced in 1896, it was comprised of 12 predominantly industrial companies. Today, it's a mix of 30 time-tested, multinational businesses from an assortment of sectors and industries.\n\nWhile the Dow Jones has historically been viewed as a home for mature businesses that deliver modest growth and a quarterly dividend, ongoing changes to the index have shifted its representation. Though some of its components absolutely fit the bill as predictable, low-volatility businesses with market-topping yields (e.g., Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble), growth stocks are now also a notable part of this ageless index.\n\nIn particular, companies involved in the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) are represented within the Dow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Dow Jones is home to companies benefiting from the artificial intelligence revolution\n\nIn its simplest form, AI relates to software and systems handling tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What gives AI such wide-ranging utility is the ability for these systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention (what's known as \"machine learning\"). Software and systems becoming more proficient at their tasks, and perhaps even learning new skills or tasks, suggests AI can alter the growth trajectory for nearly every sector and industry.\n\nAccording to analysts at PwC, artificial intelligence can add a jaw-dropping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. PwC estimates that $6.6 trillion of this benefit will come from increased productivity, with the remaining $9.1 trillion traced to various consumption-side effects.\n\nWall Street's smartest, most-successful money managers don't want to miss out on this trend -- and the latest round of Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows it.\n\nA 13F is a required quarterly filing for institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management that gives investors under-the-hood access to what Wall Street's top investors bought and sold in the latest quarter. The 13Fs filed with the SEC on May 15 (the last day to report trades made in the March-ended quarter) show that prominent billionaire investors have been buying two AI Dow stocks hand over fist since 2024 began.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock billionaire money managers can't stop buying is a company that was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in February. I'm talking about world-leading e-commerce company Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). During the first quarter, nine billionaires purchased shares, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAmazon is using AI in more ways than I can list. Some of the more prominent examples include AI being deployed to improve search functionality for its online marketplace, as well as generative AI solutions being leaned on by Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to tailor their message(s) to consumers.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its dominant e-commerce platform. Last year, Amazon accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales. But in spite of all the revenue it brings in from its online marketplace, e-commerce provides Amazon little in the way of operating cash flow or income.\n\nAmazon's bread-and-butter operating segments are AWS, subscription services, and advertising services.\n\nA strong argument can be made that nothing is more important to Amazon's success than the continued growth of AWS. Enterprise cloud spending is still fairly early in its ramp-up stage, and as of the March-ended quarter, AWS had surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. Since cloud-service margins are substantially higher than what's generated from online retail sales, AWS is typically responsible for more than half of Amazon's operating income each year.\n\nSubscription services is another rapidly growing segment for the company. In April 2021, then-CEO Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon had surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers. Not only has this figure likely risen since the company secured the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football, but perks that include free two-day shipping and access to the company's content library make it easy for Amazon to raise Prime subscription prices.\n\nLastly, Amazon's advertising services segment hasn't delivered a quarter of less than 20% sales growth in over two years. It's easy to maintain strong ad-pricing power when you draw more than 2 billion people to your site each month. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIntel\n\nThe second AI Dow stock that billionaire investors have been buying hand over fist since the beginning of the year is semiconductor juggernaut Intel(NASDAQ: INTC). Intel was added to the Dow back in November 1999.\n\nDuring the first quarter, six top-tier billionaires purchased shares of Intel -- seven, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (4,836,516 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,757,626 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (1,345,269 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (413,507 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (411,473 shares)\n\nAlthough Intel is best known for its legacy hardware, such as central processing units (CPUs) used in personal computers (PCs), it's a company that very much has AI at the forefront of its growth strategy. For instance, Intel has been incorporating AI optimizations into its advanced developer tools, such as oneAPI and its deep-learning OpenVINO toolkit, to help clients using its hardware build, optimize, and deploy their AI solutions.\n\nIntel is also rolling out its Gaudi3 AI accelerator this year. Gaudi3 is a graphics processing unit (GPU) designed to go head-to-head with the current infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution, Nvidia. AI-GPUs are effectively the \"brains\" that allow for rapid computation in AI-accelerated data centers, and there's been a big-time shortage of these chips for more than a year.\n\nBeyond its AI ambitions, billionaires might be attracted to Intel as a bounce-back candidate following a couple of years of weakness in PC sales. Despite losing some of its CPU market share in PCs and data centers to chief rival Advanced Micro Devices, Intel still holds the bulk of CPU market share in these categories. While these may not be rapidly growing segments anymore, they deliver abundant operating cash flow that Intel can repurpose in higher-growth initiatives.\n\nAside from AI, one of these \"higher-growth initiatives\" is its Foundry Services segment. Building its foundry operations from the ground up to mass production is a costly procedure that's currently weighing on Intel's bottom line. But by the end of the decade, new chip fabrication facilities in Ohio and Germany have the potential to lift Intel to No. 2 in global foundry services share.\n\nLastly, Intel's valuation may be compelling to billionaires. Wall Street's consensus calls for Intel to more than triple its earnings per share (EPS) from a reported $1.05 in 2023 to an estimated $3.47 by 2027. When coupled with an S&P 500-topping yield of 1.6%, Intel has a value proposition to offer its patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement",
        "content": "Alongside its latest earnings results, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10:1 stock split and a 150% dividend raise following the market closed on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia shares, now the ninth most expensive in the S&P 500, opened above $1,000 a day after the print. A 10:1 split would imply a $100/share price, all else being equal, after trading opens on Monday, June 10th.\n\nThis year, eight companies announced stock splits, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in January and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) in March. The surge in Big Tech share prices prompted four splits among the ‘Magnificent 7’ mega-cap stocks since 2022, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making shares more accessible. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) split in 2020, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are nearing the $500/share threshold.\n\n“S&P 500 stocks with share prices over $500 represent $7.4tn in market cap, or about 16% of the index,” Bank of America analysts said in a Thursday note.\n\nIn their recently updated research, BofA found that stock splits are typically bullish for companies that enact them. On average, returns one year post-split are 25%, compared to around 12% for the broader market.\n\n“Splits seem to be bullish across market regimes, something management teams might consider if shares look too expensive for buybacks,” analysts wrote.\n\nWhen comparing the distribution of stock split returns relative to the S&P 500, it can be seen that a few strong companies often improve average performance. For instance, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) gained 56% in the 12 months following its October 2022 split announcement, while Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) rose 39% after declaring its split in August 2022, BofA highlighted.\n\nGiven that gains are more common and typically larger than losses, stock splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets. For example, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Valero experienced strong performance after their split announcements, regardless of their prior trading behavior.\n\nHowever, outperformance is not guaranteed, BofA’s team cautions. Roughly 30% of stocks see negative returns 12 months post-split, with an average decline of 22%. While splits may indicate strong momentum, companies can still struggle in a challenging macro environment.\n\n“Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked. Amazon is a good example of how stocks can recover, however, and was up 26% in the 24 months after its split announcement,” the firm noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent NVDA shareholders will receive 10 shares for every share they own today, while the market capitalization of the AI giant will remain unchanged.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement\n\nExclusive-KKR set for unconditional EU antitrust okay for Telecom Italia deal, sources say\n\nWorkday shares dive 12% on lowered subscription revenue outlook\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia's First Quarter Results Confirm That The Next Industrial Revolution Is Well Underway\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported its fiscal first quarter results, surpassing both top and bottom-line estimates as demand for AI chips remains as robust as ever. Nvidia sales continue to skyrocket as Google, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft-backed OpenAI spend billions of dollars to buy its graphics processing units to develop and deploy generative AI applications. During extended trading on Wednesday, Nvidia shares rose 7% and surpassed $1,000 for the first time.\n\nImpressive Fiscal First Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 28th, Nvidia reported that revenue grew262% YoY as it amounted to $26.04 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $24.65 billion. Data center alone reported a revenue rise of 427% YoY to $22.6 billion, with large cloud providers like Google, Microsoft and Amazon contributing about mid-40%. Meta Platforms and its announcement of Lama 3, their latest large language model which used 24,000 H100 GPUs, was the highlight of Nvidia’s reported quarter.\n\nNetworking revenue grew more than three times compared to last year’s comparable quarter to $3.2 billion, owed primarily to InfiniBand products. Gaming revenue grew 18% to $2.65 billion.Although a much smaller business, Nvidia also makes chips for cars and advanced graphics workstations. Professional visualization brought in $427 million with $329 million in automotive sales.\n\nNet income amounted to $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share, skyrocketing from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $2 billion.\n\nAn Even More Impressive Outlook\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for sales of $28 billion. Later this year, Nvidia expects even more revenue growth from its next-generation AI chip, with Blackwell expected to unlock a new growth phase for the AI chip leader. Financial Times reported earlier this week Amazon is eagerly waiting for Nvidia's newest superchip.\n\nNvidia expected a blockbuster quarter and it was just as impressive as anticipated. Although Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all stated that they intend to be less reliant on Nvidia’s chips as they plan to spend $200 billion this year on chips and data centers they need to train and operate their AI systems, they are not there year. Nvidia’s results have become the most important event on the macroeconomic calendar. It’s no exaggeration to say that its quarterly reports have become an indicator of strength of the AI boom that is not showing any signs of slowing down as AI seems to be the new commodity, marking a new era and the next industrial revolution. The new AI era began with Nvidia and by the looks of it, it is just getting started as CEO Jensen Huang assured that demand for both Hopper and Blackwell is way ahead of supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Amazon readies Alexa for its second act—but it has an uphill battle",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\n\nBefore ChatGPT could talk, there was Alexa. The decade-old Amazon voice assistant, however, never fully delivered on its potential and was useful for little more than setting a kitchen timer or telling you the weather.\n\nBut now with the full force of generative AI at its disposal, Amazon is looking toward Alexa’s second act. Sometime this year, the company plans to launch an overhauled, “more conversational” version of Alexa, sources told CNBC. Along with new and improved generative AI-powered capabilities, Amazon also plans to introduce a new business model for Alexa. Rather than be included with the company’s Prime subscription, Alexa will require its own monthly subscription.\n\nWhile Alexa has previously dominated voice assistant competitors, including Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant, the recent steady release of powerful generative AI-powered chatbots has made clear this space is newly up for grabs. Amazon has already sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, according to Amazon, which could give the company a leg up.\n\nAt the same time, Amazon hasn’t exactly shown itself to be an AI disrupter—the company is certainly supporting the AI boom via Amazon Web Services and has hitched its wagon to AI startup Anthropic by investing billions of dollars in it, but it hasn’t released any leading AI models that would put it in the same realm as OpenAI, Google, or Meta.\n\nA generative AI-powered Alexa could be Amazon’s opportunity to finally get in on the AI boom, not to mention finally deliver on the true vision of Alexa. But it faces real challenges: its own lagging position in AI, technical hurdles and runaway compute costs still plaguing the industry, and fierce competition from other tech giants that are all vying to deliver the best AI assistant experience.\n\nDespite the recent controversy around the Scarlett Johansson-esque voice for ChatGPT, OpenAI put a stake in the ground with its demo of the latest version of its product last week. Google has also rolled out voice support for its Gemini model. And next month at its annual developers conference, Apple is expected to unveil a new generative AI-powered, more conversational Siri. Apple faces many of the same challenges as Amazon in terms of its AI position, but the company is reportedly negotiating with Google to bring its leading Gemini model to the iPhone.\n\n“A lot of us have had this vision for what a powerful assistant can be, but we were held back by the underlying technology not being able to serve that goal,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the Decoder podcast this week. “I think we have a technology that is better able to serve that. That’s why you’re seeing the progress again. I think that’s exciting.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf these products succeed, they could completely change how we interact with technology, get information, organize our lives, and use products and services. The New York Times reported that Apple executives worry new AI technology could displace its iPhone’s iOS software and threaten its dominance over the smartphone market. With an ecosystem of AI agents, we may no longer need apps or the app store.\n\nThat’s the exact future wearable maker Humane was betting on with its Ai Pin, though it’s clear we’re still quite a ways off. The Ai Pin was designed to speak out loud to people wearing it and handle many of the same tasks as Alexa and Siri, but it failed to deliver. Gadget reviewer Marques Brownlee dubbed it “the worst product I’ve ever reviewed…for now”, and yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Humane is seeking to be acquired after the product’s rocky launch.\n\nThe dream of finally delivering a true AI assistant feels closer than ever before, and at the same time, still very far away. In OpenAI’s demo last week, Sky very much sounded like a real person—both in terms of its voice and how it answered questions (and as always, it’s important to remember that we can only trust a demo so much). But sounding like a real person is only half the battle. These models are still limited by the fact that they’re confidently wrong all the time. As I continue to test ChatGPT, I am floored by how consistently wrong it is. I feel like I can’t trust a word it says.\n\n“I wonder if the intelligence is increasing at the same rate as the facility with language,” Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, said to Pichai during the Decoder conversation. “I kind of don’t see it, to be perfectly honest. I see computers getting much better at language and actually in some cases getting dumber.”\n\nAnd with that, here’s more AI news.\n\nSage Lazzaro\r\nsage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\r\nsagelazzaro.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia CEO says Tesla 'far ahead' in self-driving tech as autonomous driving efforts boost chip demand",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang believes Tesla’s (TSLA) full self-driving (FSD) system is the most advanced system out right now. It also just so happens that Tesla’s FSD is powered by Nvidia's chips.\n\n“Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,” Huang said in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"One of the things that's really revolutionary about version 12 of Tesla's full self-driving is that it's an end-to-end generative model,\" Huang added.\n\n\"It learns from watching videos — surround video — and it learns about how to drive end-to-end, and using generative AI, predict the path and how to understand and how to steer the car. So the technology is really revolutionary and the work that [Tesla’s] doing is incredible.\"\n\nTesla's latest FSD, version 12, is currently in beta mode and was rolled out in 30-day free trials to new owners earlier this year. FSD currently costs $99 a month or $8,000 up-front. Tesla reported in April that FSD had over 1.3 billion cumulative miles driven since its debut in March 2021.\n\nFSD is still considered a Level 2 autonomous system, meaning it requires supervised use, and has been subject to recalls and government inquiries into its capabilities. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang displays products onstage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported automotive revenue of $329 million, a small sliver of the $22.6 billion in its data center business but up 17% sequentially and up 11% year over year.\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the company’s earnings call she expects automotive to be the “largest enterprise vertical within [the] Data Center [segment] this year,” and a potential multibillion-dollar business for the company.\n\nMost of Nvidia's Data Center revenue, which tallied $22.6 billion the first quarter, came from consumer internet customers. Cloud providers, or the so-called hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), accounted for a \"mid-40s percentage\" of this segment's revenue.\n\nHuang also told Yahoo Finance he expects one day \"every single car\" will have some level of autonomous ability — a development that will require huge amounts of computing power.\n\n“This technology is very similar to the technology of large language models, but it requires just an enormous training facility,\" Huang said, referring to Tesla's FSD system. \"And the reason for that is because there's videos, the data rate of video, the amount of data of video is so, so high.\"\n\nFor example, in order to boost Tesla’s ability to process that amount of data, Nvidia said it helped the company expand its FSD training AI cluster to 35,000 Nvidia Hopper H100 GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Nvidia's other automotive sector clients include Mercedes, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Hyundai, as well as Chinese EV upstarts like BYD (BYD) and NIO (NIO).\n\nWall Street is also bullish on Nvidia’s automotive business.\n\nIn a note published Thursday, analysts at JPMorgan boosted their Nvidia price target to $1,150 from $850, modeling the chipmaker’s data center business with a 20-30% annual growth rate with Nvidia monetizing \"an incremental ~$14 billion of auto revenue pipeline\" over the next three to four years.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024",
        "content": "It is the unofficial kickoff to summer this weekend. Millions of Americans are expected to hit the road and fly the skies to enjoy warmer weather and get a break from the grind. We've seen just how popular many forms of in-person entertainment have been in the past year, so there's reason for optimism on the consumption front.\n\nRecall that about a year ago, the \"Taylor Swift Effect\" drove improved economic growth in certain regions (no joke, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said as much), and strong ratings and ticket sales have been seen for other artists and in live sports.[1] It doesn't hurt that, as of this writing, a pair of New York professional sports teams are making playoff runs too.\n\nBut not all entertainment venues have been welcoming boisterous crowds. So far in 2024, domestic gross box office sales are down 24% from year-ago levels through May 15, according to IMDbPro.[2] It comes as Hollywood struggles to put out popular blockbusters and as continued drama in the media-enterprise space casts a dark cloud over out-of-the-house entertainment.\n\nWeaker box office sales in 2024 Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024\n\nSource: Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro\n\nBundle-unbundle-rebundle\n\nInvestors and casual observers alike have surely read and heard about the ongoing drama at Disney (NYSE:DIS). All the while, families across the country have been forced to consider the steeply rising costs of subscription streaming services. Maybe just as frustrating for consumers, it seems the movies and entertainment industry is now pivoting from an a la carte sales model back to bundling, which has features of the old-school cable package.\n\nCorporate activity\n\nThere has been no break in the action this year with so many moving pieces and a reshuffling of the media playing field. It was just a handful of months ago when Lionsgate Studio spun off from Starz. The new entity, Lionsgate Studios Corp. (LFG.A), focuses on film and TV. Then in May, shares of Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) fell on a report that Sony was rethinking its $26 billion bid for the company.[3] The latest whisper is that Paramount and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may partner up.[4]\n\nNetflix pounces on new opportunities\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, continues to venture further into sports, inking a three-year deal with the NFL to stream a set of games each season.[5] It also plans to launch an in-house advertising technology platform to further diversify its revenue sources.[6] The Communication Services stalwart may not be grouped with the Magnificent Seven heavyweights, but shares are up more than 25% in 2024.[7] Boasting a highly profitable ad-supported tier, with a total subscriber base of 40 million customers, up five million from a year ago, consumers just keep chillin'.[8]\n\nStory continues\n\n2021 social media favorites come roaring back\n\nAnd how can we not offer a nod to meme-stock mania Part III? Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC) have gone bananas in recent weeks, all prompted by a single picture posted to X by @TheRoaringKitty earlier this month.[9] Of course, the social-trading frenzy has little to do with fundamentals in the movie market, but the saga is worthy of sitting back with a bowl of popcorn and seeing what unfolds.\n\nFeature films\n\nBut let's aim the spotlight at the movie scene as the summer months inch closer. Our data show that, as has become the norm, Netflix dominates the movie-release count from mid-May through the Labor Day weekend. Nineteen major motion pictures are slated to be released. Sony Pictures Studios is runner-up with 13 movies set to hit the domestic box office.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN continues to ride on its robust cloud computing arm — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). The solid customer momentum of AWS is driving the company’s top line. Shares of Amazon have rallied 20.4% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s growth of 12.7%.\r\n\r\nThe latest partnership of a generative AI company called NinjaTech AI with AWS is a testament to the above-mentioned fact.\r\n\r\nThe former launched the next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using AWS’s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nApart from these next-generation chips, NinjaTech AI is leveraging Amazon SageMaker in a bid to make training of the underlined AI agents fast, flexible and affordable.\r\n\r\nWith the help of AWS cloud solutions, Ninja is capable of saving time and money by implementing generative AI in everyday workflows.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAWS’s Portfolio Strength: A Key Catalyst\n\nNinjaTech AI’s latest move highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS’s innovative cloud products and services. Moreover, it has added strength to AWS’s customer base.\r\n\r\nBoth Trainium and Inferentia2 chips are designed to support the larger 70B variants of the latest popular open-source models like Llama 3. While Trainium chips help train Large Language Models at low costs by powering high-performance compute clusters on AWS, Inferentia2 chips enable models to generate inferences faster and at much lower costs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these chips, AWS recently introduced Amazon Bedrock innovations in order to bolster generative AI strength. These innovations include the latest custom model import capability and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails, which are designed to deliver easy, fast and secure ways to develop advanced generative AI applications and experiences.\r\n\r\nAWS also made its generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q generally available.\r\n\r\nAWS’s growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings are likely to continue driving customer momentum. This, in turn, will continue to drive AWS’s top-line growth in the near term and the long run.\r\n\r\nIn first-quarter 2024, AWS sales (18% of the total sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the AWS segment, in turn, will boost Amazon’s overall financial performance.\r\n\r\nFor second-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $148.54 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.5%.\r\n\r\nThe same for earnings per share stands at $1.02, which indicates a year-over-year rise of 61.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nRising Competition\n\nAmazon’s solidifying prospects in the promising cloud computing market are expected to continue providing a competitive advantage over its peers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, which are also gaining steam.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is continuously riding on strong momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business, driven by the solid adoption of Azure. Strength in Azure AI remains a positive. The company’s strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI are noteworthy. Also, growth in AI Copilot is contributing well to Microsoft’s cloud business.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud, which has turned out to be the key catalyst for Alphabet’s growth, is gaining from the growing generative AI capabilities, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace remains a major positive.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Salesforce CRM, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nShares of Salesforce have gained 8.3% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for CRM is 17.45%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "The Justice Department is widening its antitrust crackdown as it goes after Live Nation (LYV), filing a lawsuit Thursday that seeks a breakup of the entertainment giant.\n\nUS prosecutors and a group of states argue that Live Nation used its Ticketmaster ticketing monopoly to suppress competition. The lawsuit follows a two-year investigation into the company.\n\nThe suit comes 14 years after DOJ approved a merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster is a dominant provider of ticket sales across the US that processes more than 80% of sales, while Live Nation owns and operates hundreds of high-profile venues and is a giant concert promoter.\n\nThe combined company has long faced criticism of what lawmakers and regulators consider to be exorbitant fees, problematic customer service and unfair practices.\n\nLive Nation’s stock was down roughly 5% as the suit was filed in the Southern District of New York.\n\n\"Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, cited by multiple media outlets.\n\n\"The result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts, smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices for ticketing services,\" Garland added. \"It is time to break up Live Nation.\"\n\nLive Nation immediately refuted the lawsuit, calling the allegations \"baseless.\"\n\n\"The DOJ’s complaint attempts to portray Live Nation and Ticketmaster as the cause of fan frustration with the live entertainment industry,\" said Dan Wall, Live Nation executive vice president for corporate and regulatory affairs.\n\n\"It blames concert promoters and ticketing companies—neither of which control ticket prices—for high ticket prices. It ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from increasing production costs to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary tickets cost.\"\n\nThe new legal action is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nThe administration has alleged antitrust violations by tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), while taking to trial a case filed by the Trump administration against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also trying to block mergers that could eliminate competition in other industries. Joe Berchtold, president and CFO of Live Nation Entertainment, testified before a Senate committee in January 2023, in the wake of problems surrounding access to ticket purchases for Taylor Swift performances. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Win McNamee via Getty Images)\n\nSince the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was approved in 2010, the company has been at the center of antitrust concerns, with critics taking aim at sky-high ticket fees and accusing the entertainment giant of anti-competitive behavior.\n\nIn 2020, the Justice Department updated the company's consent decree, an agreement which barred Live Nation from strong-arming venues into using Ticketmaster for its tours, and extended it until 2025.\n\nIt did so after it said it found evidence the company repeatedly and over the course of several years engaged in conduct that violated its earlier agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Capitol Hill ramped up its fight against Live Nation during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at the start of last year following a 2022 fiasco with Taylor Swift concert tickets.\n\nTicketmaster's online software struggled to handle the demand for presale orders and fans complained they were denied tickets as they tried to buy.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nAt the time, multiple senators called for a breakup of the company, although some Wall Street analysts have argued a breakup wouldn't necessarily solve the problems surrounding the unregulated secondary ticket market.\n\nAnalysts have also said Live Nation would be a \"shell of itself\" without Ticketmaster as that entity makes up the bulk of the profits.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, the company saw its fiscal year 2023 revenue surge 36% year over year to $22.7 billion, while its earnings per share more than doubled to $1.37. Concert attendance climbed 20% as over 145 million fans attended over 50,000 events.\n\nAnalyst Matthew Harrigan sees a DOJ lawsuit against Live Nation as being \"significantly politicized\" amid the US election year, and says the department \"has been generally unsuccessful in applying horizontal M&A theories.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that any targeted unwinding of the 2010 Live Nation Ticketmaster merger likely has only a remote likelihood under accepted antitrust law although we would be wary of the likely initial New York State Federal Court venue,\" he said.\n\nDeutsche Bank, meanwhile, said \"the pursuit of a breakup of Live Nation by the DOJ is somewhat surprising, and raises the stakes of the investigation.\"\n\n\"We would anticipate that Live Nation plans to defend its position in court, and could still win, but this issue is likely to remain an overhang for some time,\" the bank added, noting a possible drag on the stock price.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), while the Federal Trade Commission is pushing for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). to divest its Instagram and WhatsApp units and has sued Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for monopolistic practices in the online marketplace.\n\nFollowing the news of the impending lawsuit, Live Nation’s shares fell, highlighting investor concerns over the potential outcomes of the legal action.\n\nLive Nation, the largest concert promoter in the United States, merged with Ticketmaster in 2010. The merger was initially approved under the Obama administration with conditions designed to prevent anticompetitive practices.\n\nHowever, under the Trump administration, the Justice Department found that Live Nation had violated these conditions, leading to a modified settlement in 2019 that included the appointment of an external monitor to oversee compliance.\n\nThe Biden administration launched a new investigation into Live Nation in 2022, prompted by ongoing concerns about the company’s adherence to the settlement terms.\n\nPublic interest in the case surged after Ticketmaster struggled to handle the overwhelming demand for Taylor Swift concert tickets later that year, bringing further scrutiny to Live Nation’s practices.\n\nLive Nation stock has gained more than 23% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Invesco S&P 500 Pure Growth ETF (NYSE:RPG) and First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXD).\n\nPrice Action: LYV shares are trading lower by 6.11% at $95.20 in the premarket at the last check on Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto via Midjourney\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nLIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT (LYV): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Why Ticketmaster Owner Live Nation's Shares Are Tumbling Today originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Investors traditionally favored mega-cap tech giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for their artificial intelligence (AI) investments. That makes sense, just given the kind of run Nvidia has been on of late.\n\nHowever, overlooked AI stocks hold tremendous potential for even greater gains than some of these heavily-covered stocks. These companies may carry as much upside from this technology. But that value isn’t likely getting priced into their respective stock prices.\n\nFinding these overlooked AI stocks isn’t easy. And in some respects, the names on this list aren’t entirely overlooked. There’s a strong AI thesis many investors are already aware of for these stocks, but it’s not their primary story. A portion of investors focus less on AI and more on the other fantastic business units driving revenue and profitability growth for these giants.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNonetheless, these stocks have big AI potential. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL), a global software company, capitalizes on AI demand with its Gen2 cloud infrastructure, essential for processing complex AI workloads. Despite its overshadowing, Oracle’s role in AI infrastructure is gaining recognition, especially with plans for 100 new data centers. With a $20 billion cloud business, Oracle’s AI-driven growth potential is just emerging.\n\nIn other Oracle news, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Oracle deepened their 30-year partnership, investing in generative AI solutions to drive growth and innovation. Leveraging Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), these two partners are looking to empower businesses with real-time data analysis for large-scale transformations.\n\nMoreover, Choice Hotels International, a global lodging franchisor, partnered with Oracle Hospitality to deploy Oracle Nor1, an AI-powered merchandising solution. This implementation aimed to boost revenue and enhance guest experiences through personalized services and offers. Oracle Nor1 utilized AI to deliver tailored offers via mobile apps and digital channels, optimizing conversion rates.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced additional rounds of layoffs lately, the company remains a top stock to buy. The firm’s Q1 saw Amazon report a 13% increase in net sales and a tripling of net income year-over-year (YOY). AMZN’s online marketplace remains their key revenue driver. Additionally, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising segments are gaining traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Amazon is seeing impressive sales and net income profit over the years despite inflation surge. However, recent challenges from inflation have impacted e-commerce and cloud sales. Nevertheless, Amazon adapted by optimizing its cost structure and transitioning to a regional fulfillment model, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nA $9 billion investment in Singapore for cloud computing underscores its commitment to regional expansion. This move followed Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) lead in Southeast Asia. Also, Amazon is continuing to increase its focus on generative AI, including ChatGPT and Amazon Bedrock. And this is strengthening its core capabilities and enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nThese factors and a 21% year-to-date (YTD) stock increase have led analysts to rate Amazon as a strong buy.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nCapitalizing and growing on AI trends, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is not only focusing in smartphones. The company has now a strong position that strengthens the demand that grows through the years. Moreover, through more AI-powered innovations, Q2 is set to show more growth.\n\nIts recent Snapdragon X Elite, which is based on an ARM chip, aims to offer more enhance performance and efficiency for computers. This includes M3-chip MacBooks and Windows laptops. These chips will be groundbreaking and are set to be released mid-2024. In other QCOM news, Ampere Computingannounced a partnership with Qualcomm to introduce a new solution to reduce power consumption for AI chips.\n\nFounded by former Intel president Renee James, Ampere utilizes Arm Holdings technology to produce energy-efficient central processing chips used by Oracle, Google and more. The startup prioritizes energy efficiency over industry leaders like Intel and AMD.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Whoa! HPE Stock Is the Top Tech Pick You Didn’t See Coming.",
        "content": "Here’s a technology-stock pick that’s totally out of left field, but it could be a major wealth builder. I’m talking about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), a fast mover in the areas of cloud computing and supercomputers. Soon enough, Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock could be the market’s next multibagger that nobody saw coming.\n\nJust to be clear, the electronics producer formerly known as Hewlett-Packard split in late 2015 into two separate businesses. This “enterprise” company provides technology solutions primarily for businesses. In contrast, HP (NYSE:HPQ) mainly sells personal computers and printers.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise isn’t a Magnificent Seven member, but as we’ll see, the company offers magnificent value to its shareholders. So, let’s jump right in and see what this underappreciated technology firm has been up to lately.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise: A Supercomputer Superstar\n\nUnlike HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise isn’t heavily affected by the ups and downs of the PC market. As long as there’s a demand for cloud storage, Hewlett Packard Enterprise should be positioned to generate robust revenue.\n\nOn that topic, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recently unveiled HPE GreenLake Block Storage for Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services. Hewlett Packard Enterprise describes this service as “a new software-defined storage offering to manage block storage across hybrid cloud environments.”\n\nWorking with the almighty Amazon is great, and the only thing that might be better is partnering with the U.S. government. Specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recently delivered a supercomputer to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nIt’s not the first time Hewlett Packard Enterprise has delivered a supercomputer to the Energy Department. However, this new supercomputer could make the older ones instantly obsolete. As Hewlett Packard Enterprise explains, it’s the “largest deployment of open, Ethernet-based supercomputing interconnect – HPE Slingshot – on a single system.”\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Delivers Supreme Value\n\nSome Magnificent Seven companies are richly valued and offer a small dividend or no dividend at all. An example would be Amazon, which doesn’t pay a dividend and has a GAAP-measured trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 51.53x.\n\nIn contrast, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a P/E ratio of just 12.32x. So, as long as HPE stock is under $20 per share, I’d say it’s a bargain. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t buy Amazon stock. Rather, I’m only suggesting that you might want to expand your horizons beyond the Magnificent Seven.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Hewlett Packard Enterprise offers a forward annual dividend yield of 2.83%, which easily exceeds the technology-sector average yield of 1.025%. Moreover, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s dividends appear to be quite safe.\n\nThe company is consistently profitable and has a good track record of beating analysts’ consensus quarterly EPS forecasts.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Stock: A Great Deal From Left Field\n\nChances are, you didn’t expect Hewlett Packard Enterprise to be such a strong contender among top-tier technology firms. Truly, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has what it takes to compete successfully in the fields of cloud storage and supercomputers in the coming quarters.\n\nBesides, Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares aren’t overpriced at all, and the company rewards its investors with generous quarterly dividends. Therefore, I encourage you to add Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock to your portfolio while it’s still a relatively undiscovered tech-market pick.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "If the market’s dramatic shifts this year have left you feeling unsettled, you’re not alone. Despite widespread overvaluation in many tech stocks, plenty of blue-chip stocks to buy can provide the portfolio stability we all need.\n\nDuring the current rally, stocks have risen, plummeted, and risen again, pushing investors toward small-caps, tech, and growth stocks. While profitable, this strategy might not be the best long-term decision if you’re seeking continued growth alongside general stock stability, avoiding the rapid stock price swings we’ve been seeing. Instead, these blue-chip stocks to buy offer a firm foundation of long-term opportunity to anchor your portfolio.\n\nThe economic landscape remains uncertain, with inflation stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target, creating general unease and uncertainty about short-term economic conditions. One adverse event, economic or otherwise, could send speculative stocks tumbling again. With this in mind, these blue-chip stocks to buy offer stability, value, and diversification to protect yourself against the worst fallout if (or when) the market takes another hit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltria (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) may trade well below pre-pandemic highs, but its hefty dividend yield and current momentum make it a blue-chip investor’s dream. The company’s current dividend yield is an impressive 9.56%, which is particularly enticing as high bond yields make fixed-income investing increasingly central to well-rounded portfolios.\n\nRecent earnings reports show that the company is on solid financial footing, ensuring upside potential while maintaining its substantial dividend distribution. Despite declining smoking rates, Altria’s diluted earnings per share grew by 21% over the quarter.\n\nSimultaneously, Altria is aggressively exploring smokeless alternatives. Adaptation is crucial for any company, but especially for Altria, which relies heavily on tobacco sales. Altria is also getting ahead of regulatory criticism by developing a first-of-its-kind Bluetooth-enabled tool to restrict underage use of smokeless tobacco products. If Altria successfully transitions into the smokeless nicotine market, it could solidify its position as the leading blue-chip stock in the wider industry.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Medtronic (MDT)\n\nThe medical stock sector experienced dramatic fluctuations during the pandemic, leaving many investors wary. Companies saw significant stock surges followed by steep declines, casting a shadow over the entire industry. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), a major player in the field, wasn’t immune to these trends, with its market capitalization nearly half what it was mid-pandemic. However, recent signs point to a strong recovery, and its 3.5% dividend yield keeps investors content while they wait for the rebound.\n\nStory continues\n\nMedtronic’s strong dividend program is particularly noteworthy in the current context. The company has a nearly 50-year history of consistently increasing its annual dividend, demonstrating a stable commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nBeyond its financials, Medtronic’s role in the medical device industry is significant. Known for its innovation and development in medical technology, the company is now focusing on more collaborative and risk-based contracting with hospital networks. These agreements aim to enhance patient outcomes and reduce costs, making Medtronic a valuable partner in an era of escalating healthcare delivery costs. Additionally, ongoing partnerships with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) keep Medtronic at the forefront of emerging health tech trends, solidifying its position as a top blue-chip stock to buy today.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for traditional oil and energy firms to add to your “blue-chip stocks to buy” list, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is a perfect choice. Warren Buffett loves the stock; Buffett’s endorsement is proof enough to sway even the most skeptical investor. However, if you need more of a push to consider this blue-chip stock, recent news may mark massive upside ahead for Occidental Petroleum.\n\nLast year, Occidental Petroleum cemented its position as a sustainability-centric oil stock, as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a new partnership with a subsidiary to leverage emerging carbon capture technology. Analysts anticipate this collaboration could add up to $150 million to Amazon’s revenue by helping the retailer reduce its carbon footprint through a new direct air capture plant.\n\nThis facility is one of the first of its kind, made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s $3.5 billion allocation for plant development. This initiative allows OXY to diversify its revenue streams as more corporate entities seek ways to offset their carbon emissions. As demand for sustainability continues to grow, traditional oil and gas companies must adapt. OXY stands out as one of the first blue-chip stocks in the sector to proactively embrace this trend.\n\nOXY’s overall trailing yield is a respectable 2.75%. Warren Buffett’s endorsement of the stock is a positive signal for investors, and the company’s prospects moving forward look equally promising.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Costco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few companies with unstoppable momentum amid wider economic conditions. It has grown almost 24% since January and a remarkable 225% over the past five years. Though consumers increasingly manage grocery budgets more tightly, Costco remains top-of-mind for many shoppers today.\n\nThe shift in consumer behavior is evident as shoppers have reduced spending on non-essential items while maintaining consistent purchases of essential products at Costco. Though the company’s exceptional growth during the pandemic creates a challenging baseline for ongoing expansion, management seems well-positioned to maintain momentum.\n\nAdditionally, Costco still has room to grow and untapped potential globally. Membership is rapidly growing despite the year’s economic turbulence. Management’s sensitivity to consumer and customer needs increases brand loyalty. Although activist investors have called for membership price hikes, the Chief Financial Officer has pointed to inflation and household concerns as reasons to stabilize pricing. Costco’s growth amid uncertainty and strong brand loyalty make it a consumer mainstay. It’s also a perfect blue-chip stock to buy if you want to protect your portfolio.\n\nJazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) Image of the Jazz Pharmaceuticals logo on a sign\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to capture current cannabis trends but are understandably sketched out by speculative cannabis stocks, Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) is a promising blue-chip alternative. This blue-chip stock offers the stability of a legacy pharmaceutical company with one foot firmly in the medical cannabis sector. Better yet, Jazz is undergirded by a strong foundational series of treatments and medication, with the company’s daytime sleepiness and narcolepsy therapeutic, Xywav, remaining a strong performer that accounts for up to 10% of total sales. These legacy pharma initiatives provide stability as the company explores the emerging medical cannabis market driven by recent rescheduling news.\n\nJazz is set to explode as markets realize the implications of medical cannabis rescheduling, thanks to its subsidiary GW Pharmaceuticals, one of the first companies to develop and commercialize medical cannabis. This puts Jazz near the top of the national medical cannabis market, unlike many pure-play cannabis stocks focused solely on branding and distribution. By focusing on high-level initiatives, Jazz is poised to dominate the (soon to be) rapidly growing medical cannabis sector to outpace late entrants, including well-established pharmaceutical companies reacting to rescheduling.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) often tops lists of dividend stocks to own forever, and it’s easy to see why. The company’s status as a dividend aristocrat, its monthly distributions, and a 5.75% yield make it a perennial favorite. After falling nearly 20% over the past year, this dividend stock is attractively priced for long-term investors. Realty Income’s inherent stock strength remains unchanged, making it a compelling buy for those looking to compound their investment.\n\nRealty Income boasts an impressive 98% occupancy rate across its properties, with 80% of retail tenants in sectors resilient to economic downturns. Many of these tenants are in the grocery sector, with convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores also making up a substantial part of its portfolio. This creates a robust mix that is immune to all but the most severe economic downturns.\n\nThe company’s triple-net lease model transfers all operational risks and expenses, including property maintenance costs, to the tenants. This structure effectively shields Realty Income from the rising material and labor costs often accompanying higher interest rates. Additionally, with leases typically lasting 15 years or more, complete with renewal options, Realty Income enjoys a steady stream of rental income. Realty’s current rent recapture rate is a staggering 104.3% today, creating foundational blue-chip stock stability.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen investors think of cheap blue-chip stocks, AT&T (NYSE:T) often tops the list. Despite dipping last summer due to concerns over lead shielding, shares are rebounding as the issue appears less severe than initially thought. Yet, shares remain undervalued, trading well below pre-pandemic highs, presenting an opportunity to benefit from a potential rise back to the top.\n\nWhile blue-chip stocks, particularly in the utilities sector, often lack the innovation seen in growth stocks, AT&T stands out. This week, the company made headlines by announcing a commercial partnership with AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) to provide space-based broadband cell connectivity to customers through 2030. Although the companies have collaborated since 2018 to bring this vision to life, this move marks a significant milestone in AT&T’s goal to expand its global network by leveraging next-gen space technology.\n\nAnother key feature of Wall Street’s favorite blue-chip stocks is their dividend yield, and AT&T is a longstanding favorite among income investors. With a current dividend yield of 6.55% and a 56% payout ratio, AT&T offers income, stability, and newfound growth opportunities through its strategic partnership with AST SpaceMobile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "2 Electric Vehicle (EV) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) market has gone through some wild swings over the past few years. Dozens of EV-related companies went public during the buying frenzy in growth and meme stocks in 2020 and 2021, but many of those stocks burned out in 2022 and 2023 as rising interest rates popped the speculative bubble.\n\nMany investors might want to shun all EV stocks after that wipeout, but there are still plenty of beaten-down plays that might skyrocket as the sector warms up again. Today, I'll take a closer look at two out-of-favor EV stocks that are still worth buying -- and one that you shouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole. Image source: Rivian.\n\nAn EV stock to buy: Rivian Automotive\n\nRivian(NASDAQ: RIVN) produces electric pickups, SUVs, and custom delivery vans for its top investor, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Unlike many other smaller EV makers that are struggling to ramp up their production, Rivian already produced 24,337 vehicles in 2022 and more than doubled its production to 57,232 vehicles in 2023.\n\nIt's also been installing its own in-house Enduro drive unit into more vehicles to reduce its production costs and dependence on third-party components. As a result, it expects its gross margin to finally turn positive by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nUnfortunately, Rivian's stock still declined more than 20% over the past 12 months after it predicted its production would flatline at about 57,000 vehicles in 2024. It attributed that slowdown to tougher macro headwinds, stiff competition from other EV makers, and the temporary shutdown of its main plant in Illinois for some technological upgrades.\n\nHowever, from 2023 to 2026, analysts still expect Rivian's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39% as it expands its production capabilities, rolls out its new R2 and R3 SUVs, and continues to deliver more vans to Amazon. It won't turn profitable anytime soon, but its stock looks dirt cheap at 2 times this year's sales.\n\nAn EV stock to buy: ChargePoint\n\nAnother underappreciated EV stock is ChargePoint (NYSE: CHPT), the largest builder of EV charging stations in North America and Europe. Its revenue soared 65% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in January 2022) and 94% in fiscal 2023 but rose just 8% in fiscal 2024.\n\nThat slowdown was caused by the cooling EV market, macro headwinds that prevented businesses from installing new charging stations, and persistent competition from Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Superchargers. Its gross margins also plunged as its revenue growth decelerated and its net losses widened. That's why ChargePoint's stock lost more than three-quarters of its value over the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, after that steep decline, ChargePoint's stock looks like a bargain at less than 2 times this year's sales. Its growth could accelerate significantly once the EV market stabilizes and the macro environment improves. It expects to resolve its inventory issues and scale up its manufacturing capabilities in Asia in the second half of 2024, and analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 21% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027.\n\nChargePoint isn't profitable yet, but it expects its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. It might be smart to buy its beaten-down stock before it reaches that milestone.\n\nAn EV stock to avoid: Lucid\n\nLucid(NASDAQ: LCID) is a maker of luxury electric sedans. It's led by Tesla's former chief vehicle engineer Peter Rawlinson, but it's struggling to ramp up its production. It originally claimed it could deliver 20,000 vehicles in 2022 and 49,000 vehicles in 2023 -- but it only delivered 4,369 vehicles in 2022 and 6,001 vehicles in 2023. It blamed that slower-than-expected growth on supply chain constraints, production delays, recalls, and the broader slowdown of the EV market.\n\nFor 2024, Lucid expects to deliver 9,000 vehicles. It plans to roll out its Gravity SUV, which was originally scheduled to launch in 2023, by the end of the year. However, it has also repeatedly slashed its prices over the past year to sell more vehicles.\n\nLucid's stock has already plummeted 60% over the past 12 months, but it still doesn't seem like a bargain at 9 times this year's sales. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 83% from 2023 to 2026, but I think those estimates could be too optimistic. The company isn't anywhere close to breaking even yet, and it's betting heavily on support from the Saudi Arabian government -- which owns more than 60% of its shares through its Public Investment Fund (PIF) -- to scale up its struggling business.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "You may not realize it, but last week marked one of the most important data releases of the quarter for investors -- and I'm not talking about the highly anticipated April inflation report.\n\nMay 15 was the deadline for institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows investors to look over the proverbial shoulders of Wall Street's greatest investors to see what they were buying and selling in the latest quarter (in this instance, the quarter ended in March).\n\nSince the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been credited with pushing the broad-market indexes to record highs, it's only logical to examine how Wall Street's smartest billionaire investors approached these companies in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm talking about seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country today, including:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhat these stocks share in common is a massive outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500 over the trailing-10-year period, along with well-defined competitive advantages. For instance, Alphabet's Google has maintained at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back nine years. Meanwhile, Apple has the most robust capital-return program on the planet among publicly traded companies. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it's repurchased $674 billion of its own stock. Buybacks of this magnitude can provide a hearty lift to earnings per share.\n\nHowever, billionaires have very different outlooks for these seven stocks. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, billionaires dumped shares of two Magnificent Seven stocks, while absolutely piling into another.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires sent to the chopping block: Nvidia\n\nThe first member of the Magnificent Seven that prominent billionaire investors seemingly wanted nothing to do with in the first quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia. Just as we witnessed during the fourth quarter, eight well-known billionaires were sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would billionaires sell what's arguably been the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street? Aside from simple profit-taking, there are a few potential red flags that Wall Street's brightest investors may be focusing on.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia is set to face increased competition from all angles. Although it's well publicized that external competitors will be vying for graphics processing unit (GPU) market share in AI-accelerated data centers this year, the bigger threat may come from Nvidia's own top customers.\n\nInterestingly, Magnificent Seven components Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four top customers -- about 40% of net sales. Each of these companies is developing their own AI-GPUs to deploy in collaboration with Nvidia's H100 GPUs in their high-compute data centers. The internal development of AI-GPUs from other Magnificent Seven businesses strongly suggests that we're witnessing a peak in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nHistory has also been incredibly unkind to next-big-thing investment trends. Over the last three decades, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation or trend that didn't undergo a bubble-bursting event fairly early into its existence. Investors commonly overestimate the uptake and enterprise adoption of new technologies, which leads to bubbles. If the artificial intelligence bubble were to follow history and burst, no company would be hit harder than Nvidia, which saw its sales more than double last year because of AI-GPU demand.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires showed to the door: Meta Platforms\n\nThe second surprising Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires were casting aside during the quarter ended in March is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms. Nine successful billionaires -- or 10, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Meta stock, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,259,650 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,313,528 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,164,151 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (779,637 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (735,911 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (727,500 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (175,614 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (29,157 shares)\n\nThe top reason behind this selling was very likely profit-taking. Since hitting its bear market low in 2022, shares of Meta had gained close to 500%.\n\nBillionaires may also have been leery about Meta's somewhat unpredictable capital expenditure forecasts. Shares came under pressure in 2022 because of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's desire to spend on the metaverse and augmented/virtual reality innovations. They began rallying in a big way last year when spending forecasts were reined in a bit. But based on Meta's 2024 guidance, it appears as if Zuckerberg and his team are willing to aggressively spend, once again, on AI and other innovations that may not have a sizable payoff for years to come.\n\nThe third possibility for this selling activity might be concern about the health of the U.S. economy. Meta generates nearly 98% of its sales from advertising, and ad spending is highly cyclical. The stock market is incredibly pricey at the moment, and a historic decline in M2 money supply -- the first since the Great Depression -- suggests a recession might occur in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBut unlike Nvidia, I believe billionaires will regret paring down their stakes in Meta. It owns the top social media assets worldwide (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger), and has been able to sustain strong ad pricing power in most economic climates. Meta remains one of the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, based on forward-year cash flow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire investors can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nWhile trading activity in the Magnificent Seven leaned decisively to the sell side with Nvidia and Meta, and was mixed with other constituents, the one member that billionaires absolutely couldn't stop buying is e-commerce leader Amazon. Nine billionaire investors were willing buyers of Amazon stock during the first quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAlthough Amazon is best-known for its world-leading online marketplace, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income and cash flow from a couple of its faster-growing ancillary segments. It's these ancillary operations that likely attracted billionaires to buy shares of Amazon hand over fist during the March-ended quarter.\n\nArguably no operating segment is more important than cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, and is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. Best of all, cloud-service margins are significantly higher than online retail margins, which means AWS typically accounts for a majority of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAdvertising services and subscription services are holding their own, as well, with sustained double-digit sales growth. Amazon draws more than 2 billion people to its site each month, which affords it exceptional ad-pricing power. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscriptions in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe final selling point for billionaires might be Amazon's valuation. Since Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business, cash flow is a far better valuation metric than the traditional price-to-earnings ratio. After spending the entirety of the 2010s at a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow, Amazon can be purchased right now for just 12.4 times consensus cash flow for 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "TMUS, T, AMZN: Which “Strong Buy” Communications Play Is Best?",
        "content": "The communications scene is home to some intriguing companies, many of which boast fairly reasonable valuations at this point in the bull market. Undoubtedly, the communications scene entails a high degree of spending. In a falling-rate environment, such heavy spenders may catch more of a break. In any case, the following firms — TMUS, T, and AMZN (even though AMZN may not seem like a communications play at first) — seem worth checking out while the analyst community views them as Strong Buys.\n\nTherefore, let’s check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to get a better gauge of which stock may be the best bet for the long haul.\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)\n\nMany legacy telecom firms fumbled the ball in a big way many years ago, allowing T-Mobile to not only grab the ball but sprint at explosive speed toward the endzone. Today, TMUS stock is pretty much the go-to telecom stock to own if you seek steady gains. Over the past 10 and five years, shares have soared over 380% and 112%, respectively.\n\nThough the momentum has slowed in recent years, with a bit more volatility (shares lost almost 33% from peak to trough of their value in the back half of 2021), I still view T-Mobile as a winner with the means to keep on taking share and powering growth. As such, I’m staying bullish, even if the pace of gains has slowed a bit.\n\nIt’s not just heavy investment in an enviable 5G wireless infrastructure that’s given T-Mobile the edge over rivals, but the firm has also not been afraid to undercut rivals. Whether it’s through aggressive promotions or new plan “types,” T-Mobile certainly stands out as an aggressor in a market of firms that seemingly only know how to play defense.\n\nRecently, T-Mobile unveiled its “Flex” plans, which include a “free” phone for subscribers, among other perks. The plans are also pretty affordable, starting at $50 per month for unlimited 5G data, talk, text, a robocall-blocking service (goodbye annoying spam calls), and a very generous 100GB in cloud storage space courtesy of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google One.\n\nIf that sounds like a deal too good to pass up, that’s because it is, especially in an uncertain economic landscape with many consumers still “hungover” from inflation. At this pace, it seems like TMUS stock is bound to pick up momentum as the company gains more market share while holding onto the share it already has.\n\nIts first-quarter results saw T-Mobile add 532,000 postpaid customers, topping rivals but coming in line with the additions enjoyed in the same quarter a year prior. With the new Flex plan, count me as unsurprised if additions get a big jolt.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of TMUS Stock?\n\nTMUS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 15 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average TMUS stock price target of $188.15 implies 13.7% upside potential.\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T)\n\nAT&T is one of the laggards in the telecom scene, as it’s struggling to catch up to the top dog, T-Mobile. Despite the multi-year slump, the main draw to AT&T stock is the nice dividend (6.33% yield) and the potentially “deep” value to be had in shares. At 7.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), T stock goes for far less than T-Mobile, which boasts an 18.3 times forward P/E at writing. And though T-Mobile recently announced a dividend (current yield of 1.6%), it represents just a fraction of AT&T’s dividend yield.\n\nPersonally, I’d much rather be in the market leader that’s taking share than a firm that’s undergoing a massive transformation where success is no guarantee. As such, I’m neutral on the stock, though I am enticed by its recent deal with satellite network firm AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS), which could put the legacy telecom firm on the cutting edge of tech again with “space-based direct-to-mobile technology.”\n\nCould satellite connectivity be the next frontier for the telecoms? It could be. And it could represent an opportunity for AT&T to hit back at T-Mobile. By investing wisely, AT&T could attract and retain remote consumers who rely on satellite for a decent internet connection.\n\nIn any case, it’s too hard to tell when AT&T’s AST SpaceMobile deal will pay off. It could be many years if not more than a decade. Though less material over the medium term, I view it as an encouraging sign of where AT&T could be looking for next-generation growth.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of T Stock?\n\nT stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with nine Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average T stock price target of $21.25 implies 21.4% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon is an e-commerce and cloud-computing firm that has a hand in many pies, from groceries (think Whole Foods) to video streaming (Prime Video) and even gamer-focused social media (Twitch). The communications scene is just another market that Amazon could look to make a lateral move into as it expands its many service segments.\n\nCall Amazon a digital retailer or cloud service provider, if you will. However, it can pay dividends (not literally) to view the firm as more of a market disruptor that’s not satisfied unless it’s disrupting new markets to fuel its growth profile. Given its ability to sustain growth by targeting new markets, I have to stay bullish even with new all-time highs in sight.\n\nOn the surface, Amazon doesn’t seem to have all that much exposure to communications, at least compared to other media and telecom pure-plays. Digging deeper, though, it becomes more apparent that Amazon is an influential force in the communications scene. In fact, I’d argue that the communications landscape is ripe for disruption and could become a serious growth market for Amazon in the distant future.\n\nLive-streaming platform Twitch and audiobook platform Audible are just two “media” businesses that the firm can build off of in a big way. Such businesses represent a sliver of the overall Amazon pie today, but perhaps they could be part of a budding communications segment at some point down the road, especially as AI is thrown into the mix.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon’s more experimental projects may just put the telecom scene on notice a decade or more from now. Specifically, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, which is shooting to construct a broadband internet network of 3,236 satellites, could be a development to watch closely as Elon Musk’s satellite internet firm Starlink shows signs of early success. For Amazon, Project Kuiper represents a potential threat to traditional telecoms in the future.\n\nWith AMZN stock going for just north of 40 times forward P/E, I not only think such a project is not being baked in to the valuation, but the full potential of its AI-enabled cloud business may not be as well.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?\n\nAMZN stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 42 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average AMZN stock price target of $220.60 implies 20.5% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nAnalysts hold communications stocks in high regard these days. The competitive landscape may be fierce, but with next-generation innovation (think 6G, satellite connectivity, and beyond) and potentially lower rates thrown in, I view the communications market as intriguing. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside in T stock for the year ahead.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) Can Still Rise Despite Sitting at the Top",
        "content": "Numero Uno stock Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a $3 trillion market cap, has delivered a return of around 1,154% over the last decade. Sitting at the top of the global stock markets, will it continue to give similar returns in the next decade? I believe the answer is yes. Microsoft’s consistently strong performance, cloud & AI-driven tailwinds, and robust margins despite substantial AI investments make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll take advantage of any market weakness in the coming months to purchase MSFT.\n\nMicrosoft’s Recent Results Were Strong Yet Again\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft reported impressive Fiscal Q3 results for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all business segments. Q3 adjusted earnings of $2.94 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $2.82 per share. Also, earnings jumped 20% year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.45 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, revenues soared 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion. The Intelligent Cloud business segment, encompassing Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and Windows, among others, grew 23% year-over-year to $26.7 billion, beating expectations yet again. The much-watched segment now comprises 35% of total revenues, with AI playing a significant role as a catalyst driving growth.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of AI by businesses, there is a substantial demand for Microsoft’s Azure and related cloud services. Not surprisingly, Azure and other cloud services witnessed solid revenue growth of 31% (28% in constant currency), significantly surpassing Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nDespite the strong Q3 performance, Microsoft provided a conservative outlook, slightly below expectations. Fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to be $64 billion compared to consensus expectations of $64.5 billion, with Azure revenues expected to grow between 30% and 31%.\n\nOn a positive note, Microsoft offered its FY2025 outlook, anticipating double-digit growth in both revenues and operating income. This forecast reassures investors of the company’s sustained growth trajectory.\n\nAI Will Continue to Act as a Long-Term Catalyst for MSFT\n\nAI has propelled Microsoft to become the largest stock in the world, and it will continue to be the driving force behind its growth story in the coming decade. Microsoft’s early investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT has positioned it ahead of other tech giants.\n\nThe demand for AI remains insatiable, with Microsoft management stating that it exceeds available capacity. This high demand drives continuous heavy investment in AI by Microsoft and other tech titans.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s AI investment plans align with those of its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the space. For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported CAPEX (capital expenditures) of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) spent $6.72 billion. Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Microsoft reported a 22% sequential jump in CAPEX (including finance leases) to $14 billion versus $11.5 billion in the prior quarter. The majority of that amount is assigned to scaling its AI infrastructure and securing processors from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for running large AI models.\n\nIncreasing CAPEX may impact margins. However, Microsoft’s management is taking the initiative to keep costs low and protect margins. For instance, newer and more efficient AI products like GPT-4o and Mai-1 are expected to increase scale and keep costs under control. Furthermore, Mai-1 will compete with major rivals, namely Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nAzure AI Services, which includes AI training and other AI-related services, is experiencing remarkable growth. Azure competes directly with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Google’s cloud business and is closely watched by investors. Notably, Azure AI Services is now estimated to be an over $4 billion run rate business. For comparison (although not a direct comparison), Amazon’s AWS has reached a $100 billion annual run rate. This underscores the substantial opportunity for Azure powered by AI in the coming years.\n\nDuring the earnings call, management confirmed that Azure continues to gain market share, with 65% of Fortune 500 companies using Azure Open AI. There’s a clear acceleration in Azure’s growth, marked by the signing of large deals across several diverse industries, with names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) being added to its clientele. Azure will likely continue to see the growth momentum with increased market share gains in the coming months.\n\nFurther, Microsoft 365 Copilot (AI-backed online assistant) is showing steady adoption. Management stated that 60% of Fortune 500 companies now use the Copilot AI program. The company remains optimistic about its growing contribution to revenues in the coming years.\n\nIt’s not just Azure and Copilot. Microsoft’s AI investments and capabilities are expected to boost revenues and profitability across other product portfolios, such as GitHub, Fabric, and Security.\n\nOn a separate note, MSFT’s acquisition of gaming software rival Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will continue to add to MSFT’s diversified revenue stream. Microsoft recently announced the unveiling of its own mobile store game, equivalent to Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Google’s Play Store.\n\nMicrosoft’s Valuation Isn’t Cheap but Isn’t Expensive Either\n\nDespite being the most valuable stock in the world, Microsoft’s valuation isn’t as expensive as one would think. At first glance, It may look expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37x currently. Nonetheless, I believe the premium is justified, given its favorable industry-leading market position, robust margins, diversified revenue stream, and huge exposure to high-growth AI and cloud businesses.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, online retail and cloud computing giant Amazon is trading at a P/E of 51x, while social networking company Meta Platforms is trading at a 27x P/E.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Microsoft stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the earnings report. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past month. Microsoft stock’s average price target of $491.56 implies 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying MSFT for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm, and Microsoft continues to lead the charge. Microsoft’s early investments in AI have positioned it as a frontrunner in the industry, yielding significant rewards. I believe that Microsoft’s GenAI innovations will continue to drive revenues, profits, and cash flows in the coming years.\n\nWith a long runway for growth and profitability ahead, Microsoft remains a compelling investment. I plan to keep adding MSFT to my portfolio, taking advantage of any market weaknesses in the coming months.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) on Friday closed above the 40,000 threshold for the first time ever, driven by the latest leg up in the stock market rally after softening inflation data rekindled investor optimism about rate cuts.\n\nAlthough the benchmark index has been trading below that historic level in the past few days, analysts at Yardeni Research maintain an optimistic stance about Dow’s long-term prospects, reiterating their target of 60,000 by 2030.\n\n“Along the way, there could be corrections and even another bear market. But we expect that earnings growth, supported by productivity gains, will drive the stock market higher over the rest of the decade,” analysts wrote.\n\n“Just for fun, we drew some trend lines on a chart of the DJIA and stumbled on a channel starting around 2010 that can be extrapolated to a range of 45,800 to 76,700 by the end of the decade. The mid-point is 61,250. Mark your calendars!” they added.\n\nYardeni notes that, according to Dow Theory, the recent rise of the DJIA to a new high may not be sustainable unless it is confirmed by the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA), which remains below its record high.\n\nThey believe that leaner business inventories will soon boost demand for transporting goods, and relatively stable fuel prices will benefit transport companies and their stocks.\n\nThe analysts also point out that the DJTA's weakness may be partly structural, signaling that services are becoming more important to the economy than goods. Thus, it is possible that the DJIA could diverge from the DJTA sustainably.\n\nMoreover, the market research firm highlighted an intriguing divergence between the forward earnings of the S&P 500, which are at a record high, and those of the S&P 500 Air Freight&Logistics industry, which are well below their peak.\n\n“The former is getting a boost from the strength of the US economy, while the latter might be weighed down by weakness in the global economy and competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),” Yardeni analysts noted.\n\nFinally, analysts also reflected on the ongoing rollercoaster ride in the Bull/Bear Ratios (BBR). During the week of May 21, the Investors Intelligence BBR rose to 3.45, pointing to a significant shift back into the bullish camp, with 59.4% bulls and only 17.2% bears.\n\n“There may be too many bulls again for the DJIA to decisively break out above 40,000 for now,” Yardeni’s team added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDow Jones at 60,000 by 2030?

        "title": "'Demand is just so strong': Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells Yahoo Finance supply can't keep up",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn't lack demand. What he lacks is supply.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's first quarter earnings report Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\n\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\n\nNvidia is transitioning from its current Hopper AI platform to its more advanced Blackwell system. Ahead of the company's results on Wednesday, some analysts on Wall Street had raised questions about whether some customers would be more cautious with Hopper orders ahead of the more Blackwell units later this year.\n\n\"Hopper demand grew throughout this quarter — after we announced Blackwell — and so that kind of tells you how much demand there is out there,\" Huang said.\n\nHuang added that demand for both platforms will outstrip supply well into next year, with the complexity of these chips also challenging the company's efforts to keep pace.\n\n\"Every component, every part of our data center, is the most complex computer the world's ever made,\" Huang said. \"And so it's sensible that almost everything is constrained.\"\n\nFor the first quarter, Nvidia reported results that topped Wall Street forecasts, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a 461% and 262% jump from the prior year, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income tallied $18.1 billion in the first quarter. Nvidia's quarterly results topped expectations again on Wednesday. (Source: Company Filings)\n\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue to reach $28 billion plus or minus 2%. That’s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected.\n\nThe company also announced a 10-to-1 stock split — in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own — that will go into effect June 10 for shareholders as of June 7.\n\nNvidia also joined its Big Tech peers in boosting its quarterly dividend, with shareholders now set to receive a dividend of $0.10 per share, up from $0.04.\n\nNvidia stock rose as much as 6% in extended trading on Wednesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangs speaks at the company's office in Santa Clara, Calif., April 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nHuang also discussed how Nvidia will navigate the transition from AI training, in which companies train AI models, to AI inferencing, where those same companies deploy models for customers to use.\n\nQuestions have swirled about whether large-scale cloud providers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) would drop Nvidia's chips for inferencing in favor of their own offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Huang sees Nvidia's offerings being just as powerful for inference as they are for training.\n\n\"We have a great position in inference, because inference is just a really complicated problem,\" he said.\n\n\"The software stack is complicated. The type of models that people use is complicated. The vast majority of inferencing today is done on Nvidia. And so, we expect that to continue.\"\n\nThe CEO also touched on the growth the company is seeing in sales to customers beyond major cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, saying that companies ranging from Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) to pharmaceutical firms are increasingly buying up Nvidia chips. In fact, the biggest industry using Nvidia's data-center chip, excluding the cloud companies. is automotive.\n\n\"Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,\" Huang said. \"But every single car, someday we will have to have autonomous capability.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon, AI startup Hugging Face pair to use Amazon chips",
        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com's cloud unit on Wednesday said it has partnered with artificial intelligence startup Hugging Face to make it easier to run thousands of AI models on Amazon's custom computing chips.\n\nValued at $4.5 billion, Hugging Face has become a central hub for AI researchers and developers to share chatbots and other AI software and is backed by Amazon, Alphabet's Google and Nvidia, among others. It is the main place that developers go to obtain and tinker with open-source AI models such as Meta Platforms' Llama 3.\n\nBut once developers have tweaked an open-source AI model they typically want to use the model to power a piece of software. On Wednesday, Amazon and Hugging Face said they had paired up to make it possible to do so on a custom Amazon Web Services (AWS) chip called Inferentia2.\n\n\"One thing that's very important to us is efficiency - making sure that as many people as possible can run models and that they can run them in the most cost effective way,\" said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face.\n\nFor its part, AWS is hoping to lure more AI developers to use its cloud services for delivering AI. While Nvidia dominates the market for training models, AWS argues it chips can then operate those trained models - a process called inference - at lower cost over time.\n\n\"You train these models maybe once a month. But you may be running inference against them tens of thousands of times an hour. That's where Inferentia2 really shines,\" said Matt Wood, who oversees artificial intelligence products at AWS.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Michael Perry)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The cloud computing boom may have lost a bit of its luster as an investing theme since the glorious rise of generative artificial intelligence (gen AI). Undoubtedly, we’ve all gotten used to all the benefits of connecting to the cloud (or a remote data center). Many of us have taken the cloud for granted, as many application developers have already made the transition.\n\nIn these early innings of AI’s rise, many powerful large language models (LLMs) will need to run on remote data centers. As the number of parameters swells in size, it’s clear that the most powerful LLMs will find their home in the cloud. In the coming quarters, we’ll start seeing smaller, perhaps shrunk-down LLMs finding their home in our own local hardware. There are benefits to running AI both in the cloud and on the edge (our devices).\n\nIn this piece, we’ll focus on three undervalued cloud computing stocks that are innovating on gen AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud pioneer hard at work on next-generation AI products that can add value in the enterprise. As a top cloud and AI company still led by one of its founders, Marc Benioff, I’d not overlook the name as it looks to keep breaking boundaries with innovation. At this pace, I view Salesforce as an underrated technology darling that should get as much love as the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to AI in the cloud, it’s all about getting the most power and smarts out of a model. Salesforce’s Einstein Copilot isn’t just another AI assistant that can do a wide range of fun things; it’s a cloud AI that could help bring clients even closer to their customers. Indeed, adding AI across the suite could help its clients gain an even larger edge over their rivals.\n\nWhether that’s in the form of more sales, better time management, or cost savings, Salesforce is one of the cloud AI firms that could see considerable gains as their gen AI investments begin to pay off over the next four years. Benioff and company are playing the long-term game, making CRM stock a great buy-and-hold type of name.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is another firm that’s benefited greatly from its prior transition into the cloud. Nowadays, it’s looking to embed gen AI across its many tools. While AI has also paved the way for new rivals, I believe Adobe is innovating on AI at such a pace that it will retain its lead in the creative software scene.\n\nRecently, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been rolling out gen AI across various applications within its Windows OS. Even Microsoft Paint has been given an AI jolt with some impressive new features, including image generation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs intriguing as the Paint upgrades are, the application is still not at the same level as some of Adobe’s offerings, like Photoshop and Illustrator. If anything, I expect continued AI upgrades across Adobe’s suite could help it pull further ahead of other players in the creative software market.\n\nWhether we’re talking about the new Adobe Firefly model or AI additions across the slate, ADBE stock is an underrated and overlooked AI stock while it’s down 30% from its peak. It’s about time investors had given CEO Shantanu Narayen the benefit of the doubt when it comes to his firm’s new AI trajectory.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have public cloud service firm Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is in great shape to capitalize on the cloud AI boom. Undoubtedly, enterprises are going to want access to the most powerful AI models. This entails cloud-based AI rather than edge AI, the latter of which is better suited for consumers who value privacy over AI smarts.\n\nWith Amazon’s custom chips and the newest Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPUs coming to Amazon data centers, it’s clear has enough medium-term catalysts to justify hanging onto the stock as it looks to break out past $185 per share.\n\nThough Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Adam Selipsky stepped down more than a week ago, I wouldn’t make too much of the matter. Amazon is primed (forgive the pun) to seize the AI cloud opportunity at hand. And at 51.3 times trailing price-to-earnings, I still view the tech juggernaut as pretty cheap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) reported first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday that topped expectations while also announcing a 10-for-1 stock split and an increased dividend, following some of its Big Tech peers in doling out heftier quarterly payments to shareholders.\n\nThe company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a jump of 461% and 262%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nAnalysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg.

But Kress pointed out that revenue out of China was down significantly in the quarter, since the company was forced to halt shipments of its most powerful chips to the country.

        "title": "3 Inexpensive Stocks That Could Deliver Jaw-Dropping Returns",
        "content": "Everything looks expensive right now.\n\nFrom groceries to travel and fuel, we’ve seen massive price hikes across all industries. And unless inflation cools, we must deal with it. However, investors can make the most of the impact of inflation on the stocks. Several stocks have seen a drop in value despite reporting impressive quarterly results.\n\nSo, could this be your chance to pounce? A few inexpensive high-potential stocks can deliver jaw-dropping returns, and they have already reported strong fundamentals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach stock trades below $200 and present as a long-term buy and hold. As some of the best companies in their respective industries, these stocks have the strength to survive the market turmoil and rise higher. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeaten-down Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock is trading at $143 today and has lost 8% value in the past month. The company has been under pressure after the first-quarter results since investors weren’t happy with the guidance.\n\nAirbnb had the best Q1 ever with 133 million nights and experiences booked. It reported an 18% year-over-year (YOY) jump in revenue to hit $2.1 billion. The net income came in at $264 million, which is also its most profitable first quarter.\n\nHowever, the market only paid attention to the guideline for the second quarter which shadowed the impressive numbers. The management is aiming for a 9% revenue growth in Q2 to hit $2.7 billion, lower than the growth achieved in the first quarter and below estimates. Since Airbnb operates an asset-light model, it has the potential to gain financial strength with each profitable quarter.\n\nI believe Airbnb is a solid long-term play and am impressed at the company’s bounce-back post pandemic. The summer travel could lead to better-than-expected results for the company.\n\nABNB gives strong competition to hotels and is using technology to enhance user experience. I think the market reaction is overdone, and the recent dip in the stock is a chance to accumulate.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a poor start to 2024, and its price has only started to recover slowly. The company reported a drop in iPhone sales due to the economic downturn and also announced a massive buyback. Investors aren’t very convinced about the future of Apple. But I believe this is one company that can bounce back at any time.\n\nStory continues\n\nUp 3% year-to-date (YTD), AAPL exchanges hands for $192 and is moving closer to the 52-week high of $199. If you can keep the drop in iPhone sales aside, Apple looks like a highly lucrative business with a powerful brand name. Its service segment is thriving and has outperformed other segments. In the recent quarter, it reported a 14% YOY revenue jump.\n\nMoreover, Apple enjoys high brand loyalty and this has helped it expand across the world. Someone using an Apple product today might not easily switch to another brand. Yes, one cannot ignore the China problem, but I think Apple has the potential to handle this situation well.\n\nAlso, it has enough resources to keep innovating and offering the most technologically advanced products to consumers. Apple has announced the largest share repurchase in history and this move has worked in its favor. Additionally, it declared a 25-cent dividend for shareholders. Looking at the company’s growth story, the stock looks inexpensive at the current level and is a buy-and-hold.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is exchanging hands for $183 today and is up 23% YTD. The stock has seen a steady rise over the past 12 months, and it is not long before it hits $200.\n\nThe company reported a blowout quarter driven by the cloud segment and advertising revenue. With two of its fastest-growing segments, Amazon has become so much more than an e-commerce company.\n\nIt saw a 13% jump in sales to $143.3 billion. The cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) showed a 17% YOY revenue growth while the advertising segment was up 24% YOY. Notably, the net income reached $10.4 billion as compared to the net income of $3.2 billion in the same period the prior year.\n\nFurther, Amazon has a highly diversified business with multiple revenue sources which will continue driving growth. It started investing in artificial intelligence (AI) well in time to gain a higher market share with AWS. Thus, its investments have started to pay off. Finally, it also has enough cash flow to keep investing in the business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Fox Squirrel Solar in Madison County, Ohio. (Photo by Matt Reese)\n\nMADISON COUNTY, Ohio, May 22, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EDF Renewables North America and Enbridge Inc, a leading North American energy infrastructure company (TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB), celebrated today with more than 100 guests, the completion and start of commercial operation of the 150 MWac Fox Squirrel Solar Phase 1. When all three phases are completed at the end of 2024, the 577 MWac project will be one of the largest utility-scale solar developments east of the Mississippi River.\n\n\"The development and operation of Phase 1 marks a significant milestone in our journey to drive Ohio’s renewable energy future,\" said Kate O’Hair, Senior Vice President for Onshore Development with EDF Renewables North America. \"With Fox Squirrel Solar Phase 1 now supplying renewable power to the PJM grid, this project not only represents a substantial financial commitment but also highlights the remarkable collaboration between our team, the county, and the local community. We take great pride in this collective effort.\"\n\nDeveloped by EDF Renewables and owned in partnership with Enbridge, Fox Squirrel Solar will help meet central Ohio’s increasing demand for power, which is expected to double in the decade leading up to 2028.\n\nDuring the event, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced it has entered into power purchase agreements for the full generation capacity, which will help contribute to Amazon’s commitment to match all of the electricity used by its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030. The company is currently on a path to meet its goal by 2025. As renewable energy commitments are increasingly embraced by corporations, solar projects like Fox Squirrel will help Ohio realize its goal of continuing to attract business and increasing economic growth in the state.\n\n\"Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy. As part of that journey, we’re proud to enable new solar and wind projects in Ohio that will not only help power our operations, but also provide carbon-free energy to the local communities where our customers, vendors, and employees live and work,\" said Kevin Miller, Vice President of Global Data Centers at AWS. \"Projects like Fox Squirrel Solar are also helping create jobs, support local businesses, and boost the local tax base, which are all part of Amazon’s commitment to become a more sustainable company.\"\n\n\"Fox Squirrel Solar is a key part of Enbridge’s commitment to the energy transition, and we are proud to celebrate the grand opening of the project, which expands our longstanding partnership with EDF Renewables in Canada and Europe,\" said Tom Carbone, Vice President, Power Business Development, Enbridge. \"For more than 70 years, Enbridge has been operating in Ohio and we’re excited about the additional construction, long-term operations and maintenance jobs this project will provide, along with additional local economic benefits. We are also particularly pleased the power generated at Fox Squirrel Solar will support Amazon’s efforts to reach its net-zero targets.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Fox Squirrel Solar is a prime example of how we can support Ohio's business energy demands and stabilize our electric energy infrastructure,\" said Ohio Chamber President & CEO Steve Stivers. \"We are now expecting one of our major utilities to double their need for energy in the next five years, and the only way to keep up with this growth is to actively develop and bring energy projects to market. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce supports an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach to energy development, and we appreciate projects like Fox Squirrel Solar that help to balance our ever-increasing energy demands.\"\n\nNearly 400 men and women in the skilled trades are currently working on the project. During peak construction of Phase 1 that number soared to 650 workers. Blattner is the project’s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor.\n\n\"At Blattner, we’re excited about this project and our ongoing partnership with EDF Renewables,\" said Chris Hodrick, Senior Vice President, General Manager – Solar and Storage, Blattner. \"Working together with EDF Renewables, local policymakers and construction partners, we’ve made a difference for communities in Madison County, an important part of our work to lead America to a clean energy future.\"\n\nPat Hook, Business Manager, IBEW Local 683, said, \"IBEW Local 683 has the skilled men and women to build best-in-class solar facilities. We are the trusted workforce of the electrical industry including gas and electric utilities, maintaining power lines, and lighting our homes and businesses. We have worked in coal, natural gas, and nuclear. And now we are electrifying America through solar. Ohio is at the forefront of an energy revolution and Fox Squirrel Solar is a shining example of where we are going.\"\n\n\"The Ohio Laborers’ District Council is thrilled about our partnership with EDF Renewables and the opportunity to build a solar facility to help power Ohio’s growing energy demands,\" commented Ralph Cole, Business Manager/Secretary Treasurer of the Ohio Laborers’ District Council. \"Laborers in Ohio are building the infrastructure that sustains our way of life, provides good wages and benefits, and contributes to our community’s bottom line. Fox Squirrel Solar is going to create hundreds of jobs, and power the grid with homegrown energy for years to come.\"\n\nScott Stevenson, IUOE Local 18, added, \"Ohio Operating Engineers Local 18 is proud to be supporting the skilled labor of the Fox Squirrel Solar Project. The project will provide much needed clean energy and support our energy infrastructure as we rebuild our electric generation fleet in Ohio. Local 18 is a trusted partner with EDF Renewables and we appreciate the opportunity to work on this important project that will benefit our schools, community, and workforce.\"\n\nComprised of 1.4 million panels and 159 inverters in total, Fox Squirrel Solar represents the largest onshore renewable energy project developed by EDF Renewables North America.\n\nEDF Renewables, with its extensive experience and track record of success, is dedicated to providing solutions that help customers achieve their carbon-reduction goals.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Should Be the Backbone of Your Retirement Portfolio",
        "content": "Perhaps the first word you’re looking for when investing in the best retirement stocks to buy is ‘resiliency’. Hence, you’re looking to load up on stocks that have weathered the storms of time, delivering sturdy returns. These companies typically offer indispensable products and services bolstered by strong brand equity and solid financial health.\n\nAdditionally, in hunting for retirement stocks, we’re also looking at companies characterized by their ability to consistently generate bottom-line growth, regardless of the economic situation. Moreover, another area you’re looking at is its track record of incrementally increasing dividend payments. With that said, here are three ideal stocks for a retirement portfolio built to last.\n\nRetirement Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech stock like none other. Its journey from a small software vendor to a global tech juggernaut is truly astounding. What sets it apart is its consistent evolution and involvement in dynamic, transformative tech trends over time. Few would’ve guessed its impressive trajectory from being a PC operating systems provider to becoming a needle-mover in cloud computing, AI, robotics, and more. Most recently, its partnership with OpenAI has positioned it as the key orchestrator of the generative AI revolution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, its financials are a peach, with revenue growth and net income margin averaging 14% and 34.4%, respectively, over the past five years. Consequently, it amassed a formidable cash war chest, with a levered free-cash-flow margin averaging 24% over the same period. Lately, we’ve seen its cloud computing arm in Azure outperforming other segments with a boost from AI infusion.\n\nIn terms of returns, MSFT has been a tremendous wealth compounder, with a 5-year total return of 228%, way ahead of the S&P 500’s 102% gain. These returns also factor in its quietly growing dividend, which may seem modest but has consistently grown for nearly two decades.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another growth story that never ceases to amaze. The company has evolved from a bookstore to a tech titan through its insatiable appetite for innovation. It has effectively rewritten the rules of online retail and cloud computing, dominating the two realms.\n\nNaturally, it’s been an incredibly rewarding investment over the years, returning more than 1,141% to its investors in the past decade. In other words, had you invested $10,000 in AMZN stock in 2004, you would’ve compounded that investment to $124,100.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough it’s the most prolific name in e-commerce, Amazon is now equally renowned, if not more, for its cloud computing service. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth engine for the company, with multiple analysts suggesting it could be a trillion-dollar entity. Moreover, with AI tailwinds propelling AWS, we expect this service to leave its competition in the digital dust.\n\nHence, AMZN is the most future-proof stock, with multiple catalysts motion. It continues to grow its top-and-bottom lines by double-digit margins.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) A Caterpillar backhoe at the top of a hill\n\nSource: aapsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe construction industry is one of an economy’s core pillars and relies heavily on Caterpillar’s (NYSE:CAT) robust equipment and services. With nearly 100 years in the game, Caterpillar’s iconic yellow machinery has led to the development of countless projects globally. Moreover, it’s been one of the most resilient businesses over the years, surviving multiple crises while consistently delivering shareholder value. This enduring success underscores its powerful role in driving construction and economic growth.\n\nBacked by stellar top-and-bottom-line growth, CAT stock has been a spectacular wealth compounder in recent years. In the past five years, the stock has delivered a handsome 226% total return for its investors, more than double the S&P 500’s return. Moreover, it boasts a superb dividend profile, with roughly 30 years of payout growth, while yielding 1.46%.  Also, in just the first-quarter (Q1), the firm allocated a whopping $5.1 billion toward share buybacks and dividend distributions.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Nvidia stock retreats from record high ahead of crucial first quarter earnings report",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock retreated from a record high on Wednesday ahead of its first quarter earnings report set for release after the bell. The report is expected to be one of the most consequential for investors this year, as Nvidia has been at the center of the AI boom driving markets over the last 18 months.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to report revenue and profits that rose more than 200% and 400%, respectively, from the prior-year period as the company experiences a surge in demand for its chips amid the AI boom.\n\nAnalysts expect adjusted earnings per share to total $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nNvidia stock has been on a tear over the last year, rising over 200% and closing at a record high on Tuesday. The stock has risen nearly 700% since the stock market lows in October 2022. Shares were off around 0.4% in early trade on Tuesday.\n\nThe vast majority of Nvidia's revenue will come from its Data Center business, which is set to pull in $21 billion, up from $4.28 billion in Q1 last year.\n\nThe company’s Gaming division, formerly its largest segment, is expected to see revenue of $3.5 billion, up from $2.24 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nAhead of Nvidia’s earnings announcement, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on the company’s share price to $1,085 from $910, saying that he anticipates Nvidia will once again beat expectations on the top and bottom lines and raise its guidance for the next quarter.\n\nDemand for its chips from hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and others has boosted the company's results, making Wednesday's report a key check on the industry's appetite for further AI investment.\n\nAnd as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, the AI trade has moved beyond the borders of tech, with investors looking to energy and power companies as derivative plays on the AI boom.\n\nBut Roy, like analysts at BofA Global Research and Loop Capital, says there remain near-term concerns about how much the transition from Nvidia’s current Hopper line of AI chips to its Blackwell line will impact overall sales.\n\nThe fear is that customers will put some of their orders for Hopper chips on hold while they wait for Nvidia to roll out its more powerful Blackwell products. On Tuesday, Amazon said it had transitioned an upcoming supercomputer project to Blackwell chips after a report from The Financial Times suggested the retail giant had paused some chip orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nLoop Capital’s Ananda Baruah argued it's possible Nvidia won't let companies put their Hopper orders on hold without losing their place in line to purchase Blackwell chips. If enough customers put their orders on hold in favor of Blackwell chips, Nvidia could see a temporary dip in quarter-over-quarter sales. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang displays products onstage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia is also contending with the threat of its customers building their own in-house AI chips.\n\nSo far Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are using — or are working toward — their own AI chips that provide better power efficiency than Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nThat doesn’t mean those companies will completely abandon Nvidia’s chips, though the push to their own products could cut into the chip giant’s market share. AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are gaining steam when it comes to their own AI chips.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft announced during its Build conference that it would begin offering AMD’s MI300X chips for developers looking to train and deploy AI models. The Windows maker also made sure, however, to point out that it is using Nvidia’s chips as well. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about the importance of The Dow Jones Industrial Average touching the 40,000 mark for the first time ever. Cramer said that the Dow hitting its new highs was a \"team effort\" with stocks from many different sectors adding to the index's gains, instead of just the gains from major tech stocks with size and growth similar to the likes of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nCramer said that many of the Dow stocks should have been \"hurt\" by the consistent rate hikes by the Fed.\n\n\"They should have been crushed by the inflationary spiral. They should have been annihilated by supply chain problems during COVID. None of that happened.\"\n\nCramer Doesn't See \"Anything\" Like 2008 Crisis Happening\n\nCramer said that it's been almost 20 years since the 2008 financial crisis. Cramer said when he \"surveys\" today's market \"landscape\" he sees the situation totally different from what it was back then.\n\n\"I just don’t see anything like that happening.\"\n\nCramer said that many people would argue that no one saw the 2008 financial crisis coming, but in fact there were many who were warning about the impending collapse, including him.\n\nJim Cramer said that back in 2007 he was \"screaming\" about the \"danger.\"\n\nCramer Laments Over Negativity in the Market\n\nCramer lamented that younger investors from millennials and Generation Z have grown to be pessimists when it comes to the stock market. He wondered whether its his \"job\" to celebrate the Dow hitting 40,000 to infuse some positivity in the market. Cramer said his generation (the Baby Boomers) believed that they were better off when compared to their previous generation financially and had a positive attitude in the stock market.\n\nJim Cramer wondered what's wrong with celebrating when stocks go high.\n\n\"We have so much negativity that surrounds us. We are drowning in it. All of a sudden something positive falls into our lap, a major milestone… does it make sense to scoff at it?\" Cramer said.\n\n\"I'm Not Asking for Champagnes or Trophies\"\n\nThe CNBC host said he's not asking for \"champagnes\" or \"trophies\" to celebrate the Dow's new milestone. What Cramer wants is the rejection of \"nihilism\" and skepticism that's prevailing in the market. Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks\n\nJim Cramer recommended several stocks in his latest programs aired on CNBC. We watched these programs and picked 5 stocks for this article that he either recommended investors to buy or hold.

Cramer said he usually doesn’t \"like to say that but I believe in the theory\" that copper could be a short squeeze.

        "content": "United Natural Foods, Inc. UNFI exemplified its focus on growth with its latest move. The company unveiled that it has extended its wholesale grocery distribution partnership with Whole Foods Market by inking an eight-year extension deal.\r\n\r\nThis new agreement, which makes United Natural Whole Foods Market's (an affiliate of Amazon.com) primary distributor, extends the partnership until May 2032, replacing the previous deal terms.\r\n\r\nUNFI remains enthusiastic about its long-standing partnership with Whole Foods Market, through which it can offer high-quality foods and other valuable items to consumers nationwide. The company remains dedicated to supporting Whole Foods Market and working together to cater to customers’ evolving demands.  Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market remains committed to enhancing its ties with United Natural, which plays a vital role in its supply chain.\n\nUnited Natural Treads Growth Path\n\nUnited Natural is on track with its comprehensive transformation journey that involves several strategic elements. As part of this process, the company is rapidly implementing near-term value-creation initiatives that are expected to contribute significantly to its operating efficiencies. In this regard, the company has actioned $150 million in run-rate savings.\r\n\r\nThese initiatives are not just about immediate gains but serve as a foundation for the company's long-term transformation goals, providing a robust platform for future growth and efficiency. A key aspect of the company’s transformation strategy is the focus on maintaining operational and transformation momentum. This is crucial for sustaining long-term value creation for stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and shareholders.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoving on, UNFI expects to incur nearly $400 million in capital and cloud implementation, which includes investments in transformation plans, with significant spending on network optimization and automation. The upgrade in the technology infrastructure is likely to drive higher efficiency. The company is progressing well with its key transformation investments that are likely to increase efficiency and service levels.\r\n\r\nUnited Natural is on track to improve its supply chain processes and management disciplines to fuel growth. In this regard, the company is achieving a major reduction in shrink, which is positively impacting its financial performance and operational efficiency. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, net shrink as a percentage of sales declined year over year as well as sequentially. Apart from this, the company is improving its commercial go-to-market programs to enhance supplier connections.\n\nStory continues\n\nWrapping Up\n\nUnited Natural’s strategic endeavors, such as the latest extension of the agreement with Whole Foods Market, keep the company well-placed amid a challenging backdrop. Incidentally, consumers are buying less to manage their budgets and shifting away from traditional grocery stores, possibly seeking more affordable options like discount stores, bulk buys or online shopping. On its last earnings call, management highlighted that it anticipates a more prolonged recovery for volume.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have tumbled 27% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 7.2%.\n\n3 Appetizing Bets\n\nVital Farms Inc.

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks That Could Be Millionaire-Makers: May Edition",
        "content": "There are some key robotics stocks for investors to buy in May, amid the broader indices like the Nasdaq surging upwards. Some analysts expect the rally for tech stocks in general will continue.\n\nThe robotics stocks to buy mentioned in this article are powerful names, and I believe they will continue to deliver strong gains to investors. Those who get in early will reap the rewards. Investing a substantial amount in these companies could lead to seven-figure returns later on, as the growth potential of these companies is enormous.\n\nRobotics continues to be an interesting field for investors with bountiful opportunities, which could lead them to minting new millionaires later on. A sizable investment into these firms is required to get such impressive gains, but I feel the prospect of rewards far outweighs the risks involved.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, here are three robotics stocks to buy for May that could have millionaire-maker potential.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize warehouse operations for major companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT). The company is also exploring opportunities to bring its warehouse automation solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses, potentially unlocking a new and lucrative market segment.\r\n\r\nThe company also employs advanced robotics and AI to manage and optimize high-density storage and goods movement for major retail, wholesale and food & beverage companies.\r\n\r\nIn the first fiscal quarter of 2024, Symbotic reported a revenue of $369 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $14 million. That marks a significant improvement from the same period last year, which saw a revenue of $206 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $16 million.\n\nThe company’s cash and marketable securities also grew to $677 million. Looking ahead, Symbotic anticipates revenues between $400 and $420 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with adjusted EBITDA expected to be between $12 and $15 million​.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is known for its popular Roomba vacuum cleaners. Despite recent challenges, including a failed merger with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), iRobot has strong intellectual property and continues to innovate in the robotic home appliance market.\n\niRobot reported a significant year-over-year revenue decrease in its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, earning $150 million compared to $160.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, the company is focusing on operational restructuring to stabilize its financial situation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has reaffirmed its financial expectations for 2024, predicting a revenue range between $825 and $865 million, with anticipated GAAP net losses per share ranging from $3.13 to $2.70. The outlook remains cautious due to ongoing economic uncertainties and the impact of recent corporate changes.\n\nStill, I feel IRBT could be one of those penny stocks that could potentially mint new millionaires. The company’s IP is rock-solid, and it’s one of the earliest pioneers in the robotics market. I think we’ve yet to see management tap into its full potential.\n\nSeiko Epson (SEKEY) A photo of a printer made by Seiko Epson.\n\nSource: Cineberg / Shutterstock.com\n\nSeiko Epson (OTCMKTS:SEKEY) is a top manufacturer of SCARA robots, commonly used for high-speed, high-accuracy pick-and-place or assembly operations in industrial settings.\r\n\r\nThe company reported its financial results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, revealing a solid performance with annual revenues amounting to $8.68 billion. It achieved a net income of $347.68 million over the last year, with earnings per share standing at $0.56. For the most recent quarter, Seiko Epson reported earnings of $0.10 per share, meeting the earnings expectations and indicating a stable financial position.\n\nSEKEY is planning to construct its first biomass power plant in Iida City, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, aiming for operation by the fiscal year ending March 2027. Additionally, Seiko Epson has developed a new technology in their crystal devices segment called wide amplitude low-voltage differential signaling (WA-LVDS).\n\nSEKEY could then be one of those robotics stocks that could mint new millionaires.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMatthew started writing coverage of the financial markets during the crypto boom of 2017 and was also a team member of several fintech startups.

        "title": "Target earnings miss the mark as inflation-battered shoppers avoid buying things they don't really need",
        "content": "Target (TGT) missed the earnings mark in the first quarter.\n\nBlame inflation-battered US households, says its execs.\n\nThe \"biggest challenges\" Target is hearing about from its shoppers are \"inflation in food and household essentials,\" chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with reporters detailing first quarter results.\n\nCornell added that inflation is putting a \"strain on the consumer wallet.\"\n\nHe went on to say sales trends are \"normalizing\" in categories where inflation has eased.\n\nThe strain weighed most heavily on Target's bread and butter — physical stores — where traffic and the number of transactions fell in the quarter.\n\nThe expansive supercenters continued to see sales weakness in discretionary departments such as home goods.\n\nAs a result of the store sales slump, Target CFO Michael Fiddelke says the company is planning the business \"conservatively\" for the balance of the year.\n\nTo right the ship and close the gap with better-performing rival Walmart (WMT), Target unveiled a plan on Monday to slash prices on 5,000 items like milk, meat, and bread.\n\nThe company has already lowered prices on about 1,500 items, and this will continue into the summer.\n\nThe earnings rundown\n\nNet sales: -3.1% year over year to $24.5 billion, vs. estimates for $24.13 billion Gross profit margin: 27.7% vs. 26.3% a year ago, vs. estimates for 27.4% Diluted EPS: -1% year over year to $2.03, vs. estimates for $2.05 (guidance: $1.70 to $2.10) Comparable sales: -3.7% year over year (last year it rose 0.7%; Walmart reported a 3.8% gain in the first quarter of 2024) vs -3.68% estimate\n\nDigital comparable sales: 1.4% Store comparable sales: -4.8%\n\nWhat else caught our attention\n\nInventory fell 7% from the prior year. The company once again didn't repurchase any of its stock in the quarter, despite having $9.7 billion left on a prior buyback authorization. Both the number of transactions and average check size declined 1.9% in the quarter. Target ended the quarter with almost $3.6 billion in cash. Second quarter earnings per share are projected to be $1.95 to $2.35, vs. estimates for $2.19.\n\nComparable sales for the quarter are seen unchanged to up 2%. Full-year earnings per share are projected to be $8.60 to $9.60 (reiteration of prior guidance), vs. estimates for $9.43.\n\nOne weapon Target doesn't have in its arsenal is a cloud services business that could fund retail investments, like rival Amazon (AMZN). Amazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky joined for a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast to share what AWS is up to next.

        "title": "Here Are All 44 Stocks Warren Buffett Holds for Berkshire Hathaway's $378 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "In case you missed it, what's arguably the most important data release of the second quarter occurred last week -- and I'm not talking about the monthly inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nMay 15 marked the deadline for institutional money managers and wealthy investors with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F provides a portfolio snapshot that allows professional and everyday investors an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's most-admired investors have been buying, selling, and holding.\n\nTo be fair, 13Fs aren't perfect. These snapshots can be up to 45 days old when filed with the SEC. Nevertheless, 13Fs can alert investors to the stocks, industries, and trends that are piquing the interest of successful/billionaire money managers. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThere's not a 13F on Wall Street that's more anticipated each quarter than that of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). CEO Warren Buffett has delivered a greater than 5,000,000% aggregate return to his Class A shareholders (BRK.A) since taking the reins in the mid-1960s, and has practically doubled-up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over six decades.\n\nBased on Berkshire's 13F for the quarter ended in March, Warren Buffett and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are overseeing 44 stocks across the company's roughly $378 billion portfolio. Note, I've excluded the two index funds Berkshire Hathaway holds small stakes in -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- because index funds represent baskets of securities and aren't themselves stocks. I've also removed Paramount Global, which Buffett admitted to selling in its entirety during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting.\n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive breakdown of the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's core investments\n\nDespite putting $378 billion to work in 44 stocks, Warren Buffett and his team run a highly concentrated portfolio. This is to say that Buffett invests more of his company's capital in his top ideas. As of the closing bell on May 17, eight of Berkshire's holdings had a market value in excess of $10 billion, with these eight core holdings accounting for 82% of the company's $377.6 billion portfolio.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL): $149,766,876,019 in market value Bank of America(NYSE: BAC): $40,529,112,715 American Express(NYSE: AXP): $36,794,400,783 Coca-Cola: $25,244,000,000 Chevron(NYSE: CVX): $19,983,053,835 Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY): $15,687,146,596 Kraft Heinz: $11,719,597,100 Moody's: $10,138,291,967\n\nStory continues\n\nEven after selling more than 116 million shares of Apple during the first quarter, this tech giant still accounts for nearly 40% of Berkshire's invested assets.\n\nWhile Buffett has never been a tech-savvy investor, he understands consumer buying habits very well. Apple has a loyal customer base and has historically leaned on its physical product and subscription service innovation to drive its growth. It also doesn't hurt that Apple has repurchased a jaw-dropping $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began. Buybacks of this magnitude have helped increase Berkshire's ownership stake in Apple, as well as provided a boost to the company's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nYou'll note two other trends among the Oracle of Omaha's core investments: a heavy dose of financials and energy stocks.\n\nWith regard to the former, Buffett appreciates cyclical businesses that grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy. Bank of America, which is the most interest rate-sensitive large bank in the U.S., is able to expand its loan portfolio during long-winded periods of economic growth. Meanwhile, American Express benefits from playing both sides of the transaction aisle. It generates fees by processing transactions for merchants, and also acts as a lender, generating possible annual fees and interest income from its cardholders.\n\nAlthough energy stocks haven't historically comprised a sizable percentage of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, Buffett and his crew have absolutely piled into Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. These are integrated energy companies that generate their juiciest margins from their upstream drilling segments. If the spot price of crude oil remains elevated due to constrained global supply, Chevron and Occidental should bring in plenty of operating cash flow. Just keep in mind that while Chevron has one of the most flexible balance sheets among energy majors, Occidental Petroleum is still digging itself out of a sizable debt-driven hole. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe other billion-dollar wagers at Berkshire Hathaway\n\nEven with a jaw-dropping percentage of Berkshire's portfolio put to work in the eight core companies listed above, there are still 20 additional stocks Buffett and his team are invested in that have a market value ranging between $1 billion and $8 billion.\n\nMitsubishi: $7,766,903,245 Chubb: $7,126,722,854 Mitsui: $6,400,541,253 Itochu: $5,515,170,124 DaVita: $5,043,273,040 Citigroup: $3,553,897,791 Marubeni: $2,710,573,632 Kroger: $2,703,500,000 Sumitomo: $2,672,029,041 BYD: $2,514,497,175 Visa(NYSE: V): $2,325,861,013 VeriSign: $2,184,421,236 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): $1,848,100,000 Mastercard(NYSE: MA): $1,834,575,677 Capital One Financial: $1,766,147,269 Liberty SiriusXM Series C: $1,713,670,919 Nu Holdings: $1,247,933,834 Aon: $1,194,945,000 Ally Financial: $1,247,933,834 Charter Communications: $1,049,933,912\n\nThese \"other\" billion-dollar bets are comprised of a heavy-dose of financial stocks (Warren Buffett's favorite sector), some of the Oracle of Omaha's \"indefinite\" holdings, and a sprinkling of ideas from Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.\n\nThe Oracle's love of financials is on full display with market share-leading payment processors Visa and Mastercard accounting for more than $4.1 billion of invested assets. In 2022, Visa and Mastercard combined for approximately 69% of credit card network purchase volume in the United States. Both companies have exceptionally long runways with which to organically or acquisitively expand their payment infrastructure into chronically underbanked emerging markets.\n\nThis billion-dollar bet section also contains Berkshire's notable investments in Japan's five largest trading houses (Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo). These are highly diverse companies that have their hands in multiple sectors and industries within Japan's economy. In Buffett's latest annual letter to shareholders, he described these trading houses as \"indefinite\" holdings for his company.\n\nLastly, this is the section where we begin to really see the influence of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler take shape. For example, e-commerce company Amazon isn't a stock that Warren Buffett purchased. Though the Oracle of Omaha appreciates Amazon and, in hindsight, regrets not buying it sooner, the company's primary cash flow drivers, such as cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), are beyond his typical scope of research and/or interest. AWS is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate revenue.\n\nWarren Buffett's smaller holdings\n\nThe final section of Berkshire's approximately $378 billion portfolio is comprised of 16 smaller holdings that range in value from a low of $8.7 million to about $995 million.\n\nSnowflake: $994,883,570 Liberty SiriusXM Series A: $861,964,366 T-Mobile: $859,111,380 Louisiana-Pacific: $589,460,585 Floor & Décor: $567,290,400 Liberty Formula One Series C: $555,939,247 Liberty Live Series C: $442,297,801 Liberty Live Series A: $193,488,459 Sirius XM Holdings: $111,146,193 NVR(NYSE: NVR): $85,437,168 Diageo: $32,456,653 Lennar Class B(NYSE: LEN.B): $23,375,556 Liberty Latin America Series A: $22,993,122 Jefferies Financial Group: $20,377,226 Liberty Latin America Series C: $11,235,175 Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C: $8,733,337\n\nThese smaller holdings are traditionally where we see Combs and Weschler exercise their influence. As you can see from these 16 companies listed above, there's a focus on finding value in a generally pricey stock market.\n\nFor instance, Berkshire Hathaway's brightest minds began making investments in homebuilders during the second quarter of 2023. Although the largest position, which was a stake in D.R. Horton, has been sold, Combs and Weschler are still overseeing close to $109 million in invested assets between NVR and Lennar.\n\nShares of industry-leading homebuilder Lennar can be had for about 10 times forward-year earnings at a time when the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings ratio is historically high. Meanwhile, NVR (the parent of Ryan Homes) has a higher price-to-earnings ratio than its peers, but also operates a land-light model that relies on lot purchase agreements (LPAs). Instead of buying and developing land like its peers, its puts down a small, nonrefundable deposit via LPAs that doesn't tie up much of its capital. This has allowed NVR to grow at a considerably faster pace than its peers.\n\nWhile it's always possible for one of these smaller holdings to eventually become a core holding at Berkshire Hathaway, these sub-$1-billion-dollar stakes are better viewed as shorter-term investments (one-to-five years).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Tesla Stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) Tread Water Until the Robotaxi Unveiling?",
        "content": "I’m bearish on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and I can’t help but think that Elon Musk’s announcement regarding the unveiling of a Robotaxi on August 8 is something of a distraction. So, why would Musk be distracting us? Well, vehicle sales are slowing, margins are falling, and Tesla’s dominance in the electric vehicle (EV) segment is over. Plus, the stock’s valuation is high. This is why I’m bearish on TSLA stock, but I don’t expect it to move much until we know what Musk has in store for us on August 8.\n\nTesla’s Performance Is Underwhelming\n\nIn Q1, Tesla reported a 9% decline in quarterly revenue — the steepest year-over-year decline since 2012 — and a 48% decrease in adjusted profit. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at 45 cents versus the expected 49 cents. Also, revenue for the quarter fell to $21.3 billion — less than the $22.2 billion the market had anticipated.\n\nRevenue fell both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. Meanwhile, net income dropped 55% to $1.13 billion from $2.51 billion a year ago. On a non-adjusted basis, net income per share fell from 73 cents a year ago to 34 cents in Q1 2024. Moreover, in an increasingly competitive market, Tesla’s price cuts negatively impacted margins with no obvious end in sight.\n\nHowever, Musk also pointed to unforeseen challenges as a reason for the company’s underperformance. “We navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont. As we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure, and a lot of other order manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead. We believe this is not the right strategy, and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market,” Musk said in the Q1 earnings call.\n\nAm I Underestimating Tesla’s AI Potential?\n\nIn Q1, Tesla’s free cash flow turned negative. The Austin-based company reported a deficit of $2.53 billion, representing a significant change from a year ago when Tesla had a free cash flow of $441 million. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported free cash flow of $2.06 billion. Tesla explained that the negative cash flow was due to a $2.7 billion increase in inventory and $1 billion in capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\n\nAI is certainly the buzzword of investing at this moment in time, and I don’t believe that it’s overused. However, some analysts are arguing that investors shouldn’t be valuing Tesla as a car company but as a tech company at the forefront of AI.\n\nI’m a little skeptical about this, even though I appreciate that Tesla has AI capabilities in areas like manufacturing, the Tesla Bot, and energy trading. So far, though, I’m yet to be convinced that these are parts of the business with revenue-generating capacity that is remotely comparable with car production.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the AI-enabled Robotaxi could change my opinion. The question is whether Tesla has really managed to achieve a quantum leap in autonomous technology. This would truly put Tesla in the driving seat and establish its dominance in the autonomous segment.\n\nThe growth of the Robotaxi segment would also open up another revenue-generating segment, which does look highly attractive. Autonomous cars require lots of computational power, but that power would only be used when the vehicle is active. This means these impressive computers will only be used a fraction of the time.\n\nSimilar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Tesla could sell this spare capacity and create a new and potentially sizeable revenue stream. “It seems like kind of a no-brainer to say, OK, if we’ve got millions and then tens of millions of vehicles out there where the computers are idle most of the time that we might well have them do something useful,” Musk said in the Q1 results call, adding that Tesla could have 100 gigawatts of “useful compute.”\n\nTesla’s Valuation and Musk’s Promises\n\nMusk has a habit of overpromising and underdelivering. So, this is why I remain bearish on Tesla. I’ve yet to see evidence that Tesla is about to drop a fully autonomous vehicle, which happens to have spare computational capacity that can be used and sold as part of some Tesla cloud.\n\nThis wouldn’t be a problem if Tesla’s valuation was in line with its peers. However, Tesla is currently trading around 70x forward earnings. What’s more, analysts clearly aren’t convinced that growth will pick up in the medium term, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of 5.75x.\n\nFor now, the promise of an autonomous vehicle appears to be keeping the share price elevated despite the lack of concrete information. All eyes, therefore, are on August 8. I believe the stock could tread water until then.\n\nIs Tesla Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, Tesla comes in as a Hold based on nine Buys, 15 Holds, and nine Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Tesla stock price target is $174.60, implying 6.4% downside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Tesla Stock\n\nPersonally, I’m skeptical as to whether Tesla has really made a breakthrough in autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, I accept that Robotaxi and fully autonomous vehicles, in general, have huge potential. This potential isn’t limited to the road but also, as Musk discussed, the ability to sell unused computing power to the rest of the market. However, at 70x forward earnings, I simply can’t put my money behind Tesla.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amid rampant market hype, many high-profile companies with solid growth rates are seeing strong uptake from investors. But that’s not to say all growth stocks are seeing the same sort of enthusiasm from investors. There are plenty of overlooked growth stocks with robust fundamentals that go unnoticed, presenting lucrative investment prospects across various sectors.\n\nWith a strong bull market appearing to be underway, many investors are looking for the best opportunities to buy into this upside. The thing is, finding companies with the right mix of long-term growth potential and undervaluation (or a relative lack of coverage from Wall Street) is hard to do. The following three companies are ones I’d put in this bucket.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into three growth stocks I think are overlooked and should be considered as long-term buys for investors oriented toward growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom Video (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the pandemic’s ultimate star in the video conferencing space, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) has certainly become a hot name in the sector. The company’s Q4 2023 results highlighted excellent growth despite post-pandemic headwinds, with the company seeing significant profitability growth that’s attracting growth and value investors alike. Now trading at 29-times earnings, ZM stock is widely viewed as a value play. The shift towards enterprise revenue hints at potential accelerated growth.\n\nIndeed, I’m of the view that profitability growth is going to matter more than revenue growth during the next phase of this bull market cycle. Investors want to see real returns on their investment. In this regard, Zoom provides plenty to be excited about.\n\nWe’ll find out more about how Zoom’s top and bottom line growth is proceeding when it reports its Q1 2025 earnings on May 20. The market is expecting to see a $1.125 billion revenue, and earnings per share to come in within the range of $1.18 to $2. Q1 will most likely see some sustained demand for Zoom’s products such as Webinars, Rooms, and Phones. Introducing Compliance Manager and Swoogo’s hybrid events offering will further expand the company’s solutions and attract enterprise customers.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) An image of the Matterport, Inc. (MTTR) logo\n\nSource: Matterport\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is an intriguing potential growth stock for investors to consider. The company recently launched a platform aimed at enterprise clients looking to make their emissions reporting more robust. This platform measures emissions saved through its digital twin platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloped with carbon accounting experts, these reports help clients grasp emissions reduced by remote collaboration instead of onsite inspections. As corporations prioritize climate responsibility, they commit to UN Sustainable Development Goals and set science-based targets for emission reduction.\n\nMatterport’s 3D digital twins streamline tasks like tours and inspections, cutting Scope 3 emissions. They reduce costs and boost productivity for businesses with large property portfolios, offering virtual collaboration.\n\nMoreover, its new reporting quantifies the sustainability impact of digital twins, aiding enterprises in making eco-conscious property decisions. A Fortune 100 client praised the concise avoided emissions report for showcasing sustainability benefits. I think as this market grows, Matterport’s market capitalization should as well over time.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) stands out in the software industry with its essential database software and swiftly expanding cloud computing divisions. Embracing artificial intelligence trends, Oracle has experienced rapid growth. In mid-2024, demand for its Gen2 AI infrastructure surpassed supply despite extensive data center expansions. Its leading position in database software and booming AI-driven cloud services attract significant investor attention.\n\nAccording to reports from The Information, Elon Musk’s AI venture, xAI, is engaging in talks with Oracle about a $10 billion cloud contract. Unsurprisingly, Oracle shares surged on the news. Sources revealed that if finalized, xAI could emerge as one of Oracle’s major clients. Established a year ago, xAI aspires to rival OpenAI in extensive language model development for generative AI applications. Oracle’s stock soared over 3% to $119.89, hitting $122 post-news before a minor pullback.\n\nThe deal signals Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s triumph over rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), seen as a boost for Oracle amid rising demand for generative AI. Despite a sales slowdown last year, Oracle’s stock rebounded after a robust February quarter report, with a 49% surge in cloud infrastructure revenue to $1.9 billion. This isn’t the first collaboration between Musk’s startup and Oracle. The companies previously worked together to supply high-powered computing chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to support xAI. Do yourself a favor and grab this and the rest of these overlooked growth stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Sell in May and Run Away: 3 Retail Stocks on the Brink of Collapse",
        "content": "The big story in the retail sector is the new look for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that resulted in better earnings. The result was a soaring share price for the world’s largest retailer.  There are many reasons for success like this for Walmart; and it is shown by many measures.\n\nOne of the most important indicators for a retailer is the cash conversion cycle. That reveals how quickly goods are sold, how fast merchandise becomes money. For Walmart it is super low at less than four days. The average cash conversion cycle for a department store is around 30 days. Walmart knows its customers!  Also low for Walmart is the short float under 1%, which shows that few are betting that the share price will fall. Anything above 10% is considered high. Those wagering that Walmart stock will rise have been rewarded as it is up more than 20% for 2024!\n\nBut there are many tales of woe for others among retail stocks to sell. Walmart and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have crushed much of the competition. Others are struggling from crime and the aftermath of the pandemic. More are working from home, depriving retailers of foot traffic from those at nearby offices. For many, the Peter Lynch approach of visiting and seeing who is busy can be utilized to make an investing decision.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters (AEO) A photo of an American Eagle Outfitters Inc (AEO) sign hanging above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere will certainly be far fewer American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) stores to visit as up to 500 could be closed in the next two years. Earlier this month, it was announced that the store in downtown San Francisco will close on Jun. 12. Merchandise is not moving. The cash conversion cycle is nearly two months when the industry average is 30 days.\n\nWhen goods are not selling it shows up everywhere on the balance sheet and the income statement of retail stocks to sell. American Eagle is certainly no different. Mass closings of stores will save money but it hardly inspires confidence among investors for the long term as it means that merchandise is not selling enough to keep those locations open.\n\nThe numbers certainly tell that story. For the first quarter of 2024, the average profit margin for the S&P 500 was 11.7%. For American Eagle Outfitters, it is 3.23%. Returns on assets and income are in single digits, too. The short float is in double digits, meaning many are betting the share price will fall. Shutting down hundreds of stores will not change that bearish outlook to bullish. Moreover, earnings are down by double digits over the last five years. Like the short float, debt is very high, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the stock has had a good run, it was down for the last week of market action. Selling into strength and running away with a profit is never a bad idea. The crushing debt, the unhealthy cash conversion cycle, anemic margins, the big short and the closing of 5oo stores highlight the weaknesses of American Eagle Outfitters.\n\nBig Lots (BIG) Photo of a Big Lots (BIG) store shot from the parking lot with a shopping cart in the foreground and clear blue sky in the background. BIG stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) is a discount retailer headquartered in Columbus, Ohio that expanded to well over 1000 stores across the United States. This expansion was costly and did not go well due to competition and the pandemic. As a result, the short ratio and debt ratio are staggeringly high. The share price has fallen so much it is a classic value trap as the price to sales, price to book, and price to cash ratios are alluring to the unsuspecting in retail stocks to sell as each is in low single digits.\n\nBut the share price has fallen more than 50% this year for lots of reasons. Its cash conversion cycle is 82 days, almost three months. American Eagle Outfitters is looking to shut down 500 stores with a cash conversion ratio of less than two months as a comparison.\n\nChanneling my inner Peter Lynch, there was a Big Lots store near a place I used to own in New Hampshire. The store and parking lot never seemed to have any customers. Nearby there was a Walmart that was always bustling. Moreover, the retail king had many vehicles with license plates from Canada, Maine and Vermont. That was never the case with the Big Lots’ store…go figure!\n\nFoot Locker (FL) Foot Locker (FL) storefront sign in a city\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/philip openshaw\n\nLook at it this way: When Nike (NYSE:NKE) sneezes, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) catches the flu as about 55% of the sales of the retailer carry The Swoosh!\n\nNike is hobbled with sales flat and earnings down on a quarterly basis, so Foot Locker is limping. Foot Locker is moving away from its dependency on Nike, which was around 70% earlier in the decade. But Foot Locker is having to rebuild as a result. And that means shutting down stores, planning to close 400 by 2026.\n\nNike goes after a younger demographic with the “typical customer” being a GenX male.  The average age in America is close to 40, in 1960 it was under 30. The country is getting older! It is never a good idea for a retailer to be on the wrong side of societal trends as “demographics are destiny.” Foot Locker stock is down nearly 50% over the last year. Sales and earnings are off, and, unsurprisingly, it is losing money. The stores of Foot Locker may not be attracting customers but the stock sure has shorts circling with a high percentage betting the share price will fall.\n\nDisclosure:On the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Many tech firms report high revenue growth. But some of them are unprofitable and need several years before they report a quarter with positive GAAP net income.\n\nThese hot tech stocks still have growth numbers that can charm investors, yet they’re also profitable. Also, the three stocks to buy have strengthened their net profit margins.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

A single cyber hack can cost a small business millions of dollars. Cyber attacks could drain large corporations even more as hackers can temporarily shut down their operations. There’s also the reputation damage associated with a hack and the winding road of regaining the trust of their customers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) helps keep hackers away from your data and sensitive files. The company’s Falcon Platform can detect threats before they become serious. And, it offers the necessary tools and resources to fortify your digital defenses.\n\nThe company has a valuable place in the cybersecurity industry. Many businesses use it to keep themselves protected. But what about investors? It turns out that Crowdstrike has delivered solid long-term returns for its investors. The stock is up by 40% year-to-date (YTD) and has rallied by 439% over the past five years.\n\nThe firm generated $53.7 million in GAAP income compared to a net loss last year. Impressively, Q4 of 2024 revenue grew by 33% year-over-year (YOY) and the company’s annual recurring revenue came to $3.44 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is winning over more investors as it cuts down on costs while delivering good revenue growth. The tech conglomerate reported 15% YOY revenue growth in Q1 of 2024 along with 57% YOY net income growth. Alphabet stock is up by 27% YTD and has more than tripled over the past five years. Currently, it trades at a 28 P/E ratio.\n\nAdvertising is the company’s main revenue growth engine. But the corporation is also making steady gains in cloud computing. Google Cloud revenue jumped from $7.45 billion to $9.57 billion YOY. Cloud computing now represents more than 105 of the company’s total revenue. Also, operating income is soaring for this segment, rising from $191 million to $900 million in a single year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company’s ability to cut costs and grow its financials prompted a dividend. Alphabet’s quarterly dividend starts at $0.20 per share, but investors should expect a double-digit compounded annual growth rate for several years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn addition, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been performing well. The stock is up by 23% YTD and has more than doubled over the past five years. The corporate giant has been cutting costs and delivering high-growth opportunities in numerous industries.\n\nMost of Amazon’s revenue comes from its online marketplace. Millions of consumers buy products on Amazon. Reasons for this include its wide selection, fast shipping and the convenience of buying products without leaving your home.\n\nThe recent Q1 of 2024 earnings results demonstrate the business model is still working well. Net sales increased by 13% YOY with double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets. Amazon Web Services (AWS) accelerated in the quarter with 17% YOY revenue growth. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help cloud sales accelerate for several quarters. And, net income came to $10.4 billion in the quarter compared to $3.2 billion in the same period last year.\n\nAmazon has exposure to advertising, groceries, streaming and other high-potential business models that should continue to grow for several years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG and AMZN.

        "content": "U.S. equities appear to be back on the rise in May. After suffering significant losses in the month of April, both the S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have more than recovered. In fact, the Nasdaq has risen 11.24% as of the end of Friday’s trading session. Leading the rise of U.S.-listed stocks has largely been technology companies. Everything from the rise of cloud computing to advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have boosted share prices.\n\nTech giants, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google have become trillion-dollar companies in terms of their stock market capitalization. Over the next decade, several mega-cap tech stocks are well on their way to reaching $1 trillion. Below are three of them.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which boasts an $84 billion market cap, has become a dominant force within the cloud-based cybersecurity space. Embedding artificial intelligence technology into its vulnerability management (VM) tools has only increased the value of its products. CrowdStrike’s Falcon end-point security platform had its debut way back in 2013 and always employed machine learning techniques to identify threats across an enterprise’s technology apparatus. The release of advanced AI models has allowed the platform to be a one-stop solution for end-point security.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCloud-based cybersecurity has increased in demand over the past decade. The rise of cloud computing technology placed tons of enterprise data and applications on cloud servers. In a multitude of manners, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated demand for cloud products, as many businesses went remote and adopted online tools powered by cloud technology. With companies storing much of their data in distant servers versus on their own premises, cybersecurity has become increasingly important.\n\nNot to mention, the cybersecurity space is succumbing to increased consolidation. A lot of these smaller cybersecurity players have lost out to other larger players, including CrowdStrike. For evidence, one just needs to observe the robust double-digit growth rates of CrowdStrike’s sales figures versus the plummeting rates of similar VM platforms like Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), or Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS).\n\nCrowdStrike shares have risen 35.5% on a year-to-date-basis and could very well continue their rise as the platform dominates its respective space.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a key semiconductor computer processor giant. Consumer technology enthusiasts know AMD for their competitively priced and quality central porcessing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The chipmaker was able knock Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) off its feet due to adopting a fabless model of producing silicon chips. That is, rather than being bogged down on the manufacturing side of chipmaking like Intel, AMD outsourced that to the very capable Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). It effectively allows it to focus on chip design and efficiency.\n\nAMD next momentous rise will be in the space of AI chips. The semiconductor firm announced an array of new GPUs that would empower the creation of large language models (LLMs) in June 2023 and followed that up with subsequent releases in December. Of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI chip space currently but as AMD enters the market and acquires market share, not only will AMD increase sales and net income growth, but its market capitalization could skyrocket.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing makes the final entry on this list. This Taiwan-based contract chip manufacturer has a market capitalization of $672 billion and is poised to rise even further. The chip manufacturer dominates in terms of manufacturing capabilities and capacity. To make silicon chips more efficient from generation to generation, it’s always been about fitting more transistors on a smaller node size. TSM has been able to successfully manufacture chips at a 3-nanometer node size. It is the most advanced in the industry at this point.\n\nBecause of TSM’s prowess, companies like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD have leveraged its capabilities to construct their advanced chips. What will make TSM a $1 trillion company is the demand for AI chips. In their first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, TSM handily beat both revenue and earnings estimates. The reason was the sizable demand for advanced AI chips that has been all the craze over the past 12 months.\n\nRiding off of this demand and its successful manufacturing competencies, TSM is probably the most likely on this list to become the next Apple, Amazon or Google in terms of market cap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings, revenue expected to surge first quarter as AI trade faces latest test",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is set report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday in what will be one of the most consequential reports for investors this year.\n\nWall Street is expecting Nvidia to report revenue and profits that rose more than 200% and 400%, respectively, from the prior year period as the company experiences a surge in demand for its chips amid the AI boom.\n\nAnalysts expect adjusted earnings per share to total $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nNvidia stock has been on a tear over the last year, rising over 200%. The stock has risen nearly 700% since the stock market lows in October 2022.\n\nThe vast majority of Nvidia's revenue will come from its Data Center business, which is set to pull in $21 billion, up from $4.28 billion in Q1 last year.\n\nThe company’s Gaming division, formerly its largest segment, is expected to see revenue of $3.5 billion, up from $2.24 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nAhead of Nvidia’s earnings announcement, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on the company’s share price to $1,085 from $910, saying that he anticipates Nvidia will once again beat expectations on the top and bottom line and raise its guidance for the next quarter.\n\nDemand for its chips from hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and others has boosted the company's results, making Wednesday's report a key check on the industry's appetite for further AI investment.\n\nAnd as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, the AI trade has moved beyond the borders of tech, with investors looking to energy and power companies as derivative plays on the AI boom.\n\nBut Roy, like analysts at BofA Global Research and Loop Capital, says there remain near-term concerns about how much the transition from Nvidia’s current Hopper line of AI chips to its Blackwell line will impact overall sales.\n\nThe fear is that customers will put some of their orders for Hopper chips on hold while they wait for Nvidia to roll out its more powerful Blackwell products. The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Amazon had paused some orders from Nvidia as it waits for more advanced Blackwell chips to be made available.\n\nLoop Capital’s Ananda Baruah argued it's possible Nvidia won't let companies put their Hopper orders on hold without losing their place in line to purchase Blackwell chips. If enough customers put their orders on hold in favor of Blackwell chips, Nvidia could see a temporary dip in quarter-over-quarter sales.\n\nStory continues NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang displays products on-stage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, California, on March 18, 2024. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia is also contending with the threat of its customers building their own in-house AI chips.\n\nSo far Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are using — or are working toward — their own AI chips that provide better power efficiency than Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nThat doesn’t mean those companies will completely abandon Nvidia’s chips, though the push to their own products could cut into the chip giant’s market share. AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are gaining steam when it comes to their own AI chips.\n\nOn Tuesday, for instance, Microsoft announced it will begin offering AMD’s MI300X chips for developers looking to train and deploy AI models during its Build conference. The Windows maker also made sure, however, to point out that it is using Nvidia’s chips as well. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "The AI revolution is here.\n\nIt’s being implemented in business, everyday life and machines/electronics of all shapes and sizes. The companies that produce this AI and the technology that supports it are winning big, and you don’t want to miss out.\n\nThese three AI stocks are the top picks for investors looking to rake in some serious profits amidst this current boom in May. While these stocks are showing excellent performance right now, they may promise spectacular long term growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe’ll detail these companies’ software and services that use AI, their promising investments in the field and what their recent earnings mean for their futures.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) uses its massive income to seize the opportunity to grasp as much market share in AI as possible. One of Amazon’s primary AI applications it features in its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company continuously seeks to provide users with the ultimate platform for building AI through AWS. With top-of-the-line chips from Nvidia and a full selection of language models, Amazon ensures it’s available through AWS.\n\nAmazon’s efforts have not been fruitless. Income from the AWS segment was up by $4.3 billion. Also, sales were up 17% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1. It’s no secret that Amazon has ample cash flow to continue supporting these ventures. And, its extensive cloud platform brought in just shy of $100 billion in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months.\n\nAMZN uses AI to optimize its e-commerce platform and has seen great success in implementations that cut costs and improve user experiences. While it has a comparatively high valuation, there is little to no doubt that it will continue to grow.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world, and the Windows developer is leading the AI revolution. After investing in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, last year, Microsoft declared its position in the AI race. So, it has displayed its intention to stay at the head of the pack.\n\nFurthermore, ChatGPT is one of the most significant language models available, capable of producing images, text and code. Microsoft has eagerly begun implementing Chat GPT’s various capabilities into its platforms. Those include cloud, Microsoft Office and workflow applications.\n\nLooking at Microsoft’s most recent earnings report, we can see the diversity of the company’s success. Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure brought in $35.1 billion. Moreover, business productivity platforms, such as Microsoft Office, brought in a sizable $19.6 billion. Personal computing and entertainment also saw commendable success at $15.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, with Microsoft’s massive cash pile, it is not wasting any time putting it in smart places. Microsoft is looking to make its own name in the AI field and has crafted its answer to ChatGPT and other generative AI with Microsoft Copilot. The company has slowly but surely begun to integrate the chatbot into each platform to increase user capabilities exponentially.\n\nCopilot already boasts thousands of users as it continues to grow. Therefore, Microsoft is a stock you can buy and hold for life while the company continues expanding to new heights.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is not as prominent within the cloud and AI industry as Microsoft and Amazon. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic buy. Valued much cheaper than the previous two, Oracle is a leader in database software. It is slowly ramping up its AI cloud infrastructure to be shoulder-to-shoulder with top competitors.\n\nThe company’s most recent earnings show a 49% increase in revenue from continued investments in the cloud. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Safra Catz notes the demand for the company’s Gen 2 AI cloud infrastructure far exceeds the supply. And this is despite the company’s extremely rapid development of cloud data centers.\n\nWith the reported over $80 billion in remaining performance obligations, it is hard to see how Oracle won’t continue its rapid growth for some time. What makes this promise even sweeter is the relatively low valuation at which Oracle still sits.\n\nAt a forward P/E ratio of 32.79, the stock will rise exponentially in price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "What Nvidia says about AI chip demand could matter for more than just the tech trade",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence enthusiasm has been spreading across the stock market.\n\nWednesday night's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings call will mark a year since the chipmaker first shocked Wall Street with its demand for AI chips. Since then, mentions of AI have skyrocketed on earnings calls, growing 186% since the first quarter of 2023, per Bank of America Research.\n\nThis comes as the conversation around AI has quickly moved from AI chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) to AI power users like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). More recently, strategists have highlighted a broadening out to other sectors that could benefit from the increased power usage, like Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), and Commodities.\n\n\"It's not just about NVDA anymore,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nThis shift has already been underway in the market. Several precious metals, including copper (HG=F), which strategists have said will benefit from AI spend, have hit recent highs. The Utilities and Energy sectors are two of the top-performing sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this year, up about 15% and 13%, respectively.\n\nThis has trickled down to individual names that are now rivaling the meteoric stock rise of Nvidia since the start of 2024. Texas-based Vistra Corp (VST) is up roughly 140% this year, while Constellation Energy (CEG) shares have risen nearly 90%, which is about in line with Nvidia's rise this year.\n\nIn a note on Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson listed Utilities as an Overweight sector, noting it offers \"upside to the AI power theme.\" Wilson highlighted that the Power and Utilities team at Morgan Stanley believes electricity could rise from 3% of total US consumption in 2023 to about 10% by 2030, driven by new AI data centers that are 50 times the size of previous ones.\n\n\"Both traditional and alternative energy providers have upside revisions potential amid the increasing need for AI data center power and more favorable data center power deals,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nAnd companies have been playing up their role in the AI buildout too.\n\nResearch from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter. More than 66% of companies in the Energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.\n\nGiven the big-picture implications, investors will be closely watching Nvidia's report for color on AI chip demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus far, Nvidia has repeatedly surprised investors on this front, continuously topping analyst expectations for quarterly results and boosting its outlook for the coming quarter amid robust demand for its AI servers.\n\nWhether this trend holds or breaks could now have repercussions for a variety of sectors.\n\n\"If markets wake up to say, 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit,' and that's reflected in those valuations,\"' JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley told Yahoo Finance, \"that's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\" Nvidia Corporation logo is displayed on a smartphone screen, with a graphic representation of the stock market in the background.

        "content": "Comcast (CMCSA) revealed the price of its recently announced StreamSaver bundle, which will package Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier (NFLX) and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\n\nThe new offering, available to Comcast’s broadband internet and TV subscribers, will launch next week at a price point of $15 a month, yielding savings of around 35% compared to the cost of subscribing to the three services separately, Comcast said.\n\nCustomers can also access Netflix and Apple TV+ subscriptions through Comcast's Now TV streaming platform, which includes Peacock and 40 other channels, for $30 a month (as opposed to $20 a month without the additional services.)\n\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\nOn average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. Streamers have found it difficult to retain subscribers over the longterm.\n\n\"One of the biggest issues the industry has faced is serial churners,\" Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley told Yahoo Finance. \"Even for the top platforms like Netflix, churn is still a very real problem. ... Bundling is a big effort to try to mitigate that.\"\n\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.\n\nDisney (DIS), which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year.\n\nThe move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney announced a new streaming bundle that will combine Disney+, Hulu, and Max, with a launch date set for this summer in the US. In December, WBD partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon (VZ).\n\nAnd earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall. Last week, the companies announced its name: Venu.\n\nStory continues Comcast revealed the price of its recently announced StreamSaver bundle, which will package Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier and Apple TV+.

        "title": "Microsoft unveils GPT-4o for Azure, new AI apps in fight against Google, Amazon",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday debuted a host of new AI features during its Build conference in Seattle, including OpenAI’s new GPT-4o, a trio of small language models, and Microsoft’s new Cobalt 100 CPU.\n\nThe announcements come as Silicon Valley turbocharges its AI investments and tech giants like Microsoft, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) race to outmaneuver one another during the biggest tech scramble in years.\n\nMicrosoft offering OpenAI’s GPT-4o through its Azure AI Studio was the company's biggest announcement on Tuesday.\n\nThe model, which OpenAI debuted during a live-streamed event last week, is multimodal and can understand inputs via text, audio, and video. That demo has since become embroiled in controversy after actress Scarlett Johansson on Monday demanded the company change the voice of its chatbot, which OpenAI featured answering questions.\n\nMicrosoft’s news also comes a week after Google debuted a slew of AI products during its I/O developers conference, including a new version of Google Search with generative AI-based responses to users’ queries. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during an event titled \"Microsoft Build: AI Day\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, Tuesday, April 30, 2024. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMicrosoft said users will now be able to develop their own copilots — essentially AI-powered programs — using GPT-4o to make apps that can respond to images, voice, and text. The Windows maker also said it will make its preview of Copilot in Azure available to all customers in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMicrosoft also showed off its Phi-3-small, Phi-3-medium, and Phi-3-vision small language models. Designed to run on devices, the Phi-3 models don’t need to connect to the web, allowing users to access them in environments where they otherwise wouldn’t be able to run cloud-based models like GPT-4o.\n\nPhi-3-vision is especially interesting, as it allows users to input images and text and then receive information about them via text outputs. So, for example, users will be able to do things like ask questions about charts, graphs, or images without needing to jump online.\n\nMicrosoft 365 is also getting copilot upgrades, with Copilot for Microsoft 365’s new Team Copilot. The app, Microsoft says, can manage meeting agendas and take notes, summarize Teams chats and answer questions related to those conversations. The app can also track user deadlines and notify individual team members when they need to take action.\n\nIn addition to new software and developer capabilities, Microsoft also said it will begin previewing Azure virtual machines running on the company’s new Arm-based Cobalt 100 cloud CPUs.\n\nVirtual machines are basically software-simulated versions of computers. So, instead of having to run 50 individual desktops, you can run 50 virtual machines on a high-powered server.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft claims that its Cobalt 100 chip provides 40% better performance than prior ARM-based virtual machine systems. In addition to the Cobalt 100 CPU, the company says it will begin offering AMD’s (AMD) MI300X chip for developers looking to train and deploy AI apps.\n\nAll of this is part of Microsoft’s effort to continue growing its cloud business through AI apps. Google and Amazon are using a similar strategy to expand their respective cloud empires as well, but Microsoft's multibillion-dollar investment in partner OpenAI has helped catapult the company to the top of the AI discussion.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Microsoft said its AI products contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter.\n\nA year ago, Microsoft first broke out its AI percentage contributions to Azure, saying it added 1 percentage point to Azure revenue at the time.

        "title": "Who Owns the Most Amazon Stock Besides Jeff Bezos?",
        "content": "According to Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) most recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Jeff Bezos beneficially owns approximately 1.12 billion shares of the company's stock, giving him a 10.8% stake in the business. As you might expect, this makes Bezos Amazon's largest shareholder, and by a wide margin. As of this writing, Bezos' shares are worth about $207 billion.\n\nAmazon's largest shareholders are institutional investors\n\nBeyond Bezos, Amazon's largest shareholders are institutional investors, as is the case with most publicly traded companies. Financial institutions that offer index funds must own a certain amount of the stock to track certain indices. For example, an S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) must own Amazon stock in proportion to its weight in the index based on the fund's total assets.\n\nSo, Vanguard is the largest Amazon shareholder, with 7.4% of Amazon shares held by Vanguard funds and their investors. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) -- also a major index fund operator -- is the No. 2 non-Bezos shareholder, with 6.1% of the company's stock.\n\nAmazon's largest individual investors\n\nAs far as individual investors go, the answer is a little tricky. Unless you're a board member of a public company, a key executive, or own more than 5% of the outstanding shares, your investment isn't required to be publicly disclosed. However, of the people in those groups, Amazon CEO (and longtime company executive) Andy Jassy is the largest reported individual shareholder after Jeff Bezos. At the end of 2023, Jassy owned 2,119,566 shares of Amazon, a stake worth about $390 million.\n\nThere's a special case when it comes to Amazon, however. MacKenzie Scott (Bezos' ex-wife) received about 4% of Amazon's shares as part of the couple's 2019 divorce. She has since sold off quite a bit of the stake but still owns quite a bit and is the company's largest individual shareholder besides Jeff Bezos.\n\nAs part of the divorce agreement, Bezos retained voting rights to Scott's shares, so they are included in his reported ownership. However, the latest proxy clarifies that Bezos' share count includes 184,282,131 shares \"as to which Mr. Bezos has sole voting power and no investment power.\"\n\nThis implies that Bezos actually owns about 938 million shares, giving him and Scott 9% and 1.8% stakes in the company, respectively.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is mainly known for its online retail marketplace, which has been a go-to website for individuals to find great deals on things ranging from large appliances to clothing, electronics and toys. If a product exists, you can be sure it can be found on Amazon.\n\nThe stock has doubled in price since its lows at the start of 2023. Shares have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and online retailer segment during this time.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN. Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?\n\nAMZN Data by GuruFocus\n\nAmazon's traditional operating segments\n\nWhen people think of Amazon, they think of their e-commerce site, Amazon Prime and Prime Video. These segments account for almost 85% of the e-commerce giant's revenue and are a very important part of its business. This is what I am including in Amazon's traditional operating segments (essentially, everything but Amazon Web Services):\n\nOnline stores - revenue generated from selling items on Amazon.com. Third-party seller services - from fees from other businesses that sell on Amazon, which includes sales commissions, fees for inventory storage and shipping fees. Advertising services - revenue generated from sponsored ads on Amazon.com and commercials on Prime Video. Subscription services - revenue from customer subscriptions to Amazon Prime. Physical stores - revenue from physical store locations. Other - includes everything else from Amazon's health care services to fees from its credit card. Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?\n\nThe growth in these segments is high, but has been slowing recently. The main reason is increased competition. Amazon was the major early-adopter in e-commerce and subscription-based shipping as well as a lesser early-adopter in online video streaming. However, competitors have caught up and have been slowly chipping away at Amazon's market share.\n\nWhat is the future of this segment?\n\nAmazon has made some changes to better position itself in a crowded market. The biggest change is including commercials in its Prime Video offerings, which started this past January. This worried investors, but it has paid off. In the first quarter, subscription revenue rose over 20% compared to the prior year, showing consumers were fine with the change and kept their Amazon Prime subscriptions.\n\nAdvertising revenue also saw a benefit from that change, growing over 24% in the first quarter compared to the prior year.\n\nThe company also recently announced these commercials will soon allow Prime Video watchers to purchase advertised products during the break. I think this is a great and innovative idea from Amazon. Competing video streaming platforms are unable to replicate this functionality since none of them have their own e-commerce store. It is also important to note that Amazon has a lot of data about its subscribers and can target their commercials more effectively than competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon in the cloud\n\nAmazon Web Services, or AWS, is Amazon's cloud service. It generates revenue through cloud computing, storage and database services for various organizations.\n\nThe company has separated out its AWS revenue since 2013 and it has grown like a rocket, gaining almost 30 times in the last decade and accounting for 16% of sales. Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?\n\nAWS is the leading provider within the cloud computing industry, accounting for almost a third of the market share. Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?\n\nThe future of AWS\n\nThe cloud services industry is expected to grow significantly over the next decade. Revenue is expected to be 20% higher in 2024 and triple current values by 2032.\n\nEven with rapid industry growth and increased competition, Amazon has been able to maintain market leadership and its 30% to 35% market share. There is no reason to believe that is going to change.\n\nDuring the first-quarter 2024 conference call, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavksy mentioned the importance of AWS and the investment Amazon is making to ensure its success:\n\n\"As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals, making bigger commitments. Still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI.\"\n\nValuation for Amazon\n\nAnalysts are forecasting 2024 annual revenue for Amazon just below $640 billion.\n\nThe company's enterprise value-sales ratio hovers around 3 historically. Morningstar analysts value Amazon using 3 times EV/sales, which I agree with. This leads to a fair value of $179.61 per share, which is currently just under 4% overvalued based on median revenue analyst estimates. Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?\n\nI think Amazon is going to outperform analyst expectations and I am forecasting revenue to be above $643 billion. At 3 times EV/sales, this results in a price target of $181. Here is why I think Amazon is going to exceed analyst expectations:\n\nTraditional segment revenue is going to be higher than analysts expect. Advertising, online stores and third-party seller services are going to drive this outperformance through targeted commercials steering consumers to purchase more products from Amazon. AWS revenue is going to maintain its position as the market leader in the cloud industry and continue its 30% to 35% market share. This will be accomplished because Amazon is heavily investing in this growing space. Amazon revenue forecasted by analysts has surprisingly fallen over the last 90 days. This is despite the company beating expectations in the first quarter.\n\nAmazon is currently trading at $186.57, which is slightly higher than my valuation of $181. Even though I think that is slightly overvalued, I like the stock as an investment.\n\nThe GF Score agrees at 90 out of 100: Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?\n\nAn option to buy-in\n\nThe most straightforward way to buy into Amazon is to simply purchase shares. However, investors have different ways to get exposure to Amazon and one alternative I really like is selling put options to purchase the stock.\n\nAmazon is currently slightly overvalued and put options can allow investors to collect some premium while potentially purchasing the stock at a specified price. As an example, we can look at options expiring at the end of May. Amazon Is Flying High, but Is It Now Overvalued?\n\nI like the stock around $181 and analysts like it just under $180, so let's focus on put options with a strike price at $180.\n\nPut options at $180 for May 31 expiration are selling at around $1.25. Options are in contracts of 100, so if an investor sold this put option, they would receive $125 to purchase 100 shares of Amazon on that day at $180. If shares of Amazon are trading above $180, the option would expire worthless and the investor would keep the $125 premium. If the price is below $180 on that date, the investor would purchase 100 shares of Amazon at $180 (which requires $18,000 in available capital).\n\nIf an investor does not have the available cash to buy 100 shares of Amazon, or if they do not want that much exposure, then purchasing the shares outright is definitely the better choice. However, getting paid ($125) to buy a stock we like at a price we want ($180) is a great way to add income to your portfolio.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Seth Klarman 2024 Portfolio: Top New Stock Picks",
        "content": "Value investing is back in the limelight as investors prepare for a higher-for-long interest rate environment. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had said in his 2000 letter to investors that while value investing might underperform the broader market amid changing investment sentiment, value investing as a basic investment principle and strategy would never go out of style.\n\n\"We are not seeking to keep up with any particular market index or benchmark. Rather, we are attempting to achieve good risk-adjusted investment results over time through the successful implementation of our investment philosophy. We continue to believe strongly in a value investment approach, attempting to buy assets or businesses at a considerable discount to underlying value. Bargains exist because the financial markets are inefficient, yet many investors lack the requisite patience and discipline to take advantage of them. A value approach may outperform or underperform the overall market at various times because of changing investor sentiment, but we believe that a value philosophy never goes out of style. When sentiment towards undervalued sectors of the market is at its nadir, it is the best time to be buying value.\"\n\nSeth Klarman is Investing in AI, Growth Stocks in 2024\n\nA cursory glance at Seth Klarman's Q1'2024 portfolio shows that the value investor is no longer limiting himself to defensive stocks with attractive valuation metrics. He's investing in some high-growth, loss-making companies as well which are expected to grow in the future. Klarman has time and again said that value investing does not mean adhering to a set pattern without any flexibility.\n\nWhat Makes a Stock Undervalued According to Klarman?\n\nIn his 2000 letter he said that he'd consider a stock undervalued if its undervaluation is \"substantial\" and there are enough catalysts to help it reach its true value in the future. Klarman also said the underlying business of the company he'd like to investing should be \"growing, not eroding.\"\n\nSeth Klarman wrote \"Margin of Safety\" back in 1991. The book, just like Klarman's investments, aged well, and after years of gaining no attention from the Wall Street, became a value investing bible and cult classic in the investing landscape. Talking about his book and investing philosophy on Capital Allocators with Ted Seides last year, Klarman said any piece of financial writing or advice should stand the test of time. He gave the example of  Security Analysis written by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, saying the companies and case studies mentioned in the book are no more, but the principles and strategies continue to stay relevant. Klarman thinks even if humans are replaced by computers, these timeless investing principles will stay valid.\n\nStory continues\n\nKlarman also said chances of making money by investing in \"widely-followed\" stocks are not that high.\n\n\"Looking at what everybody else is looking at is probably not that interesting. If you are doing to look at what everybody else looks at, look at it in a highly differentiated way. But you are not going to make money by outsmarting people on widely followed stocks with an undifferentiated opinion.\" Seth Klarman Portfolio 2024\n\nBaupost Group Returns\n\nThe media-shy billionaire, worth about $1.3 billion, founded Baupost Group in 1982. While the fund doesn’t publicly share its returns, a Wall Street Journal report last year disclosed that Baupost has returned on average about 20% annually since its inception.\n\nFor this article we scanned Klarman's Q1'2024 portfolio and chose three exciting stocks he bought new stakes in during the first quarter. Unlike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), which everyone is buying, you will see some new names in the portfolio. To see more new stocks in Klarman's portfolio, click Top 4 New Stock Picks of Seth Klarman in 2024.\n\nSoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $5,554,000\n\nValue investor Seth Klarman piling into a high-growth AI stock that has run more than 163% so far this year is news in its own. SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a California-based AI voice and speech recognition solutions company that came to the limelight following the AI revolution after the launch of ChatGPT. Seth Klarman's Baupost reported owning a $5,554,000 stake in SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) during the first quarter of 2024. In addition to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), AI-focused investors are also buying SOUN.\n\nFortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $12,194,000\n\nHealthcare solutions company Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) is one of the stocks Seth Klarman is buying in 2024. His hedge fund Baupost opened a $12,194,000 stake in Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) during the March quarter this year.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of 2023, 31 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE).\n\nIn May Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) posted Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at -$0.04, missing estimates by $0.04. Revenue fell 4.6% year over year to $662.1 million, missing estimates by $92.48 million.\n\nUnlike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), FTRE is a small company with low hedge fund sentiment.\n\nVltava Fund mentioned Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“Value can be created in various ways. Acquisition is one possibility. So-called spin-offs represent another. This involves hiving off a part of a company into a separate entity and taking it to market. One such spin-off occurred last summer with LabCorp. It spun off a smaller part of the company under the name Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE). For each of their shares, LabCorp shareholders received one share of the new Fortrea. It started trading at a fairly attractive price, so we sold immediately. Considering the price we got, we could say that this spin-off brought us some value, but it was only a one-off transaction and not a very large one at that.”\n\nGDS Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GDS)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $17,290,000\n\nChina-based data center company GDS Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GDS) is another growth stock Seth Klarman bought in the first three months of 2024. So far this year GDS Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GDS) shares have gained about 8% in value.\n\nThese were just three new stock picks of Seth Klarman. But he's buying many stocks this year.

        "title": "7 Reliable Blue-Chip Stocks That Cannot Miss",
        "content": "If you’re on the hunt for reliable blue-chip stocks to buy this month, look no further. Reliability is one of the most important factors when creating a winning investment strategy. One of the easiest ways to ensure reliability is by investing in blue-chip stocks. Blue-chip stocks represent well established companies with long track records of success. They often have a long history of reliable earnings and many times pay dividends. In short, they are among the most reliable investments available.\n\nIn general, what an investor gains in reliability by investing in blue-chip stocks, they lose in potential returns. All I’m saying here is that these firms are generally past their highest growth stages. Yes, you may be able to find faster growing firms but on average blue-chip stocks are going to win much more often.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) is the holding company anchored by Google which is itself anchored by its Google search business. Google search is again very strong which is very good news for the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors need simply look at the company’s first quarter earnings report in order to understand why Alphabet continues to be a strong investment. Google search revenues surged above $46 billion during the period. So too did YouTube ad revenue leading to strong increases in overall ad revenue for Google. Cloud growth was also impressive and overall revenues jumped from $69 billion a year ago to over $80 billion this quarter.\n\nThe stock also recently began paying dividends to investors. That’s one of the surest signs of overall stability in any company. Google pays an additional 20 cents for each share of stock owned. Silicon Valley’s Tech Giants are beginning to pay dividends and it’ll be interesting to see how they compete against one another in that regard. Growth is still the primary concern for tech companies but the Blue Chips like Google are also beginning to offer the reliability of quarterly income.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors should expect Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to perform very well in the coming months. Firstly, concerns around inflation are again easing following the April jobs report. It’s entirely likely that two rate cuts may still occur in 2024. That will pull Amazon and all of the stock market higher, particularly growth oriented tech.\n\nMore importantly, Amazon’s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts are coming into sharper focus. Recent news suggests that pressure is on in that regard. Jeff Bezos recently emailed Amazon executives prompting them to up AI efforts at the firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not to say the company hasn’t already invested in artificial intelligence – it has. The company recently concluded its $4 billion investment in Anthropic, one of the most important AI upstarts.\n\nI don’t necessarily think any of the big tech companies feel secure in their AI efforts at this stage. Each must be worried that critical errors have been made; that’s just the nature of investing in totally new technology.\n\nRemember, Amazon beat earnings by nearly 18% in the first quarter. It’s as strong a company as ever.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: Walmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) tends to be fairly steady across the economic cycle. the company can usually find a way to thrive no matter the macro environment. That is again proving true per first quarter earnings.\n\nConsumers are well aware that the cost of eating out has become prohibitively expensive in some cases. That’s a boon to Walmart’s grocery business, the largest grocer overall. Consumers are balking on restaurant eating and instead flocking to Walmart to buy ingredients for meal preparation. That’s one of the takeaways from Walmart’s strong first quarter earnings which came in better than expected.\n\nThe return to thriftiness is evidence across the economy. Other important firms including McDonald’s see strong consumer demand for value options. The company is reintroducing its $5 meal deal this summer.\n\nThat is another strong sign for discount retailers including Walmart which dominates the space. The American consumer looks to be shifting toward value again and Walmart, as we know, offers great value.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who follow MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock have become accustomed to an incredible pace of growth. The fintech payments and e-commerce powerhouse of Latin America continues that streak today and is one of the best Blue Chips to buy.\n\nMercadoLibre operates in 18 Latin American countries across five business divisions. Those divisions include A Marketplace, a payments division called Mercado pago, Personalized media division, Mercado shops, and a credit card business.\n\nThose businesses continue to grow at very rapid rates proven by the fact that Q1 net profits increased by 71%. MercadoLibre’s  success stems from its continued commitment to bring e-commerce and payments to what was traditionally an underserved Latin American market. The area isn’t growing by population but the opportunity remains large due to how traditionally underserved the area has been.\n\nFor investors who are worried that MercadoLibre shares are overpriced, consider that this metrics-based website believes they’re actually worth $150 more.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: PepsiCo (PEP) PepsiCo building in Russia. PEP stock.\n\nSource: 8ED8 / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is a snacks and beverages giant that offers a can’t miss stock for investors. It’s become evident throughout this inflationary period that consumers will remain loyal to the company despite higher prices. Another way of putting that is to say that PepsiCo benefits from strong pricing power. Even as volumes fall the company manages to increase revenues through higher prices.\n\nThat’s the power of having strong brands within your portfolio which is very true of Pepsi. The company’s North American beverages business and its North American snacks business are the primary drivers of success. Fortunately, both continue to grow on the top line basis, again despite lower volumes.\n\nPepsi gave guidance for 4% Revenue growth throughout 2024, reiterating previous guidance. That’s indicative of stability and predictability which is the hallmark of blue-chip stocks. The company also expects earnings to increase by 8% in 2024. Earnings growth in excess of revenue growth is a strong sign that the company will continue to reward shareholders.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is probably the best stock for a conservative investor seeking reliable exposure to the chip sector. Other shares like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) offer greater potential for outsized gains. Taiwan Semiconductor is their supplier and provides chips to the vast majority of so-called chip companies.\n\nI assume some investors must be worried about the general threats facing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing at this point. The threat of a Chinese invasion is one of those as is the continued onshoring threat from the United States.\n\nWell, if China ultimately invades Taiwan the results will be catastrophic for companies everywhere. There’s little that can be done to protect the company in that regard. It’s simply an unavoidable risk. The onshoring threat is a different story. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is heavily invested in U.S. efforts and is building foundries in Arizona. The point here is that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing provides the majority of the world’s semiconductors and despite any perceived risks is still among reliable blue-chip stocks to buy for that reason.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Amgen Inc (AMGN).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmgen (NYSE:AMGN) is one of the best pharmaceutical stocks to consider at the moment. The weight loss drug opportunity is the primary reason.\n\nAmgen is a blue chip stock and a member of the Dow. It’s generally seen as a reliable investment overall. However, another catalyst is currently emerging that makes Amgen an even stronger investment at the moment.\n\nThe company is one of the main challengers to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), who currently dominate the weight loss drug space. Amgen’s Answer to Wegovy and Mounjaro is a weight loss drug called MariTide. The drug requires fewer injections and may lead to longer term weight loss than the current alternatives.\n\nAmgen is one of the largest drug manufacturers globally. The point here is that the company is likely capable of garnering the manufacturing resources required to produce such high demand drugs. There’s a reasonable argument to be made that Amgen is the pharma stock that best blends stability and high upside at the moment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Netflix’s NFLX highly anticipated crime thriller series, The Victims’ Game, is set to return for a second season on Jun 21, after a four-year wait. This series, renewed by Netflix, promises a new season filled with unexpected and suspenseful murder cases linked to an incident from 15 years ago.\r\n\r\nChang Hsiao-chuan reprises his role as Fang Yi-jen, a forensic detective with Asperger’s syndrome who finds himself a prime suspect in the new series of crimes. Chang highlights Fang Yi-jen’s character development, for proving his innocence and fostering a sense of belonging. This season challenges both the character and the actor, as Fang navigates tricky situations to clear his name.\r\n\r\nThe series is led by executive producer Hank Tseng and features the return of key cast members along with new international talent. Notably, Taiwan singer Tarcy Su, Japan actor Dean Fujioka and Hong Kong actor Lau Chun-him Terrance join the cast.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have gained 31.6% year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s 1.9% decline. The outperformance can be attributed to the success of its Japan content. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNetflix, Inc. Price and Consensus Netflix, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. Quote\n\nNFLX Faces Tough Competition in Japan’s Video-On-Demand Market\n\nNFLX faces stiff competition in Japan’s video-on-demand market, which was valued at 505.4 billion yen in 2023. This marked a 12.1% increase year over year, per a report from GEM. This upward trajectory has been ongoing since 2020, with steady expansion attributed to heightened interest in home entertainment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nSome other notable players in Japan’s video-on-demand market are Amazon AMZN Prime Video, U-Next, Disney DIS and Warner Bros. Discovery WBD.\r\n\r\nAmazon recently enjoyed success with Japan survival thriller series Acma: Game, which premiered on Apr 7, 2024. Building on this success, Amazon plans to release the second season of The Silent Service – The Battle of Tokyo Bay and a live-action-drama adaptation of OSHI NO KO globally in winter 2024.\r\n\r\nU-NEXT has emerged as a formidable competitor in the streaming market, consistently increasing its market share. In 2022, it surpassed Amazon Prime Video to become the second-largest player in the market. U-NEXT's growth accelerated significantly after its merger with Paravi in July 2023.\r\n\r\nDisney is focusing on producing Japan’s content to expand its market presence. Its first Japan anime series, The Fable, was released earlier this year. Disney also has other exciting projects in the pipeline, including Dragons of Wonderhatch and Tokyo Revengers: Tenjiku Arc.\r\n\r\nWarner Bros. Discovery is expanding its footprint in Japan through a partnership with local telecommunications company J:COM. They have collaborated with DC to produce a Japan anime series titled Suicide Squad Isekai, scheduled for release in July 2024. Additionally, Warner Bros. Discovery has announced plans to produce more than 10 anime series per year.\r\n\r\nDespite experiencing slight declines in market share over the past two years, NFLX has remained the dominant player in Japan's SVOD market since 2019. The increasing demand from Japan has led management to invest more in the region. Upcoming Japan’s content from the company includes titles such as Agents of Mystery, Doctor Climax and Hierarchy. These releases are expected to boost its APAC revenues in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX's 2024 APAC revenues is pegged at $4.24 billion, indicating 12.8% growth from the year-earlier actuals. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $18.3 per share, suggesting 52.12% growth from a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy in May Before They Rocket Higher",
        "content": "The market is full of prominent stocks, but certain S&P 500 stocks rarely disappoint. I’m talking about the mega-cap giants of industry. They produce consistent profits and drive continued growth leading to capital appreciation over the long-term.\n\nThe three companies on this list certainly have the potential to rocket higher over a long-term time frame. They’re three stocks with historical charts that prove this reality. But for investors looking for quick meme stock-like gains, this isn’t the list for you. Plenty of talking heads are out there to reference for trading ideas over the next few months, weeks or even trading days.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into three S&P 500 stocks that are worth buying for the long-term in May.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nTrading in two share classes, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is among the biggest conglomerates in the world.\n\nThe Warren Buffett-led entity owns a wide range of firms, from some of the biggest technology companies, to large utilities and insurance entities. Although the stock dipped, it’s still a great buy for investors. That’s especially true, considering that the company has a whopping $29 billion cash reserve and $32 billion revenue in insurance premiums. The current trend offers a rare buying opportunity, especially with anticipated hurricane season gains.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s first-quarter 13F, filed on May 15, revealed their investment moves. The $332 billion portfolio, unchanged with 41 companies, saw Berkshire as a net seller of $17 billion in stocks. Berkshire Hathaway has holdings in Bank of America, American Express, Chevron, Coca-Cola and Apple. Also, 76% of its portfolio has all of these companies holdings.\n\nOn May 15, Berkshire announced that they have been investing in Chubb in the past nine months. With a total of $7 billion investment to date, Warren Buffet has acquired about 26 million shares. Following the announcement, Chubb shares rose 7% after trading hours.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) Q1 revenue surged 26% to over $8.7 billion, driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mounjaro saw a staggering 568% increase to $1.8 billion, while Zepbound’s sales reached $517 million. Both are tirzepatide injections, with Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity. Zepbound captured 57% of new anti-obesity prescriptions in the U.S., with a 40% market share, while Mounjaro holds 24% of the injectable-incretins segment for anti-diabetes drugs.\n\nStory continues\n\nEli Lilly’s Phase III trials of insulin efsitora in type 2 diabetes patients showed non-inferior A1C reduction compared to basal insulins. QWINT-2 focused on insulin-naïve patients, QWINT-4 on those using multiple daily injections. QWINT-2 compared efsitora to insulin degludec over 52 weeks.\n\nLLY shares have surged 309% in three years, mainly due to two breakthrough medicines. Expectations for future growth are astounding.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\\ Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancials remained strong and stable for e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its most recent quarter. Net sales came in at $143 billion, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) contributing over $15 billion in operating net income. Additionally, net income soared to over $10 billion. Despite recovering from 2022 losses, Amazon restrained cost growth to 4%, boosting profits.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI), not just e-commerce, drives Amazon’s stock growth. While online retail is low-margin, ancillary services like third-party seller services and AWS boost profitability. Despite AWS accounting for 17% of sales, it’s the main income source that supports AI applications. Amazon’s AI also helps in productivity, content creation, process optimization and customer relations.\n\nCurrently operating as one of the world’s most valuable companies, Amazon is due for a bright future. The market sees a 200% upside potential for its stock value over the medium-term. Moreover, with its strong presence in robotics and AI, Amazon could also be a worthy opponent in technological advancements.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – May 21, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: namely The Goldman Sachs Group GS, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, American Express Co. AXP and Microsoft Corp. MSFT.\n\n4 Blue-Chip Stocks in Focus as Dow Crosses 40K Threshold\n\nWall Street has resumed its rally this month after a brief pause in April as investors appear to be confident after a spate of favorable economic data, raising optimism about a rate cut soon. All the three major indexes hit a fresh all-time high last week, with the Dow leading from the front.\n\nDow Hits 40,000\n\nThe Dow gained 0.3% on Friday to close at 40,003.59, clinching a fresh record high. The index crossed 40,000 for the first time on May 16. The Dow has been on a rally since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Dow has registered 19 record closing highs in 2024. Year to date, the blue-chip index has gained 7.9% and has now ended in the green for five consecutive weeks.\n\nPositive economic data has been responsible for the Dow’s recent rally. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that inflation eased in April after increasing in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in April, lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.4%, in line with analysts’ expectations.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% sequentially in April after increasing 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Year over year, CPI rose 3.6% in April, the lowest monthly increase since April 2021.\n\nBesides, job additions to the economy slowed in April, indicating that the labor market is finally cooling. Also, U.S. GDP grew a meager 1.6% in the first quarter after rising 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023, suggesting a slowdown.\n\nA slowdown in the manufacturing and services sector PMI in April further suggested a slowing economy, fueling the rally.\n\nRate Cut Hopes Arise Again\n\nInvestors are again optimistic that the Federal Reserve will soon start its planned rate cuts. Last month, the central bank said that it’s unlikely that there will be another interest rate hike.\n\nMoreover, the Fed still plans three 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of 2024. Markets are now pricing in a 73.2% chance that the Fed will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nGiven the positive sentiment and bright outlook, investors should bet on these four fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely The Goldman Sachs Group, Amazon.com, Inc., American Express Co. and Microsoft Corp.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Potentially Undervalued?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$190 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$167. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amazon.com's current trading price of US$184 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amazon.com’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Amazon.com?\n\nAmazon.com appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that Amazon.com’s ratio of 50.69x is above its peer average of 24.64x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Multiline Retail industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Amazon.com’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of Amazon.com look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Amazon.com's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in AMZN’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe AMZN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AMZN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Amazon.com from their most recent forecasts.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy Immediately Following Strong Earnings",
        "content": "The stock market continues to prove its resilience despite concerns over persistent inflation. A lot of that resilience is attributable to strong earnings reports overall. Most of the S&P 500 has reported earnings. Fortunately, the benchmark index is growing even faster than expected, pointing to continued strengths on the earnings front.\n\nStrategists from leading investment firms continue to be optimistic about the strength of the stock market despite the Fed’s response to underlying economic conditions.\n\nThat optimism serves as a catalyst for investors seeking to capitalize on the strong earnings data in the first quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInflation declined slightly in April, offering renewed hope for future cuts. The Fed will not cut rates on that data but offers some hope following months of negative data. That data suggests investors should consider these stocks to buy after earnings.\n\nTencent (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) stock continues to surge higher following strong news related to its video segment. That strong news resulted in a big earnings beat.\n\nThe company continues to make extraordinary progress against its main competitor ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. Tencent operates WeChat, which has seen its video accounts soar of late. The company has been investing a lot of resources in order to claw back market share from ByteDance and TikTok. Those efforts are bearing fruit: Users spent 80% more time on Tencent’s video accounts, leading to a 26% increase in ad sales.\n\nThe strong performance resulted in a 62% increase in net income at Tencent. In turn, analysts expect positive earnings revisions for Tencent moving forward. That’s an excellent reason to believe share prices could move higher again in the immediate term.\n\nOverall, the news is very strong for Chinese stocks and suggests the country’s gaming and internet sectors remain particularly strong.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings on April 25, showing a more than 17% increase in revenues. Earnings were even stronger, with net income increasing by 20%. There are dozens of reasons to be positive about Microsoft stock, the earnings are but one.\n\nAnyway, March EPS figures were 3.4% higher than anticipated. Investors have grown to expect double-digit growth from Microsoft in the last few years. Thus, those same investors have to refer to the guidance in order to ascertain whether that double-digit growth is, in fact, strong. The 3.4% beat indicates it is.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft isn’t without concerns at the moment. Investors continue to wonder how successful the company will be at monetizing AI in relation to its office products. Time will tell, but investors should also realize Microsoft is incredibly strong elsewhere. Intelligent Cloud Revenue increased by 21%, soaring to $26.7 billion. The company was also successful in growing less important segments, including LinkedIn where revenues increased by 10%.\n\nImpinj (PI) Two businesspeople holding and pointing at earnings charts.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestors who followed Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) over the last few quarters have grown accustomed to strong earnings. The first quarter of 2024 has started no differently for the firm, which operates a cloud connectivity platform.\n\nThe platform includes integrated circuits that wirelessly connect physical items and data to the platform. The performance and growth of the firm have made it one of the Internet of Things companies to pay attention to.\n\nThe company reported 21 cents of earnings during the first quarter on 76.8 million in sales. Those figures were far better than the anticipated numbers of 10 cents on $73.6 million. As impressive as those numbers were, it’s the forward guidance that should truly interest investors.\n\nAnalysts had been expecting $79 million in sales in Q2 and earnings of 19 cents prior to the strong earnings. Impinj guided for $97.5 million in sales and 75 cents of earnings, blowing away Wall Street.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock remains something of a mystery following its earnings report a few weeks ago. On the one hand, earnings during the quarter were better than expected, providing reason for investors to remain positive. However, the company also gave second-quarter guidance for sales slightly below the $150 billion Wall Street had been anticipating.\n\nThere’s reason to believe that Amazon will do better than it is currently predicting. For one, AWS is now at a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Cloud is integral to so many of the current trends making Amazon immediately relevant. That brings me to my next point — artificial intelligence. I think investors will see Amazon really ramp up its artificial intelligence investment in the coming weeks. I believe that because Jeff Bezos is apparently worried the company is falling behind on that front. Thus, the company will likely react by projecting strength over the coming weeks. That could include announcements of further investments.\n\nEmergent BioSolutions (EBS) Scientist using a microscope\n\nSource: Maksim Shmeljov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEmergent BioSolutions (NYSE:EBS) is a life sciences company and stock that provides products ranging from Narcan nasal spray to anthrax injections. It’s also a company that recently reported exceptionally strong earnings, prompting potential investment.\n\nOn May 1st the company reported 59 cents of earnings on $300.4 million in sales. The market had been expecting $224.5 million in sales, leading to -84 earnings. Share prices have essentially tripled since the news was announced two weeks ago. Share prices continue to move higher by double digits, suggesting further opportunity ahead.\n\nNarcan contributed $118.5 million of the $300.4 million in sales during the first quarter. The surprise profitability during the quarter looks to have prompted a shift toward efficiency. The company concurrently announced a strategic realignment, resulting in the loss of 300 jobs as the company further focuses on its Narcan opportunity. Investing in the stock is one of the clearest ways to capitalize on America’s ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto.

Finance.\n\nThe title gets straight to the point. Although AMD beat the first quarter guidance, a weak Q2 forecast cast doubt on its shares as an investment at the moment. The story is pretty straightforward otherwise: AMD is doing extraordinarily well as it relates to hyperscalers and the data center opportunity, but gaming revenues continue to be weak.\n\nMany leading companies have announced deployments of AMD’s M1 300X chips. However, the company’s guidance is not what Wall Street was looking for. The data center opportunity continues to be strong and is expected to grow at double-digit rates, while gaming revenues are expected to continue declining.\n\nInvestors should be optimistic, as April inflation data shows the economy is cooling. That renews hope for rate cuts in the coming months, likely September, that will prompt significant increases in AI spending at the enterprise level.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is again being propelled primarily by the strength of its search business. Ad revenues from Google Search are again strong, the primary reason investors should consider buying Google. The company has again returned to the strengths that have made it what it has become over the past decade or so.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to invest in generative AI in order to further those strengths. Revenue from Google services accounted for nearly 88% of overall revenues. Those revenues increased by 13.6% rising to $70.4 billion, ahead of expectations.\n\nYouTube was another bright spot for the company. Ad revenues from YouTube increased nearly 21%, growing to $8.1 billion. Furthermore, Google Cloud’s revenues grew by more than 28% during the period.\n\nOverall, Google’s stock is again strong on the strengths of its search business. Meanwhile, the company is well-positioned to apply artificial intelligence to that segment and others. Those investments could strengthen future results substantially, which is why investors should buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "John Mackey, who sold Whole Foods to Amazon for $13.7 billion, considers the road not taken",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nWhen John Mackey wrote about “conscious capitalism” in 2013, he didn’t get much push-back. The co-founder and former CEO of Whole Foods had long walked the walk when it came to living the values he espouses. He famously capped cash compensation at 19 times average worker pay and distributed stock options widely. (Equilar reports median CEO-to-worker pay ratio among the highest-paid 100 CEOs last year was close to 300 times median worker pay.)\n\nMackey is back with a new book The Whole Story, which publishes today. It’s a reflection on how he built the natural foods chain from a single store in Austin in 1980 to a grocery giant that he sold to Amazon for $13.7 billion in 2017. He wanted to chronicle Whole Foods’ history and convey what a fun and creative adventure building a business can be. It's “not just about making money,” he says. “It's about the relationships and the team. It's about love and creating value together.”\n\nAnd he’s ready to reexamine how conscious capitalism is faring today; “it's misunderstood and being attacked on both sides,” he says. “Shareholder capitalists are attacking it because they believe it's undermining the control of business by the owners … And anti-capitalists are trying to weaponize it to take power away from the investors and owners of the business to redistribute that power to other stakeholders.” His goal: “To get people to see that business has potential for higher purpose; that all stakeholders matter.”\n\nMackey is also reflecting on the deal that forever altered the business he'd built: Whole Foods’ sale to Amazon. He says selling was the best option for Whole Foods since he was battling shareholder activist Jana Partners at the time. “I'll always wonder if we had fought Jana Partners could we have won? But [Amazon has] been a good steward of the brand…They let us drop our prices and they enabled Whole Foods to think long term.”\n\nIn addition to his new book, Mackey is launching a new health and wellness company called Love.Life focused on democratizing wellness in the same way that Whole Foods gave consumers access to more natural and gourmet food.\n\n“I found out at a pretty early age that the most important thing in life is love,” says Mackey, who took over an old Best Buy in El Segundo, Calif., to build the first Love.Life center, due to open this summer. “If you have a lot of gratitude in your life and you have a lot of love, you're going to have a lot of joy and happiness.”\n\nMore news below.\n\nDiane Brady\r\ndiane.brady@fortune.com\r\nFollow on LinkedIn\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Unstoppable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks aren't all hype. This group of tech leaders has made it a habit to deliver market-beating returns. That's why they have earned the moniker, and why investors have flocked toward these companies, sending their market caps to stratospheric levels.\n\nBut even at these heights, there remain excellent reasons to invest in some members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here are two that I think are worth sticking with over the long haul: Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms has proven that its business is incredibly resilient. Though the company struggled a couple of years ago due to mounting economic troubles, increasing interest rates, and lower advertising spending, Meta Platforms stayed the course and was able to bounce back. Revenue growth increased over the past few quarters, the bottom line got back in the green, and free cash flow is trending up, too. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nOne of the secrets behind Meta Platforms' recent comeback -- besides aggressive cost-cutting efforts -- is the company's vast ecosystem. There are few, if any, other corporations in the world with a daily active user count of 3.24 billion. That's the number Meta Platforms ended the first quarter with, and it represented a 7% year over year increase. The tech giant is receiving more money from this audience thanks to its various offerings.\n\nShort-form videos -- also known as Reels -- have played a key part. Meta Platforms uses an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered recommendation system to entice viewers to keep watching. On the other side of the coin, Meta is also utilizing AI to help companies design advertising campaigns with higher returns on investments, an obvious selling point. Considering Meta's large network of users, it's difficult to see the tech company losing significant advertising business -- in fact, quite the opposite.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms will have many growth opportunities, including AI. The company is positioning itself as a leader in the generative AI field, having released a large language model (LLM) called Llama and an AI virtual assistant called Meta AI, among other initiatives. Further, Meta Platforms is still building up the metaverse, which could be another potential massive revenue source in the future.\n\nMeta Platforms has proven to be an incredibly inventive company. Its large ecosystem of users grants it the ability to experiment with various money-making strategies until it finds several lucrative ones. Meta Platforms is currently looking to ramp up monetization on WhatsApp through paid and business messaging, for instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo long as the company remains the leading social media platform -- and its network effect will ensure that it does for a while -- Meta Platforms will be an excellent stock to buy and hold. Lastly, the tech giant now offers a dividend. Though that's just a recent development, Meta Platforms' underlying business is surely strong enough to sustain growing payouts for a long time.\n\nAnd those who opt to reinvest the dividend could see their gains increase meaningfully over time. Just one more reason to hold onto Meta Platforms' stock for good.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon started as an online bookstore before becoming the e-commerce juggernaut we know today. The company's secret has been management's ability to identify and pursue attractive opportunities, and having the innovative abilities to lead major industries in which it does business.\n\nAs it currently stands, Amazon arguably has three attractive long-term growth opportunities. The first is, interestingly enough, e-commerce.\n\nThough retail activity has shifted to online channels over the years, there remains plenty of room to grow. In the U.S., e-commerce accounted for just 15.9% of total retail sales in the first quarter of 2024, an increase from 14.9% in the comparable period of 2023. Being the leading e-commerce platform in the U.S. -- with a 37.6% market share of last year -- Amazon will benefit from the upward trend.\n\nThe website's popularity also allows Amazon to generate meaningful revenue from its advertising business.\n\nSecond, there is cloud computing, another area in which Amazon is the leader. It held a 31% slice of the pie as of the first quarter. Cloud computing can offer a range of benefits to businesses, from ease of data access to increased efficiency and cost savings. The industry should still expand by leaps and bounds, benefiting established leaders like Amazon.\n\nThird, there is AI: Amazon isn't letting this potential gold go to waste. The tech company has started offering various AI services through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. It is also building an LLM to compete with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nAmazon will also benefit from other opportunities, including video and music streaming, its investments in healthcare, and more. The company can still beat the market even with a market cap close to $2 trillion.\n\nInvestors can't go wrong with this one: Holding onto Amazon's stock for good is a great move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "As inflation remains increasingly sticky, finding undervalued stocks to buy has become increasingly difficult. Meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) continue climbing despite rapidly approaching market saturation, which could leave retail traders holding the bag when the music stops.\n\nEven if inflation cools consistently, goods and services remain significantly higher than two years ago. This discrepancy arises because inflation measures ongoing price growth rather than actual price levels, resulting in persistently low consumer confidence despite inflation rate trends. So, we’re looking at a spiraling situation in which companies pull profit from higher pricing rather than internal optimization, which seems destined for correction.\n\nThe bottom line is that meme stocks are back on the menu, and tech stocks are becoming prohibitively expensive for the average retail investor. Both conditions make undervalued stocks an attractive option in today’s market. Affordably priced, these stocks offer an opportunity for investors to accumulate shares at reasonable prices. These undervalued stocks to buy are poised for rapid growth due to favorable circumstances and bullish momentum, laying the groundwork for their future success.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) saw a per-share pricing dip in recent weeks, but it’s tough to discern why. The losses appear to result from general inattention and cooling sentiment after a stellar earnings report initially sent shares soaring. Although this might not represent a true dip, the stock is down enough to be worth buying before the next potential surge.\n\nThat upward movement could happen sooner than expected, given some unusual options activity suggesting hefty expectations for the stock within the next month. While options flow isn’t always definitive, a purchase order for 17,000 call options expiring on May 17th with a price target of $26.50 is certainly notable.\n\nHistorically, Palantir’s stock has traded within a tight range before surging and settling at or near a new floor. For a long time, that floor hovered around $15. Strong earnings pushed the per-share price to $25 before it settled into today’s lower limit of approximately $20. If the company’s earnings trajectory continues, this may be one of the last opportunities to buy Palantir at its relatively undervalued pricing.\n\nTitan Machinery (TITN) Image of the foundation and frame of a house\n\nSmall-cap agriculture and construction equipment value stocks like Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) might not enjoy the same level of recognition as larger counterparts like Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), but Titan’s robust fundamentals speak volumes. Titan Machinery recently released its fourth-quarter and year-end reports, surpassing expectations with a 25% annual sales increase and nearly a 10% rise in yearly earnings despite rising supply chain and fuel costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these strong fundamentals, Titan Machinery is undeniably undervalued, trading at just 0.19x sales, 4.8x earnings and 0.80x book value. This undervaluation is particularly stark given the company’s 79% income growth over three years. With a conservative outlook for 2025, projecting single-digit gains across its segments and a slight dip in year-end earnings, surpassing these modest forecasts could lead to a surge in Titan’s stock value. At current prices, this small-cap value stock is an easy buy.\n\nCricut (CRCT) Image of a person doing crafts on a table.\n\nSource: CRAFT24/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe do-it-yourself set may love Cricut (NASDAQ:CRCT), but the undervalued stock doesn’t get nearly the investor attention it deserves. Although revenue dipped slightly in its most recent earnings report, net income climbed 116% year-over-year, boosted by a 54.7% gross margin expansion. Cricut benefits from improving consumer sentiment, especially as buyers look for stay-at-home activities to save money and manage household budgets.\n\nIn 2024’s first quarter, overall sales dropped 8%, offset by higher paid subscriber rates and increased machine sales. This means more people kickstarted their Cricut journey in recent months, and investors can expect a corresponding sales boost as new users restock and replenish crafting supplies.\n\nNow is the time to consider buying into this undervalued stock, as management announced a special one-time dividend of $0.40 in the earnings report. Shareholders of record on July 2nd will receive the distribution on July 19th, so there’s still time to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nMedifast (MED) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nMedifast (NYSE:MED) hasn’t yet caught the wider weight loss wave affecting many pharma stocks. Still, there is long-term potential for this nutrition and weight loss company to expand its product sales across various platforms, including multi-level marketing.\n\nMedifast reported a solid $0.76 earnings per share in the first quarter. The company’s balance sheet is strong, boasting a $150 million cash reserve with zero debt, which is crucial in today’s high-rate environment. Additionally, executives are striving to differentiate Medifast from larger weight loss competitors.\n\nManagement is shifting toward a more comprehensive and holistic approach to customer management, including guided habit development and personalized coaching. Earnings statements indicate that “2024 will be a year of investment for future growth.” While this may impact the sustainability of today’s 20% dividend yield, it does not diminish the undervalued stock’s long-term upside potential.\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX)\n\nSource: Nvidia\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) may be the most objectively undervalued stock on this list, trading at just 7x earnings and 0.5x sales while remaining an overlooked player in the green tech and sustainable driving sector. The company manufactures various automotive parts that enhance emission reductions and support zero-emission technologies, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nWhile pure EV plays like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are currently losing favor due to declining consumer interest, evidenced by the surge in hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales, Garrett Motion provides a bridge for investors seeking long-term sustainability while acknowledging that global EV adoption is a long-term goal.\n\nThe recent dip in Garrett Motion’s stock followed an earnings report showing a 6% drop in quarterly sales; however, its annual sales remained stable, and the company maintained healthy margins and free cash flow. This stock is underappreciated and undervalued as investors chase more prominent growth opportunities. As automakers revise their EV planning timelines, expect Garrett Motion to become a major small-cap value stock in the future market.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-consumer eCommerce continues to soar in popularity, as demonstrated by giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT), a lesser-known but rising eCommerce force, targets the massive B2B market by creating a comprehensive platform for businesses to source products and manage all associated logistics.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing and payment processing. GigaCloud addresses these challenges by providing a complete suite of scaled B2B eCommerce solutions, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment and secure cross-border payment processing.\n\nGigaCloud’s financial metrics are particularly impressive. With a low price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.9 — well below the tech sector average of 36x — the undervalued stock doubled its earnings per share over the last few quarters and has robust free cash flow despite trading at (relatively) bottom-barrel pricing.\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen Warren Buffett vouches for a stock, pay attention. This focus makes Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) stand out as a remarkable choice among undervalued stocks, especially given the billionaire’s investment. Even as Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) appeared more inclined toward selling than buying, his $167 million investment in Sirius XM signals a positive indicator for value investors. Given the wider market skepticism, it’s an even more noteworthy play. Sirius XM remains one of the most heavily shorted stocks today at 21% short interest. So why is Buffett optimistic about this stock?\n\nBuffett’s interest in Sirius XM goes beyond planned corporate realignment; he views it as a top-notch value investment. Despite trading at low multiples, Sirius XM has a promising future. The company is a cash-generating powerhouse, with EBITDA margins exceeding 30% for the last four years and maintaining a free cash flow of over $1 billion. Additionally, Sirius XM offers a solid dividend yield of 4.69% with a payout ratio of 31%, demonstrating efficient cash management by its leadership in rewarding shareholders while strategically adjusting its market presence.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 S&amp;P 500 Stocks That Have Proven Themselves Recession-Proof",
        "content": "Since 1928, there have been 25 bear markets, or declines in the S&P 500 of 20% or more, according to Yardeni Research. Market corrections have been far more common. From World War II forward, there have been 24 drops of 10% or more by the benchmark index. The average decline is 14.1%.\n\nWhat is common to both is the relative brevity of both types of downturns. According to Covenant Wealth Advisors data, the average recovery after a correction only took four months. A bear market lasted a bit longer — some 1.4 years. The bull markets that followed, however, averaged 8.9 years.\n\nYes, corrections and crashes are painful, but the stampede that comes after always wipes away all vestiges of the downturns. The stock market ends up charging ahead to new highs. It pays to stay the course and not bail out when things go south. It is only a matter of time — a comparatively short period in the scheme of things — before things are looking up again.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, there is a market crash coming. No one knows when, but it is part of investing, and you should prepare for it. The following three S&P 500 stocks to buy should be in your portfolio today.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere should be little question about why Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is a top stock to own during a crash. The ensuing recession will have consumers searching out the best, everyday low prices to stretch their dollars. There are few better places to find that than at the retail king.\n\nWalmart has a long history of outperformance during market crashes. It returned over 23% during the pandemic compared to an 18% return by the S&P 500. Walmart also thrived during the financial market meltdown in 2008 and 2009, returning nearly 10% for investors while the index collapsed 33%. And during the dot-com implosion of 2001, it also returned 10% while the market lost 12%.\n\nBut the retail king has been a phenomenal stock to own, regardless of when you bought shares. Since its IPO, Walmart has generated a total return of 462,000%. $1,000 invested in the retailer in 1970 would be worth $4.6 million today. That would ease the pain of a few market crashes and is why Walmart is a top S&P 500 stock to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been even more resilient during recent corrections and crashes for many of the same reasons: it is an integral part of the retail economy. Especially during the pandemic, e-commerce was a lifeline to the outside world.\n\nEarly on, though, it was a somewhat different story. For example, during the 2001 downturn, Amazon was still a bookseller and wouldn’t begin offering cloud-based services until the following year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy the 2008 to 2009 crash, Amazon had evolved into a more diversified business. It had launched the Prime membership program three years prior and a grocery business a year later. It lost 3% during the collapse of the financial markets, but it performed significantly better than the broad index.\n\nBy the time of the pandemic, Amazon was an essential retail business and the backbone of the internet. So many companies and governments relied upon Amazon Web Services, which was essential and mission-critical. Amazon stock returned 76% in 2020 compared to the market’s 18% gain.\n\nAmazon has returned over 188,000% since its 1997 IPO, with $1,000 invested at the time, worth almost $1.9 million today.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical stock AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) hasn’t been around nearly as long as Walmart or Amazon. It was spun out from Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) — itself a recession stalwart — in 2013 and has done well for investors since. It has generated 660,000% returns over that time, turning $1,000 into $7,800, or 70% better than the S&P 500’s returns. AbbVie also handily outperformed the benchmark index during the pandemic, returning over 27% in 2020.\n\nOver the past year, the pharma giant has been under pressure, though it is keeping pace with the market averages. Analysts have been worried about the impact the loss of patent protection on Humira’s arthritis treatment would have on its business. Wall Street is coming to believe it won’t be as bad as feared.\n\nAlthough AbbVie won’t have the massive $19 billion in annual sales from Humira it once did, it will still realize sales of $4 billion to $5 billion a year. It’s not too shabby for a company with biosimilar competition. AbbVie also has a strong pipeline of drugs. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage on the pharma with an “overweight” rating and a $200 per share one-year price target. That implies a 20% upside from current trading prices and could be a sufficient buffer in a market crash.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in ABBV stock.

        "content": "Investors should have a wide range of companies in multiple sectors within their investment portfolio. But the backbone of any resilient portfolio that can withstand a bear market and soar during a bull market are blue-chip stocks. Companies with a strong reputation and industry-leading giants are among the most important additions for investors regarding continued growth within their portfolios.\n\nI have chosen three blue-chip stocks to buy with common traits that allow them to experience continued growth in the near term.\n\nThese are income-generation stocks that supply investors with solid dividend yields. Trading at a fair valuation and having a growth catalyst, such as increased earnings or acquisitions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nComcast (CMCSA) Image of the Comcast (CMCSA) logo on the back of a white van in a rural area\n\nSource: Todd A. Merport / Shutterstock.com\n\nComcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a leading media and technology company that offers broadband and wireless services to residential and commercial customers. It operates multiple Universal theme park locations in California, Florida, Japan, and China and owns the streaming service Peacock.\n\nOver the past year, Comcast’s share price has remained practically unchanged. However, with a strong valuation and dividend growth, CMCSA could be one of the solid blue-chip stocks to buy for investors looking to improve their portfolios.\n\nOn April 25, Comcast reported earnings for the first quarter of 2024, stating total revenue increased by 1% and adjusted net income rose by 8% year-over-year. Most notably, its free cash flow surged by 19% within the same period. Additionally, Peacock’s paid subscribers increased 55% compared to the previous year. Recently, solid revenue-grossing movies such as Kung Fu Panda 4 and The Fall Guys were released.\n\nIn this first quarter, Comcast repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares, and its wireless customer lines increased 21% year over year. Comcast’s annual dividend yield is 3.16%, which amounts to a quarterly dividend of 31 cents per share. Its most recent dividend was distributed to investors on April 1.\n\nComcast has recently experienced growth across the board with its customer base, especially surrounding Peacock and its wireless, having rapid growth. It provides a strong cash position, which is a great sign to investors. It also offers a fair valuation, with its forward P/E ratio being 9.33, while the sector average is 13.86.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a pharmaceutical manufacturer that distributes various medications and vaccines to treat cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Most notably, it provided the Covid-19 vaccine alongside BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX)\n\nStory continues\n\nOver this past year, its star price has fallen significantly by 22% following a large reduction in the need for its COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOn May 1, Pfizer reported earnings for Q1 2024, stating that total revenue fell by 20% and its net income dropped by 44% to $3.1 billion. Pfizer also reaffirmed its guidance for the full year 2024. Pfizer offers a decent dividend yield of 5.87% on an annual basis. Its most recent dividend was sent out to investors for 42 cents per share on May 8.\n\nPfizer has begun to experience a rebound in its share price within the last month. The stock price has risen by 12% with the acquisition of Seagen, a biotech company focused on oncology research and treatments. It could be a growth catalyst for Pfizer.\n\nPFE has a decent valuation with a forward P/E ratio of 12.23, below the median sector forward P/E of 19.94.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) provides a range of technology services, including software and hardware, enabling generative AI and cloud-based services to operate. Notable vendors for IBM include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).\n\nOn April 24, IBM released its Q1 2024 earnings, stating total revenue increased by 1% while net income rose 73%. However, it fell short of analyst expectations, resulting in the stock price falling by 8%.\n\nIBM also mentioned in its earnings release that it acquired HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP), a cloud infrastructure company, for $35 a share, which equates to approximately $6.4 billion in total enterprise value. The goal of this acquisition is to help improve IBM’s cloud platform.\n\nIBM also offers a dividend yield of 3.95% on an annual basis. Its most recent distribution to investors was one dollar and 67 cents per share on May 8. IBM is trading at a great valuation. A forward P/E ratio of 16.91, while the sector average is 24.22, makes it a solid blue-chip buy for investors.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "Jeff Bezos Quietly Enters Residential Mortgage Business, Giving High Interest Rate Loans To Other Investors\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nJeff Bezos may be best known as the founder of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the billionaire has several lesser-known business interests across multiple industries. Through his investment firm, Bezos Expeditions, Bezos has made several early-stage investments in companies that have gone on to become industry leaders. Some of the more notable ones include Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and, more recently, Arrived.\n\nArrived has made a name for itself by fractionalizing single-family rentals and selling shares to retail investors with a minimum investment of $100. Since launching its first property in 2021, the real estate investment platform has already funded nearly 400 properties and has over $156 million in assets under management. Bezos first invested in Arrived during the company's $37 million Seed Round in 2021, then doubled down on that investment during the Series A round in 2022.\n\nNew Real Estate Debt Fund\n\nThe company just expanded its offerings to include the Private Credit Fund, giving its investors access to a pool of short-term real estate loans made to other investors and homebuilders. Unlike a typical residential mortgage, these loans have terms ranging from six to 36 months and are used to finance real estate projects, such as renovations, rehabs or new home construction. The fund is targeting individual loans between $100,000 to $500,000 but will evaluate loan opportunities as high as $5 million.\n\nThe fund generates cash returns by collecting interest payments on the loans and distributing them to investors. The Private Credit Fund is targeting an annualized yield of 7% to 9% with dividends paid monthly. The short-term nature of the loans also allows for more flexible liquidity options than many other debt funds. After six months, investors can request a redemption of all or a portion of their shares.\n\nView fund details >>\n\nDuring the announcement of the Private Credit Fund, Arrived co-founder and CEO Ryan Frazier said, \"We launched this new product based on direct feedback from our investor community, and we’re confident that now is the right time to introduce it to investors. A number of debt investment opportunities have arisen that allow us to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns.\"\n\nGrowing Interest In Private Credit\n\nThe launch of Arrived’s new fund comes at a time when the private credit market is experiencing significant growth, particularly in the real estate sector. The current high interest rate environment along with uncertainties in the equity markets has made this asset class more appealing to investors seeking high yields and low correlation to the stock market. The number of opportunities has also increased as banks have tightened their lending requirements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 7.04%, and typical bridge loans range from 9.5% to 12%. Considering long-term government bonds are paying roughly 4.5%, residential real estate-backed loans offer a compelling risk-adjusted return.\n\nInterested investors can visit the website here to view more details about the new Private Credit Fund and invest as little as $100.\n\nThis article Jeff Bezos Quietly Enters Residential Mortgage Business, Giving High Interest Rate Loans To Other Investors originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Cisco Surpasses Estimates As It Finally Gets Some AI Action Despite Steepest Revenue Drop Since 2009\n\nOn Wednesday, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal third quarter results and both its top and bottom-line surpassed Wall Street’s estimates. However, this does not change the fact that revenue suffered its steepest decline in 15 years. Like in its previous quarterly report, Cisco attributed the sales softness by consumers setting up the equipment they received during earlier quarters, stating that it expects such installations to be mostly done by the end of the fiscal year. Despite the revenue decline, its stock still went up 8% during extended trading.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 27th, Cisco reported revenue contracted about 13% as it amounted to $12.7 billion, still surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $12.53 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings amounted to 88 cents per share, also topping LSEG’s consensus of 82 cents. But net income tanked 41% to $1.89 billion, or 46 cents per share.\n\nNetworking revenue which makes the majority of sales also melted as it dropped by 27% to $6.52 billion.\n\nCisco made a big step forward in the AI direction.\n\nDuring the quarter, the $28 billion acquisition of security software maker Splunk was completed and although it lowered the adjusted earnings per share by a penny, it also lifted revenue with a $413 million infusion. Over time, Cisco is expected to lower costs. But what’s more important is that Cisco’s acquisition of Splunk means a big boost in its cybersecurity and AI ambitions, as this is its biggest acquisition in its history that spans over a big less than four decades. With Splunk, Cisco is gaining a tool to face off its rivals, like Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CRWD), and the chance to stay relevant in a universe dominated by vicious tech titans, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon. Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google. Cisco is well-aware it cannot go alone against the giants anymore which is why it joined forces with its long-time rival Microsoft back in 2022. The response of consumers was so good that Microsoft and Cisco expanded their partnership, offering more solutions. Together, Microsoft and Cisco showed that with joint efforts, they can help their customers even better and power their digital transformation.\n\nCisco Altered Its Fiscal 2024 Guidance\n\nCisco lifted the full year revenue guidance range it provided in February, as it now expects a figure between $53.6 billion and $53.8 billion.\n\nIt also narrowed its adjusted earnings range as it now expects them between $3.69 to $3.71. As for fiscal 2025 revenue, CFO Scott Herren expects low- to mid-single digits growth rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins expressed his content that Cisco is approaching the end of supply chain challenges it has been struggling with for years. Cisco has undoubtedly been undergoing many changes and although recent quarters have been particularly challenging, Cisco is finally getting some AI action while there are early signs that enterprise spending is starting to recover.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said a good attitude and willingness to learn are important attributes for professionals looking to succeed in their careers.\n\n\"I think an embarrassing amount of how well you do, particularly in your 20s, has to do with attitude,\" Jassy told LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in a video interview published last week. \"Do you work hard? Are you more can do than naysaying? Do you do what you said you were gonna do? Can you work on a team?\"\n\nHe said having a \"great\" attitude at work \"makes a big difference\" and is \"very controllable,\" arguing it can help with finding professional mentors and supporters more easily. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy during the GeekWire Summit in Seattle on Oct. 5, 2021.\n\nBeing an \"incredibly ravenous learner\" can give people a leg up, Jassy further told Roslansky.\n\nAMAZON CEO ANDY JASSY TOUTS AI PUSH IN SHAREHOLDER LETTER\n\n\"I think that the biggest difference between the people I started with in the early stages in my career and what they’re doing now, has to do with how great they were at learning,\" the Amazon CEO said.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nJassy suggested an openness to learning should continue over the course of someone’s career, saying, \"The second you think you know it all is the second you’re really starting to unwind.\"\n\nThe comments came in response to a career advice question Roslansky had asked as part of a wide-ranging interview about Jassy’s career for the LinkedIn CEO’s \"The Path\" newsletter.

He started working at Amazon in 1997.\n\n\"I didn’t know that much about Amazon at the time,\" he said as he recounted being approached by Amazon for a job interview. \"When I came, I loved it.

        "title": "4 Blue-Chip Stocks in Focus as Dow Hits New Milestone",
        "content": "Wall Street has resumed its rally this month after a brief pause in April as investors appear to be confident after a spate of favorable economic data, raising optimism about a rate cut soon. All the three major indexes hit a fresh all-time high last week, with the Dow leading from the front.\n\nDow Hits 40,000\n\nThe Dow gained 0.3% on Friday to close at 40,003.59, clinching a fresh record high. The index crossed 40,000 for the first time on May 16. The Dow has been on a rally since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Dow has registered 19 record closing highs in 2024. Year to date, the blue-chip index has gained 7.9% and has now ended in the green for five consecutive weeks.\n\nPositive economic data has been responsible for the Dow’s recent rally. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that inflation eased in April after increasing in the first three months of the year.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month in April, lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 3.4%, in line with analysts’ expectations.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% sequentially in April after increasing 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Year over year, CPI rose 3.6% in April, the lowest monthly increase since April 2021.\n\nBesides, job additions to the economy slowed in April, indicating that the labor market is finally cooling. Also, U.S. GDP grew a meager 1.6% in the first quarter after rising 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023, suggesting a slowdown.\n\nA slowdown in the manufacturing and services sector PMI in April further suggested a slowing economy, fueling the rally.\n\nRate Cut Hopes Arise Again\n\nInvestors are again optimistic that the Federal Reserve will soon start its planned rate cuts. Last month, the central bank said that it’s unlikely that there will be another interest rate hike.\n\nMoreover, the Fed still plans three 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of 2024. Markets are now pricing in a 73.2% chance that the Fed will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nGiven the positive sentiment and bright outlook, investors should bet on these four fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely The Goldman Sachs Group GS, Amazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "Investing in blue-chip stocks is always a good idea. They might not show an immediate upside but do have the potential to navigate through the market turmoil and come out strong. However, not all stocks are made the same and you need a careful eye to figure out the best blue-chip stocks to buy. The economy is finally improving and the S&P 500 breached 5,300 for the first time after a cooler-than-expected inflation report.\n\nA rate cut could be on the way and if you want to rebalance your portfolio with blue-chip stocks that have strong buy ratings, now is the right time to do so. These stocks have proved their strength in the industry and recently reported impressive quarterly numbers. Several analysts have strong buy ratings making them hot picks right now. Let’s dive deep into them.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top blue-chip stock, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a strong buy rating from a total of 41 analysts. Currently trading for $183 and up 22% year-to-date, the stock has a price target of $220, a 19% upside potential. The e-commerce giant reported strong fundamentals driven by its cloud segment Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the thriving advertising segment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts were impressed with the first-quarter results and are expecting higher advertising and cloud computing revenue in the coming quarters. The company has been using artificial intelligence for a long time now and the management expects the demand for AI to boost the cloud computing revenue throughout the year.\n\nIt has also invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic which is the maker of Calude 3, a ChatGPT competitor. Besides the cloud segment, Amazon’s e-commerce business continues to dominate the industry. Its future is bright and the company has a solid track record of performance. No wonder analysts love the stock!\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leader in the AI industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already wearing the crown but there is a lot more to come.

The company is holding the largest market share and no competitor has been able to come close to it.\n\n40 analysts have a strong buy rating for the stock with a price target of $1,026, an 8% upside from the current level. Industry experts believe that the stock will rally after the company announces results on May 22 and recommend buying before the earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock is trading at $943 today and is up 95% YTD. The stock hasn’t been able to hit $1,000 but I believe the upcoming results will give it a boost. Nvidia is the biggest provider of chips for large-language models used for AI chatbots. The AI market is only going to expand and Nvidia will be the first one to benefit.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 36% YTD, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is exchanging hands for $473 and the stock has a strong buy rating from 36 analysts.

The revenue came in at $36.46 billion. Analysts believe that the fundamentals and the outlook both are positive and Meta has the ability to deliver.\n\nThe company’s financial results have improved significantly over the past few quarters. It has implemented generative AI features that meet the needs of advertisers and ensure higher views and conversions.\n\nMeta’s revenue is driven by the growing advertising revenue and this segment is set to expand throughout 2024. The company also has enough liquidity to keep investing in AI which will reap rewards in the years to come.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech giant Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the long term. A highly resilient company, Visa hasn’t disappointed even in times of high inflation and high interest rates.\n\nTrading at $279, the stock is up 8% YTD and has shown volatility over the past month due to the mixed inflation reports. 20 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $315, a 12% upside from the current level.\n\nThere are several reasons to bet on Visa stock. It caters to over 100 million merchants and takes a fee from every transaction made using a Visa card. This ensures steady revenue and keeps the operating costs down. As we transition towards a digital economy, Visa is set to benefit.\n\nIts quarterly results were impressive with a revenue of $8.8 billion, up 10% YTD, and the total processed transactions stood at 55.5 billion, up 11%. Visa is in an excellent position today and it has the ability to expand its market share as card usage increases.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one stock that will never disappoint you. Having reported impressive numbers, the company proved its domination in the cloud segment. Its Azure revenue increased 31% YOY. The company is investing heavily in AI and has already started seeing results.\n\nMicrosoft is constantly evolving and did not waste any time before investing in OpenAI and integrating AI in its products and services. It has introduced Copilot which has already become a huge success and recently launched the Copilot for Security.\n\nExchanging hands for $420 today, the stock is up 13% YTD and has increased 34% in the past 12 months. It is also a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 0.71%. 31 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $491, showing a potential upside of 16%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nTrading at $175, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) stock looks undervalued to me. The stock is up 25% YTD and 44% in the past 12 months. It is trading much lower than its competitors Microsoft and Amazon but has a lot of potential to move higher.\n\nAlphabet’s quarterly results were very impressive with a 15% jump in revenue to reach $80.5 billion and the net income stood at $1.89 per share. One thing to keep in mind is that Google will never be dethroned.\n\nIt is hard to imagine our lives without Google and even if competitors make similar products, they will not be able to replace the company. It holds the top position in internet search and has shown steady revenue growth in the cloud segment.\n\nOn Tipranks, 32 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $195, a 12% upside from here. The company declared its first-ever dividend this quarter and I think it is the beginning of something that will last long.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\n12 analysts on Tipranks have a buy rating for Chevron (NYSE:CVX) with an average price target of $188, offering a 16% upside. As of writing, CVX stock is trading for $161 and is up 7% YTD.\n\nThe oil and gas giant is a cash-generating machine and it has reported impressive financials due to the soaring oil prices. Mizuho has a price target of $205 for the stock which is a 27% upside from the current level.\n\nThe demand for combustion-powered vehicles will continue to grow even if we take small steps towards electrification. This will work in favor of Chevron as the production unit will expand.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it reported earnings of $5.5 billion and a 12% rise in production YOY. Crude oil was trading at $80 per barrel and this means Chevron is set to benefit. Even if the price drops, Chevron has enough liquidity to keep going.\n\nIt is a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 4.05%. Analysts are expecting a strong improvement in fundamentals this year as compared to the previous year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy: An ‘embarrassing’ amount of your success in your 20s depends on your attitude",
        "content": "Gen Z might be onto something when they say having a ‘delulu’ mindset—that is, having a perhaps unjustified belief in yourself—is the secret to success. That’s because Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy just revealed that it’s not a ritzy college degree or being the best networker that will make you stand out at the start of your career—but a positive attitude.\n\n“An embarrassing amount of how well you do, particularly in your twenties, has to do with attitude,” Jassy said in an interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky.\n\nAfter giving up on a career in sportscasting and then dabbling in music management, Jassy—who took Amazon’s helm after Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021—joined the tech giant in 1997 as a marketing manager. The Harvard Business School alumni went on to launch the cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services with Bezos. By 2020, AWS generated $13.5 billion of Amazon’s $22.9 billion in annual operating income, making him a clear candidate for CEO.\n\nLooking back, he told Roslansky that “there's so many things that you can't control in your work life, but you can control your attitude.”\n\n“I think people would be surprised how infrequently people have great attitudes,” he said. “I think it makes a big difference.”\n\nThe reason why Jassy thinks positivity determines success is pretty straight forward: People want to be around positive people.\n\n“You pick up advocates and mentors much more quickly,” he added. “People want those people to succeed—and it's very controllable.”\n\nBut a cheerful disposition alone won’t get you far, Jassy warned—aspirational workers need to follow through on a can do attidude with action.\n\n“Do you work hard? Do you do what you said you were going to do?” he asked.\n\nEnthusiasm musn’t end with your twenties\n\nIt’s easy to assume that once you’ve climbed the ranks, it’s now your turn to impart knowledge onto others. But Jassy warned that your enthusiasm for learning musn’t end in your twenties—or, when you reach management.\n\n“The biggest difference between the people I started with in my early stages of my career and what they're doing now has to do with how great they were at learning,” he said.\n\n“There are some people who get to a certain point and it almost feels threatening to them to learn,” Jassy pointed out, adding that it can highlight gaping wholes in your knowledge and make you question whether your worthy of your rank.\n\n“But the second you think you know it all is the second you're really starting to unwind.”\n\nIt’s why he’s a fan of a squiggly career that let’s you stretch your abilities and try on many different roles and industries for size.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Along the way, you'll keep picking things up if you let yourself,” Jassy concluded. “You'll wind your way around something that you're really good at.”\n\nSuccess starts on the school field\n\nBefore entering the world of work, Jassy revealed that he was an aspiring athlete. The multimillionaire told Roslansky that he spent “a lot” of his school time on the field playing “all the sports”, instead of keeping his head down and studying.\n\n“I had this delusion that maybe I could be a professional athlete,” he revealed. “I played that national tennis circuit and then I played soccer competitively—and of course, I wasn't good enough to be a professional athlete, so I'm not.”\n\nAlthough Jassy failed at realizing his sporting dreams, the success he enjoys today could be thanks, in part, to the years he dedicated on the pitch. An extensive study of U.S. Ivy League alumni has shown those who are consumed with sports—not books—in their youth go on to become more successful than their peers later on in life.\n\nThe researchers found that sporty students were significantly more likely to land finance or business-related jobs after college, more senior positions and high salaries than non-athletic students.\n\nJassy might not have known it at the time, but the research suggests that while dedicating his spare time to competing in soccer—which often relies on teamwork, communication, and accountability—he was banking skills fit for the boardroom.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Express, Walmart, Amazon, The Goldman Sachs and Merck &amp; Co",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – May 20, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Express Co. AXP, Walmart Inc. WMT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS and Merck & Co. Inc. MRK.\n\nStocks Powering the Dow ETF Year to Date\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average touched the milestone of 40,000 for the first time on strong corporate earnings and renewed bets for rate cuts. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 6.4% so far this year. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising this year, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are American Express Co., Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merck & Co. Inc.\n\nThe blue-chip index has outperformed in recent months, with the broadening out of the stock market rally beyond the tech sector. Cyclical stocks, banks and small-cap stocks have all shown an upward trend in recent weeks, powering the blue-chip index. Bouts of stronger earnings and stronger guidance from many mega-cap stocks also propelled the index (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024).\n\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is also paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\n\nInflation in the United States cooled down for the first time in six months, sparking new bets on Fed rate cuts as soon as September. Low rates are favorable for stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, around 70% of traders now expect at least one cut by the September meeting, a notable increase from a week ago.\n\nDIA in Focus\n\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $33.3 billion and an average daily volume of 3.7 million shares. It tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket, with each making up for less than 8.6% share. Financials (23.2%), information technology (18.8%), healthcare (18.5%), consumer discretionary (14.7%) and industrials (13.9%) are the top five sectors (read: ETFs to Make the Most of the Sector Rotation).\n\nStory continues\n\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks of DIA\n\nAmerican Express is a diversified financial services company offering charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services worldwide. Shares of AXP have risen 28.8% so far this year. American Express earnings are expected to grow 15% this year. It makes up for 3.97% share in DIA portfolio. It has a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nWalmart has evolved from being just a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer into an omnichannel player. It is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units worldwide. The stock has risen 21.8% this year. Walmart has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It has jumped nearly 21% this year and accounts for 3% in the fund’s basket. AMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and accounts for 3% of DIA portfolio. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. The stock has gained more than 20% so far this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 60.5% for this year. Goldman accounts for a 7.6% share in DIA’s portfolio and has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMerck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. It has gained more than 20% so far this year and accounts for 2.1% in the fund’s basket. Merck is expected to see earnings growth of 474.2% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\n\nGet it free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Pioneering in the hydrogen fuel cell tech for e-motors, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a game changer in the transportation sector.

        "title": "Buying This Magnificent Stock at $74 Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 2016",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was founded in 1994 to sell products using the Internet. Since then, it has become the dominant player in the e-commerce industry. However, the company has also expanded into other areas, such as cloud computing, streaming, and digital advertising.\n\nShares of Amazon have climbed more than fivefold since 2016, and while e-commerce remains the company's largest source of revenue, its other businesses have played a notable role in that value creation.\n\nSea Limited(NYSE: SE) is on a similar path to Amazon, although at a much earlier stage. E-commerce is the company's core segment, but it's also finding success in other areas of the digital economy, such as gaming and financial services.\n\nSea trades at about $74 per share as of this writing (valuing the company at $42.4 billion), but I think it has the potential to soar fivefold in the coming years. So, investors who missed out on Amazon might want to grab this opportunity with both hands.\n\nA triple threat in the digital economy\n\nAmazon was an early mover in e-commerce in the U.S. and Europe. Sea is based in Singapore and focuses on serving Southeast Asian markets, which are at an earlier stage in the digital transition compared to the U.S. It owns a hybrid consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer marketplace called Shopee, which is the source of most of its e-commerce revenue.\n\nLike Amazon, Sea is currently focused on optimizing Shopee's logistics network (SPX Express) through automation and operational improvements to deliver products more quickly and bring down costs. During the first quarter of 2024, 70% of Shopee orders were delivered within three days, and its cost per order fell 15% across Asia. According to Amazon, faster delivery times encourage consumers to order more frequently because they grow more confident in receiving products within a predictable timeframe.\n\nSea's digital financial services segment is headlined by SeaMoney, and it's another important driver of Shopee's success. Not only does it offer digital bank accounts and consumer loans (including the buy now, pay later variety), but it also lends money to Shopee merchants to accelerate their growth. At the end of Q1, SeaMoney had $3.3 billion in total loans on its books, up 28.7% year over year, signaling strong demand.\n\nSea also owns Garena, a leading game development studio responsible for global smash-hits like Free Fire and Call of Duty: Mobile. It experienced a consistent decline in users after 2021 when pandemic-related lockdowns and social restrictions ended. But the segment stabilized throughout 2023, and in Q1 2024, Garena reported 594.7 million quarterly active users, up 21% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strong result was driven by a 24% increase in monthly active users on Free Fire, the most downloaded mobile game in the world last quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSea's growth just accelerated in a big way\n\nSea is coming off a challenging couple of years. Its business lost momentum when global interest rates began to soar in 2022 because consumers suddenly found themselves with less money in their pockets. As a result, the company aggressively cut costs in 2023, placing further pressure on its revenue growth, which came in at just 4.9% for the year, a substantial deceleration from the triple-digit growth rates it delivered previously.\n\nBut Sea has opened 2024 on much better footing. Its digital entertainment segment remained a laggard with revenue shrinking 15.1% year over year despite the increase in users. However, its e-commerce business -- which is responsible for the majority of the company's total revenue -- generated solid growth of 32.9%. Sea's digital financial services segment also made a positive contribution, up 21.0%.\n\nOverall, Sea increased total revenue 22.8% to $3.7 billion. That growth rate was more than four times faster than its 2023 growth rate.\n\nThere is one glaring reason for the strong top-line result: Sea increased its Q1 marketing spending a whopping 92.3% year over year. And despite continuing to trim all its other costs, that was enough to lift its total operating expenses 14.8% higher.\n\nThat did create a small problem, though. Sea generated net income (profit) of $162.6 million in 2023, a huge improvement over its eye-watering $1.6 billion loss in 2022. In other words, its cost cuts had the desired effect. But by increasing its operating expenses in Q1 2024, its bottom line sank back into the red to the tune of $23 million.\n\nThat's a tiny loss on such a large amount of revenue, and Sea has $8.6 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on hand, so it can certainly afford it. But it's something investors should monitor because it would be great to see accelerating revenue growth while also maintaining profitability.\n\nWhy Sea stock could soar fivefold over the long-term\n\nAs I mentioned, Sea is valued at $42.4 billion. Based on the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $13.7 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.1. That's near the cheapest level since Sea became a public company in 2017, and it's substantially below its peak P/S ratio of 22.9.\n\nThat peak valuation was unsustainable, not to mention a little irrational, because it was based on the premise that Sea would continue growing its revenue at triple-digit rates (as it did from 2019 to 2021) for the long term. However, Sea doesn't have to grow that quickly for its stock to deliver a great return for investors.\n\nIf Sea can increase its annual revenue at a compound annual rate of 17.5% for the next 10 years, its top line will reach about $68.7 billion by 2034. At its current P/S ratio, that would value the company at $199.2 billion, which implies a fivefold return from here.\n\nWe know Sea's revenue growth accelerated to 22.8% in Q1, so it's already performing above the threshold. Plus, I think there is scope for its P/S ratio to tick higher if that growth continues, providing even more potential upside to the stock. Amazon's P/S ratio, for example, has doubled since late 2022, thanks to the company's accelerating revenue growth, so there is precedent.\n\nTherefore, investors who missed out on buying Amazon stock in 2016 -- right before it soared fivefold -- might find a comparable opportunity in Sea right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sea Limited right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sea Limited, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sea Limited wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "U.S. futures inch higher, Nvidia to report this week - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge higher after the Dow ended trading on Friday above the 40,000 mark for the first time. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is due to headline this week's corporate earnings calendar, with the maker of artificial intelligence-optimized chips expected to report another quarter of surging revenues. Elsewhere, several Fed officials are set to speak on Monday, as investors attempt to gauge to road ahead for the central bank's monetary policy.\n\n1. Futures point higher\n\nU.S. stock futures were broadly higher on Monday, suggesting an extension in a rally in the prior session that drove the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average to its first-ever close above the 40,000 level.\n\nBy 03:48 ET (07:48 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 19 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 4 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 22 points or 0.1%.\n\nRecent data indicating a possible cooling in the U.S. economy have alleviated some persistent inflation concerns, fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve will start to bring interest rates down from more than two-decade highs as soon as September. Along with the Dow, the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all touched record marks last week.\n\nThe durability of the strength on Wall Street will likely be tested by a fresh batch of corporate results this week, including quarterly returns from artificial intelligence darling Nvidia (see below). Durable goods and consumer sentiment data will also be in focus as markets hunt for more evidence that growth is moderating enough to give the Fed justification for rolling out rate cuts this year.\n\n2. Nvidia earnings ahead this week\n\nNvidia is set to highlight the earnings calendar this week, with traders keen to see if the maker of AI-specialized graphics processing units will once again post spiking revenues at its all-important data center unit.\n\nShares in the company have rocketed higher by nearly 92% this year, making it one of the focal points of the AI boom. In February, Nvidia said it expects revenues to jump to $24 billion in the first quarter, with Chief Executive Jensen Huang noting that he believed \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\"\n\nComments from Huang will also likely be in the spotlight. Nvidia faces competition from rival chipmakers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as supply chain constraints and geopolitical tensions that threaten AI chip exports from the U.S. to China. Meanwhile, major tech players like Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are reportedly beginning to build their own AI chips in-house, potentially limiting their need for Nvidia's chips.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Fed speakers, minutes on tap\n\nSeveral Fed officials are due to deliver speeches on Monday that may provide insight into the path ahead for the central bank's moentary policy.\n\nFed board members Christopher Waller, Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr are scheduled to speak at separate events.\n\nLater in the week, the Fed is set to publish the minutes from its April 30-May 1 meeting, when Chair Jerome Powell indicated that rates are likely to remain higher for longer because of lingering inflationary pressures.\n\nHowever, since then, data has shown that U.S. consumer prices -- a key gauge of inflation -- increased at a slower than anticipated pace in April, while a crucial labor market report undershot estimates.\n\nThe numbers bolstered wagers that the Fed will introduce two 25-basis point cuts to borrowing costs this year. Rates currently stand at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\n4. China keeps loan prime rate unchanged\n\nThe People’s Bank of China kept its benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) unchanged on Monday as widely expected, even as Beijing continued to roll out other stimulus measures to support the economy.\n\nThe PBOC maintained its one-year LPR at 3.45%, while the five-year rate, which is used to determine mortgage rates, was left at 3.95%.\n\nBoth rates were kept at record lows, as Beijing sought to shore up economic growth by keeping local monetary conditions as loose as possible.\n\nElsewhere, Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland Chinese property developers dropped despite Beijing announcing fresh measures last week aimed at supporting the ailing industry. China has unveiled a string of these policies in recent weeks, including a softening of home buying restrictions across several major cities and funds for local governments to buy real estate from developers.\n\n5. Crude gains amid Iran uncertainty\n\nCrude prices edged higher Monday, adding to the previous week’s gains, as uncertainty swirled around the political situation in the Middle East following the reported death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nBy 03:44 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.3% higher at $79.81 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $84.23 a barrel. Brent had ended the previous week up about 1%, its first weekly gain in three weeks, while WTI rose 2% on improved economic indicators from the U.S. and China, the world's largest oil consumers.\n\nIranian state media said Raisi, who was seen a possible successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash on Sunday in a remote region in the country's north-west.\n\nRaisi’s death comes amid simmering tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, with Israel and the militant group Hamas at war in Gaza. Israel and Iran also launched strikes against each other earlier this year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. futures inch higher, Nvidia to report this week - what's moving markets\n\nJapan manufacturers want BOJ to keep yen stable, survey shows\n\nTop Japan companies agree to 5.58% average pay hike, business lobby says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "Over the past few years, Michael Burry has gained more media attention with his recession warnings and market crash \"predictions\" than he did for accurately foreseeing the 2008 financial crisis. But his persistent warnings about recession and market crashes never realized, denting his reputation as an expert and hedge fund manager.\n\nWere Michael Burry's Recession Warnings Wrong?\n\nA cursory look at Burry's portfolio moves shows that he's becoming more fickle than ever, constantly buying stocks and then selling them after a few months. In 2022, when the inflation storm was at its peak and the market was panicking, Burry tweeted:\n\n\"As I said about 2008, it is like watching a plane crash. It hurts, it is not fun, and I'm not smiling.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Wall Street Journal analyzed Michael Burry's recession warnings and found that he's made at least five \"dire\" market predictions. But that's not the news. The news is that each time he predicted something horrifying about the market, the S&P 500 saw positive returns over the next six months. Six-month average annualized gain posted by the S&P 500 following these five Burry predictions was 34%.\n\n\"Overconfidence\" or Something Else?\n\nWhy are Michael Burry's market predictions not accurate anymore? Researchers Jerker Denrell and Christina Fang in 2010 published an interesting research paper titled Predicting the Next Big Thing: Success as a Signal of Poor Judgment. The paper talked about the reasons why experts who make accurate predictions about \"extreme\" events often follow up with more, and fail. The paper highlighted several reasons behind this trend, but one of these was overconfidence.\n\n\"An alternative explanation of our results is that a successful prediction generates overconfidence. Overconfident individuals, who overestimate the precision of their private information relative to publicly available information, are likely to make less accurate predictions. For example, Hilary and Menzly (2006) show that analysts who have predicted earnings more accurately than the median analyst in the previous four quarters tend to be simultaneously less accurate and further from the consensus in their subsequent predictions.\"\n\nDespite his recession warnings not playing out as he predicted, Michael Burry remains one of the market geniuses whose moves are watched keenly by investors. For this article we scanned Michael Burry's Q1'2024 portfolio and picked some notable stocks he sold in the quarter. These are just five stocks that he sold in the March quarter. Insider Monkey had published a long list of stocks dumped by Burry in the first three months of 2024. Some notable names include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL). Click to see 7 Stocks Michael Burry is Selling in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBig Lots Inc (NYSE:BIG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 10\n\nDiscount retailer Big Lots Inc (NYSE:BIG) was a disappointment for Michael Burry. The Big Short investor had bought 225,000 shares of Big Lots Inc (NYSE:BIG) back in the fourth quarter of 2023. The stock has lost about 53% in value over the past one year, and 9% in the last six months.\n\nGEN Restaurant Group Inc (NASDAQ:GENK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 10\n\nCalifornia-based restaurant company GEN Restaurant Group Inc (NASDAQ:GENK) is one of the stocks Michael Burry is selling in 2024. Scion Asset Management sold all 154,142 shares of GEN Restaurant Group Inc (NASDAQ:GENK) it had owned in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWasatch Micro Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding GEN Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:GENK) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“GEN Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:GENK) was the strategy’s greatest detractor. The company owns GEN Korean BBQ, a fast-growing experiential restaurant chain operating in seven states of the U.S. GENK offers customers a unique dining experience where they serve as their own chefs, preparing meals on embedded grills in the center of each table. The extensive menu consists of traditional Korean and Korean-American food, including high-quality meats, seafood and mixed vegetables. We bought GENK as an initial public offering (IPO). Afterward, we purchased additional shares on the open market. During the year prior to the IPO, we met with the management team and visited the restaurants several times—and our qualitative assessment was extremely positive. In terms of our quantitative assessment, we were impressed with GENK’s contribution margins in the vicinity of 20% and its EV-to-EBITDA valuation, which was below high-quality peers in the restaurant business. For the most part, the company’s fundamentals have progressed in line with our initial expectations. And every one of GENK’s 36 locations generates positive cash flow. But small operational improvements are needed in seven locations. Unfortunately, investors are inherently impatient with a newly public company that isn’t firing on all cylinders. While we’re disappointed that GENK stumbled in the aftermath of its IPO, we remain comfortable investing alongside company insiders, who still own 87% of the outstanding shares.”\n\nQurate Retail Inc Series A (NASDAQ:QRTEA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nMichael Burry sold all 600,000 Qurate Retail Inc Series A (NASDAQ:QRTEA) shares he had in his portfolio in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nSilver Ring Value Partners stated the following regarding Qurate Retail, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRTEA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Qurate Retail, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRTEA): I let our remaining call options expire in January, and have not replaced them. The company is now a turnaround that is dealing with a stretched balance sheet and a potential recession. I have not yet been able to discern material evidence that the turnaround is already succeeding. Meanwhile, if the cycle were to occur sooner and be deeper than currently expected, the equity would quickly become worthless.\n\nIt’s tempting to double-down on one’s bets especially when there is such a huge amount of upside if the company is able to turn itself around and avoid bankruptcy. After all, there is still the chance of the equity being worth $10+ vs. the under $1 share price. However, merely being lured by the large upside is a mistake – lottery tickets also have huge upside relative to the price paid, but they are known for their negative expected value. At this point I don’t have any differentiated insights that would allow me to assign probabilities better than the market to the various scenarios, and so I am going to avoid gambling and pass.\n\nI will keep monitoring the situation and if there are signs that the turnaround is succeeding, I would be happy to revisit my decision even at a much higher price. In turnarounds, the best expected return is usually obtained when the odds have shifted in the company’s favor even if the upside has been reduced.”\n\nLike QRTEA, Burry is also selling Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nNexstar Media Group Inc (NASDAQ:NXST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nMichael Burry had started cutting his stakes in Nexstar Media Group Inc (NASDAQ:NXST) in the fourth quarter of 2023. But in the March quarter this year, he sold the entire 32,500 shares of the Texas-based media company.\n\nOver the past one year the stock has gained about 5.7%.\n\nBurr is also dumping major names like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nBruker Corp (NASDAQ:BRKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nScientific instruments company Bruker Corp (NASDAQ:BRKR) is in our list of the stocks Michael Burry is selling in 2024. Burry had bought 50,000 shares of Bruker Corp (NASDAQ:BRKR) in the last quarter of 2023, only to sell all of them in the following quarter. Over the past six months Bruker shares are up 22%.\n\nThese were just 5 stocks Michael Burry sold in 2024. He's selling many more this year.\n\nClick to see 7 More Stocks Michael Burry is Selling in 2024.\n\nDisclosure.None.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Dow at 40,000: Why stocks still have 'plenty of room to run'",
        "content": "Investors are catching the bull by the horns.\n\nThat’s the sentiment gripping Wall Street, as stocks notch record highs and the market is on track for its best month of the year.\n\nA late surge in the final stretch of trading pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJIA) to close above 40,000 for the first time ever Friday — a milestone that comes just 874 trading days after the Dow first closed above 30,000.\n\nThe blue-chip index added 1.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both recorded their longest weekly winning streaks since February.\n\n“Psychologically it's amusing,” JPMorgan Asset Management’s Jack Manley said of the milestone on Yahoo Finance’s ‘Morning Brief.’\n\n“The rally feels good because the macro data has been pretty good,” he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS), Microsoft (MSFT), and UnitedHealth (UNH) were the top three point contributors to the Dow’s charge from 30,000 to 40,000.\n\nAnd the makeup of the Dow looks different than it did during previous milestones. The index most recently replaced Walgreens (WBA) with Amazon (AMZN), bringing it to its current composition.\n\nThis week’s softer inflation print helped bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates before year end, as more investors place their bets on a soft-landing.\n\nIn a note to clients this week, Truist co-chief investment strategist Keith Lerner wrote the recent rally is a “healthy sign and typical characteristic of a bull market,” suggesting “upside potential remains.”\n\nAnd Lerner is not alone. Top Wall Street strategists tell Yahoo Finance that the run is far from over, although the ride ahead may be bumpy for investors.\n\n“The screens are green and the skies are blue … there's more upside,” BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance. “But that doesn't mean that stocks are going to be linear forever. We are going to see some sort of a normal correction and that's a better buying opportunity.”\n\nBelski warns that a more significant pullback than the 5.5% drawdown earlier this year is likely — before bouncing back to a higher base. He raised his 2024 year-end forecast to a Street high of 5,600; the S&P 500 closed just above 5,300 this week.\n\n“The fourth quarter in particular, especially post-election, will do very well,” Belski added.\n\nA growing list of strategists have raised their S&P year-end targets. As it stands today, more than half of the strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have year-end targets at or above 5,300.\n\nManley sees the market gaining another 5% to 10% from current levels, as long as “the economy is doing well” and earnings “catch up.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Big tech names have really been pulling their weight but we need the rest of the index to start playing ball too,” Manley said. “That’s a back-half story, and I think it helps to lift the market just a bit higher.”\n\nStrong earnings are a key part of the Street’s bullish narrative. As of Friday afternoon, the S&P 500 is on track for earnings growth of 5.7%, the highest earnings growth rate since Q2 2022, according to FactSet. Looking ahead, analysts expect year-over-year earnings growth rates of 9.2% for the current quarter, and 11.1% for fiscal 2024.\n\nNewton Investment Management chief investment officer John Porter told Yahoo Finance he expects the breadth of the earnings improvement to continue beyond big tech, leading to a broadening rally.\n\nOf the 30 best performing stocks on earnings this season, only five came from the tech sector, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment.\n\n“The resiliency of the market in the face of much more modest rate cut expectations is very impressive,” Porter said of the 2024 rally. “As long as the market continues to feel the next move from the Fed is a rate cut, I think you've got good support for the broad market.”\n\nWhile it’s up for debate how much higher stocks can go from here, Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick wrote in a post on X that based on historical analysis, stocks were up 20% on average each time in the year after the Dow hit 10,000, 20,000 and 30,000.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Invest Like a Hedge Fund King: 3 Stocks Backed by Paul Tudor Jones",
        "content": "Today, we delve into the world of hedge fund titan Paul Tudor Jones and explore three Paul Tudor Jones stocks that offer a glimpse into his investment strategy. Jones has a knack for spotting opportunities in overlooked corners of the market. His investment philosophy, which balances macroeconomic insights with quantitative analysis, has guided Tudor Investment Corp. to remarkable heights. All across the globe, investors are seeking out stocks backed by Paul Tudor Jones.\n\nFrom technological advancements to shifts in consumer behavior, the variables influencing stock performance on Wall Street are numerous. However, Paul Tudor Jones’ recent moves highlight his confidence in specific sectors that promise robust growth and stability. These include technology, green energy, and consumer goods—areas that not only align with current market trends but also resonate with forward-thinking investment strategies.\n\nMany on Wall Street note that the firm’s approach is meticulous, focusing on diversification, market timing, and, most importantly, resilience in the face of market volatilities. For those looking to invest like a hedge fund king, understanding the dynamics behind Jones’ choices is important. Therefore, today we discuss three Paul Tudor Jones stocks and exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), handpicked from his portfolio, representing a unique blend of stability and growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks Backed by Paul Tudor Jones: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong Paul Tudor Jones stocks we are covering is the diversified health care company UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). The business operates through four main segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. These units focus on a wide range of health care needs, from insurance coverage and benefits to pharmacy care services and health management solutions. UnitedHealth’s integrated business model allows it to serve millions of patients, leveraging vast data insights while managing costs effectively.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, UnitedHealth Group reported strong performance across its business segments. As a result, revenues came in at $99.8 billion, up nearly $8 billion year-over-year (YoY). Management grew its commercial benefits significantly, adding 2 million more people. Optum Health is on track to expand its value-based care arrangements, while Optum Rx saw a 12% revenue growth. Despite challenges such as the recent cyberattack, the company reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, UnitedHealth Group is focused on modernizing the health care system and expanding its value-based care offerings, which are expected to drive sustainable long-term growth. The reaffirmed long-term earnings-per-share (“EPS”) growth objective of 13-16% highlights the company’s confidence in its strategic direction and operational capabilities. In addition, UnitedHealth Group’s significant investments in technology, particularly in data analytics and telehealth, are expected to drive future growth.\n\nYear-to-date, UNH stock has traded flat, in part due to Wall Street concerns over the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Meanwhile, the current dividend yield is 1.4% and the shares are trading at 19 times forward earnings. Analysts are eyeing an upward move of over 8% in the 12 months ahead. If you’re looking for a robust business model and a strategic approach to growth and innovation in the health care market, then UnitedHealth Group stock needs to be on your radar. Easily, this is one of the best stocks backed by Paul Tudor Jones.\n\nZoetis (ZTS) a magnifying glass enlarges the Zoetis logo on a website\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnimal health heavyweight Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is the next company among our featured Paul Tudor Jones stocks. The company develops animal health medicines and vaccines, serving a large market, including livestock and companion animals.\n\nAt present, Zoetis has a market capitalization (cap) of approximately $80 billion. Zoetis’s first quarter of 2024 was marked by a 12% operational revenue growth and a 15% increase in adjusted net income. The company has raised its operational guidance for 2024. There has been strong demand for its companion animal products and robust performance across its parasiticide and dermatology franchises. The launch of new products like Librela and Solensia for osteoarthritis in dogs and cats has also contributed to recent growth.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Zoetis’s financial performance, projecting a steady increase in EPS” in the coming years. For the fiscal year 2024, the mean EPS estimate stands at $5.77. Expectations rise to $6.37 by 2025 and $7.02 by 2026. Meanwhile, Zoetis continues to expand its presence in emerging markets, where the demand for animal healthcare products is growing rapidly. The company’s focus on countries such as China, Brazil, and India positions it well to capture growth opportunities in these regions.\n\nYet, so far in 2024, ZTS stock has declined about 11.5%, while the shares are changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings (“P/E”) ratio of 30x. Finally, the current 12-month price forecast suggests a potential increase of over 25%. Interested readers should also note the dividend yield of 1%.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) S&P 500 on wooden blocks as someone turns an arrow pointing either up or down. SPY stock. Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Dmitry Demidovich / Shutterstock\n\nWe end our discussion of Paul Tudor Jones stocks with an ETF, namely the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), which gives access to the S&P 500 index, the barometer for the U.S. market. The index, managed by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), is a market-capitalization-weighted index comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies stateside. It covers approximately 80% of available market cap. As of May 2024, the total market cap of the S&P 500 stands at approximately $44 trillion. About a year ago, it was around $34 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is one of the widely traded and largest ETFs in the world. At present, SPY manages over $525 billion in assets. In terms of sectors, information technology leads the list with 30%. Then we see financials (30%), health care (12%), communication services (9%), and industrials (8%), among others. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are SPY’s four largest holdings, comprising about 22% of the fund’s roster.\n\nAs of date, SPY has posted a YTD gain of approximately 11%. This alignment with the resturn of the S&P 500 index underscores the ETF’s effectiveness in providing exposure to the index. Potential investors should also note the dividend yield of 1.3% and the annual expense ratio of 0.09% for SPY while they may consider the fund as a Paul Tudor Jones stock.

        "title": "3 Billion More Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock",
        "content": "Investors keeping tabs on Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) likely already know it's now waist-deep in the advertising business. In 2023, it collected a total of $47 billion from third-party sellers looking to feature their products more prominently at Amazon.com. That's a $10 billion improvement on 2022's tally, and nearly one-tenth of last year's top line. Not bad.\n\nWith this particular business's growth finally starting to slow, though, the e-commerce giant is revving up another growth engine. It's still an advertising venture. But this time the medium is video. A handful of pros believe the television commercial market could be worth $3 billion to Amazon, although this expectation may actually understate what's in store.\n\nAmazon dives into the deep end of the advertising pool\n\nYou read that right. Amazon is now in the television advertising game. In January, it finally added an ad-supported tier to its Prime streaming service. Any Prime member looking to avoid these video ads must pay an additional $2.99 per month.\n\nIt wasn't exactly a shocking move at the time. Most other streaming services now offer ad-subsidized options, as the cost of content is growing faster than consumers' budgets.\n\nWhat is shocking, however, is how seriously the company is taking this business. Just last week, Amazon made its first-ever appearance at this year's so-called \"Upfronts,\" where traditional television names like Walt Disney and NBCUniversal tout and then -- hopefully -- sell television commercial time to advertisers. Increasingly, of course, streaming video ads are displacing commercials airing on traditional cable platforms. Still, the company's presence at the event turned heads.\n\nBut how much of this ad revenue could Amazon win over? It depends on whom you ask. Market research outfit Omdia believes Prime Video will do $2 billion worth of advertising business this year. Analysts with TD Cowen put the figure at $3 billion.\n\nBoth outlooks, however, may understate what's actually in store given the past and projected growth of the ad-supported streaming market.\n\nAVOD is now fully in the mainstream\n\nWhile at one point you might have been a cable TV customer, statistically speaking, now you're not. Data from Leichtman Research Group suggests that less than half of all U.S. households are still paying for linear cable television service, echoing numbers from eMarketer.\n\nWhere are they going? It's not tough to guess. These people are replacing cable with a collection of streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, and the aforementioned Amazon Prime. Consumer-tech market research outfit Parks Associates indicates the average American household now pays for an average of 5.6 streaming services.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot all of these services are ad-free, however. In fact, most of them aren't. Reflecting efforts to defray the ever-rising costs of streaming subscriptions, Parks adds that half of U.S. households now regularly use an ad-supported streaming service. These numbers will only grow going forward as these platforms improve and household budgets are stretched.\n\nAdvertisers are, of course, following the crowd wherever it goes. That's why Coherent Market Insights believes the worldwide, ad-supported, video-on-demand (or AVOD) market will more than double in size between last year and 2030, when it will be worth $71 billion. North America is and should remain the world's top AVOD market, accounting for nearly 40% of this business.\n\nGiven Nielsen's numbers indicating Prime is the United States' second-most-watched ad-subsidized streaming service -- second only to Netflix -- it's not a stretch to suggest that Prime's 115 million U.S. customers leave Amazon in good position to capture a large share of the ad-supported video market's growth. A similar situation applies outside of the U.S.\n\nThe kicker: Amazon can offer its advertisers a treasure trove of digital data about the people watching Prime's programming, allowing ads to be far more effective than they'd ever be airing on traditional cable television.\n\nIndirectly bullish for Amazon stock too\n\nGiven the size of the domestic and global ad-supported video market, $3 billion worth of additional ad revenue seems pessimistic. Indeed, it seems unlikely Amazon would bother unless it wasn't certain it could reap considerably more than $3 billion per year by tiptoeing into the television commercial arena.\n\nJust for the sake of argument, though, let's say TD Cowen's figure is on target. Even then, there's a clear additional fiscal benefit to Amazon's foray into this new business. That's retention of the company's top e-commerce customers. See, Prime members are estimated to spend about twice as much at Amazon.com as non-Prime shoppers do. Making it more affordable to remain a Prime member would be a wise investment on Amazon's part even if it wasn't going to add any additional advertising revenue.\n\nThe company is, however, going to see at least some revenue from Prime's nascent advertising business. So, connect the dots. The case for owning Amazon stock was already pretty good. Now, it just got a little better.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks in May 2024",
        "content": "Jim Cramer on Friday analyzed the market rally following the latest CPI data which showed inflation was easing in April. Cramer said bears are clearly fighting an \"uphill\" battle and unless they could get any clear sign that inflation is heating up, he expects the rally to continue.\n\nCramer Thinks The Market is \"Outrageously Bullish\"\n\nIn another program last week Cramer said this market feels \"almost blasphemous\" to him because it's led by an \"outrageously bullish\" combination of stocks, many of which he believes don’t deserve to rally.\n\nJim Cramer said that the NASDAQ, S&P 500 and the Dow recently touching record \"defies\" the conventional wisdom on \"what could happen\" at this stage of the business cycle.\n\n\"Shut Up and Drive\"\n\nCramer yet again let it out on the bears and market skeptics, saying the bears \"have had it wrong.\" Cramer said when you look at the stocks they tell you that market naysayers continuously warning about a hot economy, high CPI, budget deficit and low consumer sentiment are \"awful.\" According to Cramer, the stocks are saying:\n\n\"Shut up and drive!\"\n\nJim Cramer highlighted that in the past, when one group of stocks was going higher, usually its opposite camp declined. But this trend has been defied in the recent market rallies where apparently \"mutually exclusive\" group of stocks are surging at the same time — banks, tech, industrials, utilities, to name a few.\n\nCramer Awaits the \"Biggest Earnings Report of the Entire Year\"\n\nCramer is also on tenterhooks, waiting for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings, which he called the \"biggest earnings report of the entire year.\"\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired in May and picked 5 stocks he's recommending investors in the current environment. Instead of Cramer's famous picks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), you will see some new, lesser-known names in the list.\n\nMind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 4\n\nMind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD) is working on treatments for psychiatry, addiction, pain and neurology. Cramer said in a latest program that he likes any company working on treatments that help people \"do good\" and \"get rid of pain\" without getting them \"hooked.\" He also said that he is a \"believer\" in Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD).\n\nHe also said he doesn’t \"care\" if such stocks don't make a lot of money for now because people should \"recognize\" that this is an \"unmet need\" and it \"will make money in the end.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nWhile talking about IT consulting company Accenture, Jim Cramer said in a latest program that he thinks SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is better than Accenture.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). The most notable stake in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $983 million stake in the company.\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is up about 28% so far this year.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance during the first quarter were SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), Apple (not owned), and Amazon.\n\nAfter delivering a robust fourth quarter, SAP’s stock price again rose significantly in the first quarter of 2024 on solid 4Q23 earnings and full-year guidance that was revised modestly higher. Importantly, SAP’s transition to the cloud (a core part of our thesis on the business) continues at pace, and the company is seeing both strong cloud revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins. Management is guiding cloud sales growth through 2025 in the mid-20% range, which we view as reasonable and attractive. We view SAP as one of the more resilient software business models as it is an essential part of their customers’ day-to-day operations and cannot easily be turned off or scaled back. Additionally, we think CEO Christian Klein is honest, competent, and long-term minded— traits we value highly in leadership.”\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nWe recently covered that Jim Cramer was in a wait-and-see mode on Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) ahead of a key decision in which Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) was expected to give a verdict on its hefty dividend and business outlook. Cramer was expecting the company to cut its dividend, which he believed would be a logical decision to make. Lo and behold, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) rattled investors by slashing its dividend by a whopping 80%. After the cut, while the stock tumbled to new lows, Cramer sounded bullish on the stock, expressing his full trust in CEO Sandra B. Cochran.\n\nCramer thinks Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks at All-Time Highs I'd Buy Right Now",
        "content": "While it's tough to argue that most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks would be bad long-term investments, there are two in particular that I'd be eager to buy right now. Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is trading at just 2% below its all-time high, but its profitability is still in the relatively early stages.\n\nThe other is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google. Alphabet actually just reached a fresh all-time high as I'm writing this (on May 16), and its recent results gave investors a lot to smile about.\n\nHere's a rundown of why I'd buy both of them right now (I already own Amazon) despite the strong recent performance.\n\nAmazon's business has been impressive recently\n\nAmazon is a company that doesn't need much of an introduction, with a dominant share of the U.S. e-commerce market and the leading cloud services business (AWS). Long-term investors have been handsomely rewarded for their patience, but the company could still have lots of room to grow on both sides.\n\nOn the e-commerce side of the business, Amazon.com is the clear leader, with a larger e-commerce market share in the United States than its next 10 competitors combined. But e-commerce only makes up about 15% of U.S. retail sales today, and even lower percentages in some of the other markets where the company operates. And while Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cloud services leader, the global cloud computing market is about $500 billion in size as of 2023 but is expected to grow to five times that level by 2032.\n\nNot only does Amazon still have a ton of growth potential, but CEO Andy Jassy's plans to improve efficiency are starting to pay off. In the most recent quarter, Amazon's operating income more than tripled year over year, driven by especially strong growth in AWS as well as advertising revenue, both of which are high-margin businesses.\n\nAn absolute cash machine with room to grow\n\nUnlike Amazon, Alphabet is already a massively profitable business. Its main subsidiary, Google, owns some of the most dominant platforms and applications in the world, including the massive Google Search business, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, Android, and much more. It also has the Google Cloud business, which is a direct competitor to AWS.\n\nWhile some of Google's businesses are quite mature, there's still a lot of room to optimize its advertising business, which is the primary way its non-Cloud businesses make most of their money. And we've already mentioned the massive growth potential of cloud services over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne thing to realize is that all of Google's businesses have incredible margins. Over the past four quarters, Alphabet has produced a 26% net margin. In 2023, Alphabet generated net income of nearly $74 billion, and the company has about $108 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. So not only does the company have plenty of financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities, but it returns tons of capital to shareholders through buybacks, and it just declared its first-ever dividend.\n\nAn all-time high doesn't mean the same thing as \"expensive\"\n\nTo be sure, these aren't cheap stocks. Alphabet trades for roughly 30 times forward earnings expectations, and Amazon's P/E is significantly higher. Combined, they have market caps in excess of $4 trillion.\n\nHowever, one important concept for investors to know is that a high price doesn't necessarily mean a stock is expensive. These are two proven winners with lots of future growth potential, and I wouldn't be surprised if both produced market-beating returns for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "From AI to Robotics: 3 Stocks With the Potential to Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Whenever the largest, most powerful companies in the world are all investing heavily in a specific trend, investors need to take notice. Over the past year, that trend has been artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous robotics. Some may call it a bubble, while others are focused on it being the next technological revolution. If all goes according to plan, robots will be able to eliminate most mundane human jobs within the next few decades.\n\nSo where should investors start with AI and robotics stocks? Usually, the established industry leaders are the best targets. In this case, big tech stocks with plenty of cash flow and a well-developed base of existing users. If you have been wondering about which robotics stocks to research, start with these three foundational AI companies that every investor should own.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is the global leader in robotic surgery equipment with more than 8,800 of its da Vinci Surgical Systems in use worldwide. The current price of ISRG sits near the bottom of its one-year analyst price target range. If we take the average analyst price target, ISRG has about a 10% implied upside from today’s price of $386.70.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe da Vinci Surgical System is nothing short of a medical marvel. The units have already performed over 14 million procedures and have been peer-reviewed in more than 38,000 articles. Today, there are four different generations of da Vinci models, each with its unique use cases and specializations. Not only are these units precise and easy to use, they can be used remotely by the best surgeons from anywhere in the world.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is a profitable company, which isn’t always something you can say about medical technology companies. It trades at a fairly expensive valuation at 18.9x sales and 61.7x forward earnings but you are getting a 14% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for net income over the past decade. It’s pricey, but ISRG is the proven industry leader in surgical robotics and is in a position to continue compounding over the next years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a company that needs no introduction. It is the world’s largest e-commerce and cloud computing company and is used by millions of Americans daily. Amazon has the potential to be the world’s most valuable company one day and analysts agree. The average analyst price target is $226.66, which represents about a 20% upside while the street-high target of $500 is nearly 200% more.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen it comes to robotics and AI, Amazon is a great place to invest your money. The company already has over 750,000 robots helping humans in Amazon’s massive distribution centers. The complexity and efficiency of Amazon’s robotic systems are also a testament to the power of the AWS cloud infrastructure which will also help shape the AI industry as well. Generative AI and large language models are just some of the technologies already being built using Amazon’s AWS platform.\n\nDespite having the second-largest annual revenue in the world, Amazon is trading at just 3.36x sales. This is even more impressive considering that Amazon is trading at all-time high prices. It becomes more attractive when you realize that it’s also grown its revenue at a CAGR of 22% over the past ten years. Whether it is AI or robotics, Amazon is positioned to be the global leader in both.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest company by market cap and the leader in enterprise software. Analysts are bullish on Microsoft even as a $3 trillion company with 53 of 54 recommendations in April rated as Buy or Strong Buy. The average price target of $472.39 represents nearly 15% upside, while the highest price target on Wall Street of $550 is nearly 40% higher than today’s price.\n\nWhy is Microsoft a play on AI and robotics? The company proactively formed a partnership with ChatGPT’s creator OpenAI. The two companies have worked fast to integrate GPT into Microsoft’s suite of applications.\n\nHow cheap is the largest company in the world? Fairly reasonable! Shares of MSFT trade at about 13x sales and only 31x forward earnings. Microsoft has seen a 14% revenue CAGR over the past five years. It expects to see sales increase even further thanks to its work with OpenAI. This valuation and growth should put this stock on any investor’s buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Could Skyrocket in 2024",
        "content": "Investors have already seen some big stock price jumps in 2024. Several winners are in the popular artificial intelligence (AI) space, of course, with companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms posting excellent year-to-date returns. But there are also a few top stock performers that might surprise you. Chipotle is one of the 10 biggest gainers so far this year, for example.\n\nThe fast-food giant's growth illustrates how excellent returns can be found in any industry and are often surrounded by mediocre performances among peers. Let's look at a few standout growth stocks, then, that seem primed for big gains ahead this year.\n\n1. Navigate toward growth\n\nGarmin(NYSE: GRMN) shares are already beating the market so far in 2024, but there's room for more growth ahead. The navigation technology specialist in early May announced stellar sales results across its diverse product portfolio. Revenue jumped 40% in its fitness wearables segment and improved by 11% in its smartwatch division. Sales were up a healthy 20% overall even as many consumer tech giants (like Apple) struggled to boost revenue.\n\nGarmin isn't having trouble profiting from its growth, either. Gross profitability rose to 58% of sales from 57% of sales. Operating profit jumped to a blazing 22% of sales from 17% of sales a year earlier, helping earnings rise by nearly 40%. \"We attribute these noteworthy results to our strong product portfolio and the robust demand trends that we have been experiencing,\" CEO Cliff Pemble said in a press release.\n\nMost Wall Street pros see revenue rising by 12% this year, but Garmin could beat those projections with a strong holiday season performance. In any case, shareholder returns are likely to be solid as the company continues gaining market share while boosting profit margins above 20% of sales.\n\n2. Amazing returns\n\nAmazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) business can still expand from here despite its already massive sales footprint. The e-commerce giant most recently achieved 13% higher sales to push first-quarter revenue up to a healthy $143 billion. That growth came mainly through a surging services sector. Its Amazon Web Services sales jumped 17%, and AWS is now running at an annual rate of $100 billion with help from soaring demand for AI-powered cloud services.\n\nAmazon has a great shot at expanding its software-as-a-service platform over the next few years as more companies modernize their tech infrastructures. The e-commerce segment provides solid economics thanks to Amazon's massive scale. Add the Prime subscription service, streaming video, and digital advertising, and there's no shortage of growth areas. \"It's very early days in all of our businesses,\" CEO Andy Jassy told investors in late April.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe even better news for investors is that Amazon is finally allowing its growth to translate into significant financial wins. Free cash flow in the past year has been $50 billion, up from an outflow of $3 billion a year earlier. Profit more than tripled last quarter to $10 billion.\n\nThe stock's valuation is still attractive, too. Shares are priced at 3.4 times sales today or about double the low that investors saw in early 2023. However, that still translates into a discount from the P/S ratio of over 4 through the later stages of the pandemic. Amazon should deliver strong returns for long-term investors at that price in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Garmin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Garmin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Garmin wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "You're, of course, familiar with e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). It's one of the world's biggest companies (as measured by market cap), while its stock is one of the market's best-performing equities since the company went public back in 1997, up nearly 250,000% from that point. You may even be a shareholder.\n\nAs the adage goes, though, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Although Amazon stock's historical performance is nothing less than incredible, there are more promising prospects for the foreseeable future. Here's a closer look at three of these better bets.\n\nAlibaba\n\nDon't panic if you already own a stake in Amazon. It's still a powerhouse company. You'll be fine.\n\nIf you have some idle cash you're ready to put to work with some new stock picks, though, consider stepping into the Amazon of China. That's Alibaba(NYSE: BABA), the parent company of China's e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao.\n\nAny investor keeping tabs on China in general -- and Alibaba in particular -- likely knows the past few years have been tough. China's economy has been struggling due to the lingering impact of extended COVID-19 lockdowns. And Alibaba itself has been mired in internal challenges. It's teased the idea of divesting its cloud computing and logistics arms, for instance, suggesting the company doesn't have a great deal of faith that it can make either one as viable as it would like them to be.\n\nBoth spinoffs have been canceled in the meantime, though, with the company saying it will instead invest time and resources to make both of them better profit centers. The indecision tacitly suggests that Alibaba isn't actually sure what it should do; it may be doing something it doesn't actually want to do.\n\nHowever, some important details are being overlooked amid all the corporate drama. That is, China's economy is seemingly on the mend. The country's consumer prices grew for a third straight month in April, while producer prices fell again, suggesting consumer demand is perking up.\n\nUnderscoring this argument is March's 3.1% year-over-year growth in China's retail sales on top of the hefty 10.6% retail-spending surge in March of last year. This progress is being made against the backdrop of the nation's first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.3%, accelerating from Q4's growth pace of 5.2%, making China one of the few countries to see its economy pick up steam during the three-month stretch.\n\nAlibaba stock plunged this week anyway after its first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations. Just keep things in perspective. Last quarter's top line was still up 7% year over year. That's respectable for a company amid multiple overhauls. The stock's stumble is a buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nDutch Bros\n\nWhen you think of coffee houses, you most likely think of coffee titan Starbucks. And rightfully so. There are nearly 39,000 Starbucks locales peppered across the planet, with roughly 16,600 of these stores found within the United States. It's tough not to come across one when you're out and about.\n\nAn up-and-coming coffee rival called Dutch Bros(NYSE: BROS), however, should have Starbucks' management looking over its shoulders.\n\nDutch Bros is a distinctly different concept. Whereas the posh and polished feel of the typical Starbucks location was highly marketable during the early 2000s and then again in the 2000-teens, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a shift that was already underway even before the contagion took hold. That is, increasingly more consumers are now less interested in form and formality and are more interested in functional, casual experiences.\n\nThat's Dutch Bros, to be sure. It only operates coffee and beverage drive-thrus, and anyone who's visited one readily recognizes that each stand has its own personality reflecting the individual people working there. As the company says of itself, \"We may sell coffee, but we're in the relationship business.\"\n\nThe thing is, the numbers and data suggest this is precisely what America's consumers increasingly want. Last quarter's top line was up 39% year over year, largely thanks to the 45 new stores opened during its fiscal first quarter ending in March. This only brings the store count up to 876 locations, far fewer than Starbucks' footprint. However, for Dutch Bros, the company's long-term target of 4,000 drive-thrus is certainly an achievable goal. The stock should reflect this growth as it's achieved.\n\nDraftKings\n\nLast but not least, add DraftKings(NASDAQ: DKNG) to your list of unstoppable stocks that are better buys than Amazon at this time. Simply put, DraftKings is a sports-betting stock. In states where it's legal to do so, its app and website allow consumers to place various wagers on a wide range of sporting events.\n\nIt's not a brand-new business but is a relatively young and immature industry. The U.S. Supreme Court lifted the federal sports-betting ban in just 2018. Any such wagering before then was illegal, except in a handful of states. Even then, it was highly restricted. Although it's no longer federally prohibited, not every state permits it yet, and the ones that do aren't necessarily on board with mobile or internet-based sports betting.\n\nThe legalization movement is gaining traction, though. That's why Goldman Sachs believes the country's current yearly sports-betting handle (the total amount of money people wager) of around $10 billion could eventually swell to $45 billion. Market researcher Imarc further fleshes out the industry's prospective future by suggesting it will grow at an annualized pace of more than 12% through 2032.\n\nDraftKings is already clearly showing it's capable of capitalizing on this opportunity, too. Last year's top line was up 66% year over year, nearly halving the company's operating loss. Analysts are calling for comparable growth all the way through 2027, with a swing to a profit in the cards as soon as next year.\n\nSee, not only do more legalization and more adoption obviously help, but DraftKings also becomes more fiscally efficient the longer it operates within a state and retains a customer. An acquired bettor tends to become profitable between the second and third year they're a DraftKings user.\n\nGiven that much of its customer base has not yet been around that long -- but soon will be -- don't be surprised to see profit growth dramatically outpace revenue growth from here. This, of course, creates a tailwind for the stock, which has been performing quite well of late anyway. The lull since March makes for an attractive entry point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in DraftKings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in DraftKings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DraftKings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires",
        "content": "All eyes have been on tech companies since a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) kicked off last year.\n\nBig Tech companies like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have rallied investors, with the stock up 69% in the last 12 months. The retail giant has gained support by delivering solid growth in its e-commerce segment and investing heavily in the budding AI market. Amazon is on a promising growth path that might see it flourish over the long term.\n\nHowever, it could be worth investing in a company that is at an earlier stage in its AI venture (with potentially more room to run) and has a history of outperforming Amazon's stock. AAPL Chart\n\nAmazon has made many millionaires over the years, with its share price nearly doubling since 2019. However, the chart above shows Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has climbed almost three times higher than Amazon's in the same period.\n\nApple has taken a slower approach to AI than Amazon since the start of 2023, but recent developments suggest Apple is gearing up to make a big splash in the sector this year.\n\nSo, forget Amazon. Apple has made far more millionaires and will continue to make more.\n\nAn edge over the AI consumer market\n\nApple has achieved almost unrivaled brand loyalty with its customers over the years. Consumer preference for its products was best conveyed by Warren Buffett last year when he said, \"If someone offered you $10,000 to never buy an iPhone again, you wouldn't take it.\" While surprising, the sentiment rings true for millions of consumers who would sooner give up many other brands before straying from Apple.\n\nThe company has strategically created an interconnected ecosystem for its devices that discourages users from switching to rival products. Advanced connectivity and Apple-exclusive apps like Messages and FaceTime have become integral to many people's workflows, keeping them within the company's ecosystem even when it comes time to upgrade.\n\nApple has achieved leading market shares in many of its product categories, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. Meanwhile, the wide use of its products allowed the company to quickly expand in digital products, with its services segment becoming its second-highest earning division (only after the iPhone).\n\nServices quarterly revenue has risen 36% over the last three years, significantly outpacing the iPhone's growth of 16%.\n\nIt's no secret that Amazon similarly has a vast user base, with its retail site available in about 20 countries. Meanwhile, it's home to the world's biggest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), where it is rapidly expanding its AI offerings to businesses. However, Apple could arguably fare better in the consumer space of AI over the long term by leveraging the popularity of its products.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone maker's devices could become a major growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, proven by the success Apple has already had touting its digital services. On May 7, Apple held its \"Let Loose\" event, where it debuted its newest iPad Pro. The tablet is the first device to be equipped with Apple's M4 chip, its most powerful chip yet.\n\nThe M4 significantly expands Apple's AI capabilities and is a promising look into the company's future in AI. Apple will hold its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where it is expected to build on its recent event by unveiling a range of new AI-powered features. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported in April that the company plans to overhaul its Mac lineup to focus on AI offerings.\n\nApple is a far better value than Amazon\n\nAmazon has won over many investors this year. However, while its rally has benefited current investors, it has also raised the price of entry for new ones. Meanwhile, recent hurdles have kept Apple's stock at a more attractive price point. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart shows Apple has a significantly lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow ratio. These are helpful metrics when determining a stock's value as they take into account the company's financial position. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. And Apple wins on both fronts.\n\nMoreover, Apple's free cash flow of $101 billion is far higher than Amazon's $46 billion, suggesting Apple could be better equipped to invest in its business and overcome potential headwinds.\n\nAlongside immense brand loyalty and an expanding position in AI, Apple's stock is a no-brainer that could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $578,143!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials?",
        "content": "Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up by 9.0% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Amazon.com's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n\n17% = US$38b ÷ US$217b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.17 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nAmazon.com's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE\n\nTo start with, Amazon.com's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 17%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 9.4% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 14% in the same period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AMZN? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Amazon.com Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Amazon.com's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Walmart’s WMT beat-and-raise quarterly release should ordinarily provide favorable read-throughs for Target TGT, which is scheduled to report results before the market’s open on Wednesday, May 22nd. But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target.\n\nTo start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart’s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company’s service offerings hard to resist. The company’s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year.\n\nAnother major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options.\n\nWalmart’s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target’s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line\n\nTarget is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues. The stock was up big following each of the last two quarterly releases in March and November, as can be seen in the one-year performance chart below relative to Walmart and the Zacks Retail sector. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +38.7% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 69.6% beating EPS estimates and 56.5% beating revenue estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart beat both EPS and revenue estimates, but Home Depot missed on revenues. Aside from these two ‘conventional’ retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1.\n\nIn fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.\n\nWith respect to earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 467 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 17th. We have almost 150 companies reporting results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. This week, the most keenly awaited earnings release isn’t from Target but rather from Nvidia NVDA, which reports after the market’s close on Wednesday, May 22nd. Lowe’s, TJX Cos, Macy’s, and Ralph Lauren are some of the other companies reporting this week.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 467 index members are up +4.6% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues, with 77.7% beating EPS estimates and 60.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe have been flagging an acceleration in the earnings growth trend, which becomes more clear once the Bristol Myers drag is removed from the data; the pharma giant came out with a huge one-time charge. The chart below shows the Q1 earnings growth pace for these companies on an ex-BMY basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings growth for these companies would have been +7.5% instead of +4.6% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag. The chart below puts the Q1 ex-Energy earnings growth pace in the context of other recent quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been weaker for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.9% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nThe chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2024 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy and sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -0.7% while the growth pace improves to +9.2% on an ex-Energy basis.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9% on +4.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe revisions trend has been very favorable for Q2 estimates, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is the Q2 revisions trend on an ex-Energy basis Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.6% revenue growth.

Wall Street has been impressed with the pharma company’s ability to innovate and effectively bring new products to market.\n\nMeanwhile, its gross margin also saw an impressive rise from 78.4% in the first quarter of 2023 to 82.5% in the first quarter of this year. Eli Lilly benefited from higher prices and an improved product mix, underscoring the company’s operational efficiency and pricing power. Operating income in the same period grew by 63%, and earnings per share increased by 59%. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $42.4 billion and $43.6 billion. The company also anticipates further margin expansion.\n\nAs a result, LLY stock has advanced 30% year-to-date (YTD), hovering slightly below all-time highs. Yet, the shares are expensive, trading at 56 times forward earnings and 19 times sales. Nonetheless, Wall Street is expecting further gains from the pharma stock, as the 12-month average price stands at $877.50, presenting an upside potential of 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet (FN) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on our list of stocks to buy is Fabrinet (NYSE:FN). Its equipment enables the transmission of massive data volumes at high speeds. With data demand constantly rising and a wide range of services ranging from optical packaging to precision manufacturing, Fabrinet deserves your attention as a long-term investment.\n\nAnalysts point out that Fabrinet has demonstrated robust financial health with a market cap of $8.4 billion. In early May, management released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Exceeding guidance, quarterly revenue was $731.5 million, compared to $665.3 million for the same period 12 months ago. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $2.39, compared to $1.94 for the year-ago quarter.\n\nWall Street was pleased about the growth in optical communications revenues, particularly from datacom revenue, which grew 150% YOY. Management is optimistic about its position in the high data rate datacom market. Fabrinet’s operating and net profit margins currently stand at 9.6 and 9.9%, respectively. In other words, management has successfully navigated the competitive manufacturing landscape to maintain profitability.\n\nSince the start of the year, FN stock has returned 22%, rallying significantly after announcing better-than-expected financial results. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 26.2 times forward earnings and 3.1 times sales. Given the extent of the recent rally in Fabrinet shares, potential investors may consider waiting for a pullback towards the $220 level. Fabrinet will likely continue its growth trajectory in future quarters, making it a compelling stock to buy within the tech manufacturing sector.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) Blocks that spell out ETF in front of jar with money and change.\n\nSource: SHUN_J / Shutterstock\n\nLarge-cap growth stocks typically thrive in rapidly expanding industries like technology and biotech. Known for high growth rates and valuations, these companies are expected to outpace other established stocks. Such growth shares may offer a blend of stability and significant long-term potential, making them an important part of many portfolios.\n\nTherefore, the Vanguard Growth ETF is next on our list of stocks to buy (NYSEARCA:VUG). This fund allows investors to replicate the performance of leading large-cap U.S. growth stocks. Launched in January 2004, the ETF offers broad exposure to about 200 companies.\n\nOver half of VUG’s holdings are in technology stocks (56%), followed by consumer discretionary (19%), industrials (9%) and healthcare (8%) sectors. The top 10 holdings collectively account for over half of the fund’s net assets of $226 billion. Among the top names are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Visa (NYSE:V) and others.\n\nSince January, with a gain of over 11%, VUG has outperformed many individual stocks and the benchmark indices. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 10%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 5%. Currently, the VUG fund trades at 38 times trailing earnings and 10 times book value. With a competitive expense ratio of 0.04% and a modest 0.5% dividend yield, VUG remains an appealing option for investors seeking exposure to large-cap growth stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "5 Stocks Powering the Dow ETF Year to Date",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average touched the milestone of 40,000 for the first time on strong corporate earnings and renewed bets for rate cuts. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 6.4% so far this year. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising this year, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are American Express Company AXP, Walmart Inc. WMT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS and Merck & Co. Inc. MRK.\r\n\r\nThe blue-chip index has outperformed in recent months, with the broadening out of the stock market rally beyond the tech sector. Cyclical stocks, banks and small-cap stocks have all shown an upward trend in recent weeks, powering the blue-chip index. Bouts of stronger earnings and stronger guidance from many mega-cap stocks also propelled the index (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024).\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is also paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\r\n\r\nInflation in the United States cooled down for the first time in six months, sparking new bets on Fed rate cuts as soon as September. Low rates are favorable for stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, around 70% of traders now expect at least one cut by the September meeting, a notable increase from a week ago.\n\nDIA in Focus\n\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $33.3 billion and an average daily volume of 3.7 million shares. It tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket, with each making up for less than 8.6% share. Financials (23.2%), information technology (18.8%), healthcare (18.5%), consumer discretionary (14.7%) and industrials (13.9%) are the top five sectors (read: ETFs to Make the Most of the Sector Rotation).\r\n\r\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks of DIA\n\nAmerican Express is a diversified financial services company offering charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services worldwide. Shares of AXP have risen 28.8% so far this year. American Express earnings are expected to grow 15% this year. It makes up for 3.97% share in DIA portfolio. It has a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nWalmart has evolved from being just a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer into an omnichannel player. It is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units worldwide. The stock has risen 21.8% this year. Walmart has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It has jumped nearly 21% this year and accounts for 3% in the fund’s basket. AMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and accounts for 3% of DIA portfolio. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. The stock has gained more than 20% so far this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 60.5% for this year. Goldman accounts for a 7.6% share in DIA’s portfolio and has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nMerck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. It has gained more than 20% so far this year and accounts for 2.1% in the fund’s basket. Merck is expected to see earnings growth of 474.2% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Walmart Is Firing On All Cylinders And That Includes Its Newer Businesses That Go Beyond Groceries",
        "content": "Walmart Is Firing On All Cylinders And That Includes Its Newer Businesses That Go Beyond Groceries\n\nOn Thursday, Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) surpassed estimates with fiscal first quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The discounter significantly expanded its e-commerce sales and boosted profits with newer businesses, including advertising and its efforts to appeal to more affluent shoppers in order to fight off rivals like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). While Walmart is the nation’s biggest retailer, Amazon leads when it comes to e-commerce, but Walmart is determined to stop being the underdog in this rare arena as well as to grow outside groceries.\n\nFiscal First Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 30th, the big box retailer reported that sales grew 6% YoY to $161.51 billion, surpassing $159.50 billion that LSEG estimated. Net income also grew from last year's comparable quarter as it amounted to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share.\n\nExcluding fuel, Walmart’s same-store sales in the U.S. grew 3.8%. Also excluding fuel, Sam’s Club same-store sales grew 4.4%.\n\nBoosted by its growing third-party marketplace, as well as rise of both store pickup and delivery of online orders, e-commerce sales impressively rose 22% YoY in the U.S. However, despite more visits, both physical ones to its stores and online to its website, consumers spent roughly the same compared to last year’s quarter as average ticket remained flat, but transactions rose 3.8%.\n\nBut, Walmart’s newer businesses kicked in with third of YoY increase in operating income coming from that segment.\n\nGlobal advertising grew 24% and 26% in the U.S. alone. Like Amazon, Walmart expanded its online footprint by welcoming sellers onto its platform and offering them advertisement and fulfillment services. Its U.S., marketplace sellers rose 36%, while the total count in Mexico went up almost 80%.\n\nWalmart's grocery business has been fueled by the widening gap between fast-food and restaurant pricing versus the lower cost of home cooking. Also, for the first time, its delivery business surpassed its store pickup in terms of volume, showing that shoppers appreciate the convenience that Walmart offers, as they are coming more frequently than they have before, along with newer customers.Outlook\n\nWalmart is now expecting to hit the high end or slightly top its previous full-year guidance. It previously guided for net sales growth between 3% and 4% with adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart is doing better than others. The nation’s largest retailer and private employer is often considered as an indicator of the state of the U.S. economy. However, it is doing way better than the U.S. economy during such inflationary periods as it sells essentials like groceries that made about 60% of sales in its most recent fiscal year and when it comes to staples, its value-oriented reputation precedes the big-box retailer. But, in order to fight off rivals like Amazon, Walmart is also expanding its target demographics with its efforts to appeal to younger and high-income shoppers and these new businesses both lifted its profits during the quarter and also fueled the growth of its operating margin that surpasses its sales growth. Earlier this week, Walmart announced layoffs, along with news of reallocating hundreds of employees, but CFO John David Rainey emphasized that this move is not about cost cuts but about shifting away from remote work as the company’s corporate culture is about being together. By the looks of it, Walmart management knows what it's doing.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDifferent than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\n\nAMZN boasts a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Its bottom-line is projected to rise 56.6% year-over-year for 2024, while Wall Street anticipates its top line to improve by 11%.\n\n12 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.48 to $4.54 per share. AMZN also boasts an average earnings surprise of 48.2%.\n\nOn a historic basis, Amazon has generated cash flow growth of 25.3%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 59.4% this year.\n\nInvestors should take the time to consider AMZN for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Rank rating, notable growth metrics, and impressive Growth and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +56.6%. This estimate has changed +14.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMZN _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $638.26 billion and $709.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon.

        "title": "Private Equity Prowl: 3 Overlooked Stocks Primed for Buyout Bids",
        "content": "Though buyouts, mergers, and acquisitions struggled over the past few years in light of higher interest rates, that trend may soon reverse. Consulting and accounting firm PwCpoints to three factors driving an imminent rise in buyout action: improved economic conditions, plenty of dry powder sitting on the sidelines, and a “pressing strategic need for many companies to adapt and transform business models” that often inspires buyout deals. This has led to some overlooked stocks that you should consider.\n\nFinding buyout stocks to buy is tricky, though, since the most profitable candidates for retail investors often tend to be objectively terrible stocks. Threading the needle between stocks decent enough to hold while waiting for a buyout while still offering sufficient gains to make the waiting worthwhile isn’t easy. These three buyout stocks to buy buck that trend, though, with decent (enough) operational and financial outlooks that nevertheless remain primed for a buyout.\n\nArcellx (ACLX) a representation of floating molecules\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nArcellx (NASDAQ:ACLX) a biotech stock focusing on cancer and autoimmune diseases, already has strong potential among buyout stocks to buy based on its longstanding partnership with its larger cousin Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD). The companies are working in tandem to develop pioneering CAR-T therapeutics. Unlike traditional cancer treatments that often involve surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation—methods with severe side effects and inconsistent results—CAR-T therapies revolutionize the approach by using the patient’s own immune system. This method “trains” immune cells to recognize and kill cancer cells, offering clear advantages over conventional treatments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe innovation associated with CAR-T therapies comes at a high cost. Fortunately for Arcellx, Gilead is shouldering much of the financial burden. Gilead supports Arcellx with an $85 million cash payment and a $200 million stock purchase plan, providing Arcellx with sufficient funds to operate through 2027 as they continue their mission to revolutionize cancer treatment. But, with as much cash as Gilead is throwing at Arcellx, it may only be a matter of time before the larger pharma stock absorbs Arcellx in its entirety. Do yourself a favor and invest in this and the rest of these overlooked stocks.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust because Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) deal didn’t pan out, doesn’t mean that iRobot should top your list of buyout stocks to buy. Shares are down more than 70% since January, but for buyout stock seekers, the game isn’t yet over.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s interest in iRobot wasn’t primarily about vacuum sales but about acquiring top-tier tech intellectual property. That IP portfolio remains valuable, positioning iRobot to gain significantly from its patents—either through standard operations or an alternative buyout route.\n\nEven if another buyout isn’t in the cards, iRobot’s operational outlook is promising despite concerns about share pricing. The company’s first-quarter report showed a massive earnings improvement at $0.30 per share, reducing net negative $2.95 per share loss in the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s 2024 outlook is solid, with management projecting a conservative revenue range of $825 to $865 million. Currently, iRobot trades at just 0.35x sales, so even if the company meets its low-end target, shares could quickly rebound into double-digit territory. This is one of the top overlooked stocks on the market.\n\nApplied Digital (APLD) futuristic image of a hand with the words block chain floating above it. representing riot blockchain stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSmall-cap stock Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) finds itself swimming in a much larger competitive pool, vast and pricy data centers, setting itself up as a buyout stock to buy as larger companies realize the value in owning and maintaining remote data storage and management sites.\n\nApplied Digital builds, owns, and manages data centers throughout North America and offers its services to a range of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing functions. The infrastructure is key to much of today’s digital economy, ultimately making the company’s $450 million market cap appealing to those interested in integrating data centers directly into their value chain.\n\nIts buyout potential is buoyed by the fact that massive capital expenditures and upfront building costs aren’t offset by current revenue, and the company remains perennially unprofitable. While management reduced net losses and bumped sales over the last few quarters, it remains a prime target for a buyout opportunity today.

        "title": "Time for Cloud ETFs on Earnings Strength &amp; Promising Growth?",
        "content": "Cloud computing has been at the forefront of the growth in technology for the past few years, offering efficient solutions for businesses and consumers. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow from $626.4 billion in 2023 to $1.27 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.1%, per MarketsandMarkets.\n\nThe widespread adoption of remote work and e-commerce has continued to fuel the need for scalable and reliable cloud solutions. Moreover, advancements in cloud technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and cybersecurity enhancements, have expanded the use cases for cloud services, attracting a broader customer base.\n\nThe global cloud computing market is led by three mega cloud service providers — Microsoft, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. The total cloud infrastructure market was worth $76 billion worldwide at the end of Q1 of 2024, which marked a year-over-year rise of 21%.\n\nAccording to recent data from Synergy Research Group cited on CRN, AWS, Microsoft and Google collectively managed a 67% share of the $76 billion global cloud infrastructure services market in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN recently reported their quarterly financial cloud numbers for the first quarter of 2024. Each company logged record quarterly cloud sales thanks to double-digit growth rates.\n\nInside Mega Cloud’s Size in Q1\n\nCombined, these three cloud leaders generated more than $61 billion in total sales in the first quarter of 2024. Their cloud units, in fact, boosted total revenue growth as clients are increasingly adopting AI services. Growth rates are rebounding from the relative lows seen through most of 2023.\n\nIndividually, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $26.7 billion in total sales (up 21% year over year) during the quarter, meaning Microsoft’s cloud group now has a run rate of $107 billion.\n\nAWS generated just over $25 billion in revenues (up 17% year over year). This means Amazon’s cloud business now has an annual run rate of $100 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud reported total sales of $9.6 billion (up 28% year over year). This shows that Alphabet’s cloud business currently has an annual run rate of $38.4 billion.\n\nIn terms of global market share, AWS is leading (with a 31% share), followed by Microsoft (25%) and Google (11%). Other cloud market-share leaders of the first quarter included Alibaba BABA at 4% market share and Salesforce CRM at 3% cloud share.\n\nOther Companies’ Soaring Cloud Demand\n\nAlibaba’s revenues from Cloud Intelligence Group grew 3% year over yeardespite slashing prices in the first quarter. Like Alibaba, Baidu BIDU also came up with upbeat results thanks to the boom in AI Cloud revenue. Baidu’s AI Cloud Group revenues grew by 12% year over year, driven by generative AI and foundation models, which Baidu looks to strengthen further.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Growth in 2024\n\nAccording to Gartner Forecasts, global end-user spending on public cloud services is forecast will grow 20.4% to $678.8 billion in 2024, up from $563.6 billion in 2023. All segments of the cloud market are expected to see growth in 2024. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is forecast to experience the highest end-user spending growth in 2024 at 26.6%, followed by platform-as-a-service (PaaS) at 21.5%.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nWisdomtree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD, Global X Cloud Computing ETF CLOU, Amplify Global Cloud Technology ETF IVES, Fidelity Cloud Computing ETF FCLD and Cloud Computing ETF First Trust SKYY are some of the ETFs that can be played on the boom. All these ETFs have gained in the range of 4% to 5% in the past week.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Being dynamic in stock market investing is crucial, especially given the recent vibrancy of online platforms. Platforms such as Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD), among others, wield significant influence over stock market trends. With more than 11.9 million on its platform, it has the power to create unique opportunities and risks for its growing user base. Hence, investors must keep tabs on the most undervalued Robinhood stocks, potentially offering robust long-term gains.\n\nThe Robinhood Investor Index tracks the performance of the top 100 most trending investments on the Robinhood platform. It factors in customers of all pocket sizes to effectively ensure equal representation. To no one’s surprise, its user base is mostly invested in tech and consumer durables. Moreover, 80% of those investments are in large caps, so you will likely see many of the usual suspects on their top 10 list. That said, three of the most undervalued Robinhood stocks are part of its top 10, offering tremendous upside ahead.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logistics center in Szczecin, Poland.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is arguably one of the more low-key members of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks. Though it doesn’t attract the same media buzz as other “Mag 7” stocks, it packs the biggest punch. Its recent quarterlies have been stunning, outpacing top-and-bottom-line results in the past five consecutive quarters. Moreover, with 29 upward EPS revisions for the upcoming quarter, there are still plenty of surprises in store.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon released another smashing earnings report late last month, crushing top-and-bottom-line estimates across both lines with considerable aplomb. Revenues were up 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143.3 billion, while its EPS of 98 cents beat estimates by a comfortable 15 cents. Amazon’s cloud computing segment in AWS was the star of the show again, growing at a quicker pace than the overall business at 17%. Additionally, results from domestic e-commerce and digital advertising were also impressive.\n\nThe integration of generative AI with AWS has been a boon for Amazon, and with a ramp-up in capital expenditures, cloud-based AI demand will continue soaring for the foreseeable future. Despite its stellar run-up last year, AMZN stock still offers an 18% upside from current price levels based on consensus analyst estimates.\n\nFord Motor (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) is one of the oldest in the automotive sector, poised for a roaring comeback later this year. Like its peers, it operates in a highly unconducive business environment. On top of that, it had to contend with the testy United Auto Workers (UAW) strike last year, adding to its woes.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsequently, it lagged major indices last year, but we’ve seen an excellent turnaround in the past six months. For perspective, F stock is up 21.4% in the past six months, compared to the S&P 500’s 17% gain.\n\nHowever, despite those encouraging gains, F stock still trades under 0.30 times, 68% lower than the sector median. On a forward cash flow basis, the stock trades 60% behind the sector median. Additionally, Wall Street analysts assign a ‘moderate buy’ rating to the stock, offering at least a 22% upside from current prices. Hence, it provides a more attractive alternative to many pricey EV stocks. Its hybrid strategy has paid many dividends in the current economic climate, while its domestic EV sales continue to impress on-and-all.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nFresh off a proxy battle win against billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger has much to prove to its investors. Peltz criticized Iger’s lackluster financial management, unreasonably high executive compensation, and Disney’s stock market slump. These arguments have a lot of truth, as shown by the company’s operational struggles in recent years.\n\nFollowing the win, though, we’re seeing Iger adopt a more aggressive stance in turning things around for Disney. Particularly in its efforts to revitalize its entertainment division, Iger announced the firm will limit its output to no more than three Marvel films and up to two Disney+ shows per year.\n\nMoreover, Iger will emphasize profitability for Disney’s streaming division. The segment turned a profit in the first-quarter (Q1), and the company expects full-streaming profitability by the end of the year. Additionally, the company has joined hands with Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) to effectively unlock new bundling opportunities. Few would dispute that combining Disney+, Hulu, and Max creates a compelling entertainment package.\n\nDisney attracts a commanding ‘strong buy’ rating from Wall-Street, a 27% upside from current prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

These expansions provide a steady income stream and the chance to offer further services while highlighting the loyalty and confidence of important clients.\n\nAdditionally, Radcom has demonstrated its focus on innovation and adaptation to market developments, notably the transition towards cloud-based solutions. Especially, through its collaboration with Rakuten Mobile and the integration of Radcom ACE with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services.\n\nFurther, in Q1 2024, Radcom’s $85.3 million cash, free of debt, represented an all-time high. This shows sound financial standing and leaves room for growth. Lastly, strong business fundamentals and a favorable outlook are reflected in the company’s confidence in delivering a fifth consecutive year of sales growth, boosting profitability, and raising revenue projections for 2024.\n\nCirrus Logic (CRUS) The Cirrus Logic (CRUS) logo on a phone in someone's jeans pocket.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nCirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) demonstrated disciplined execution against sales headwinds, leading to a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP EPS. This improvement in operational edge is based on increased supply chain efficiencies and decreased operating costs. Moreover, by repurchasing shares, the company returned $186 million in cash to its stockholders in the 2024 fiscal year. Programs for repurchasing shares can raise values and demonstrate the company’s confidence in its finances and prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, at the end of fiscal 2024, Cirrus Logic had around $700 million in cash. This demonstrates the strength of its balance sheet. Furthermore, the corporation had $300 million in undrawn revolvers and no outstanding debt. These financial measures show consistency and offer room for expansion and future investment plans. The non-GAAP free cash flow margin increased to around 21% for the 12 months ending Q4 fiscal 2024, indicating improvements in the company’s cash flow management. Hence, this enhancement highlights successful operating procedures and economical capital utilization.\n\nFinally, for Q1 2025, the business forecasts revenue from $290 million to $350 million. This is against decreased smartphone units and seasonal weakness in general market goods sales.\n\nSanmina (SANM) a computer chip. Chip Stocks to Buy Now\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSanmina (NASDAQ:SANM) has a substantial top-line diversity, leading across several end markets, including industrial, medical, defense, aerospace, automotive, communication networks and cloud infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, no customer contributed more than 10% of sales during Q2 2024, suggesting a well-diversified clientele. Due to its diverse income sources from several sectors, Sanmina is less vulnerable to the dangers of focusing on just one market area. Further, the lack of a significant revenue-generating consumer guarantees that Sanmina’s financial performance is not unduly dependent on any one individual.\n\nMoreover, the company held $651 million in cash during Q2 2024. Inventory turnover came in at 4.8%, up slightly from the previous quarter. And inventory is $1.38 billion, down slightly from the previous week. This results in a non-GAAP pretax return on invested capital of 22%, much higher than the weighted average capital cost.\n\nFinally, a low leverage ratio of 0.57 times shows a robust balance sheet. High inventory turnover and excellent inventory management indicate good working capital management. Overall, this enables Sanmina to allocate capital optimally and keep levels of liquidity in check. Keep your eye on SANM, for it is definitely among breakout stocks you will want to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "TV companies flaunt ad tech and AI to persuade advertisers to spend",
        "content": "By Dawn Chmielewski\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Television \"upfront\" advertiser presentations this week in New York City were hardly about TV at all.\n\nThe annual week-long affair where media executives have traditionally pre-sold TV advertising featured many familiar trappings: pop stars Alicia Keys and Billie Eilish dazzled packed auditoriums with live performances; celebrities Kevin Hart, Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Reynolds hawked their latest projects, and Super Bowl star Tom Brady joined other pro athletes on stage.\n\nBut it was ad tech and artificial intelligence that was getting all the attention.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery talked up shoppable ads on its Max streaming service. Google's YouTube introduced a new AI-powered format to place non-skippable ads on videos streamed to internet-connected TVs. Netflix advertising chief Amy Reinhard said the streamer would develop its own in-house ad technology that would give advertisers new ways to buy and gain new insights.\n\nAd tech even featured in punchlines.\n\n\"You're probably wondering why I am so giddy today,\" joked late-night host Jimmy Kimmel at Walt Disney's presentation. \"It's because Disney is using proprietary meta-tagging data that leverages video intelligence to tap into the moods and emotions within the content we create. That's why I'm so proud of what we've done here.\"\n\nStreaming players also sought to win over advertisers from traditional media rivals by emphasizing their increasing reach.\n\nNetflix's Reinhard said the company's ad-supported plan now has 40 million global monthly users, up from 5 million a year ago. In countries where Netflix offers a version of its service with advertising, it accounts for 40% of all sign-ups, she said.\n\nChief Content Officer Bela Bajaria touted the chart-topping popularity of shows like its period drama \"Bridgerton\" and the streaming service's expanded investment in big, live events, including a splashy deal to stream two NFL professional football games on Christmas Day.\n\nAt Amazon.com, the online superstore and cloud computing giant's biggest news was its appearance at the event. To make a memorable first impression with ad buyers at its first upfront since introducing ads on Prime Video earlier this year, the company treated some 2,500 guests to a bounty of breakfast foods that reminded some of the big-shrimp buffets of television's heyday.\n\nDisplays arrayed around Pier 36 in Manhattan showcased the breadth of Prime Video's streaming content, including one that rained dollar bills from the ceiling to promote a forthcoming reality competition from YouTube personality Mr. Beast that offers a $5 million prize.\n\nStory continues\n\nMike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, called Amazon a \"one-stop destination\" for entertainment and said it delivers ads to more than 200 million global customers, 115 million of whom live in the U.S.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger returned to the upfront stage for the first time since 1994, back when \"television used to be something you watched on television.\"\n\nWhile much has changed over the last three decades, he said, \"what hasn't changed is the fact that success in this industry is predicated on one thing: telling great stories.\"\n\nA day later Iger, speaking at MoffettNathanson's 2024 Media, Internet and Communications Conference in New York, told investors he had cut investment in programming for traditional television dramatically as part of Disney's strategy to maximize audiences and profit in streaming.\n\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in New York, additonal reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; editing by Kenneth Li and Rosalba O'Brien)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Apple AAPL.\n\nAmazon Sets New Highs: Time to Buy the E-Commerce Giant?\n\nIt’s been a long road back to new highs for many tech companies. While several of the Magnificent 7 stocks already eclipsed their former highs, one recently broke out in conjunction with the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nOne of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Amazon maintains a strong position in the online retail marketplace, backed by its Prime membership with ultrafast delivery services. The company has diversified into a host of other categories and is now the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering.\n\nAn expanding global presence and growing capabilities in areas such as generative AI, health care, grocery, and autonomous driving are major tailwinds for Amazon moving forward.\n\nThe Zacks Rundown\n\nAmazon, currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefitting from underlying momentum in both retail and technology sectors. Shares are displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.\n\nThe company is part of the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry group, which currently ranks in the top 36% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This group is widely outperforming the market over the past year.\n\nHistorical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nIt’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.\n\nRecent Earnings Results and Future Estimates\n\nAmazon's financial prowess is undeniable, with its first-quarter results propelled by Prime and AWS. Earlier in May, the tech behemoth delivered adjusted Q1 earnings of $1.13/share, a 264% jump from the year-ago period. The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.1%.\n\nNet revenues of $143.31 billion during the quarter rose 13% year-over-year. Growing momentum in AWS, expanding investments in generative AI, as well as strength in its advertising business contributed to the upbeat results.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 48.2%, topping estimates in each of those instances. For the current quarter (Q2), analysts have increased EPS estimates by 10.87% in the past 60 days. The Q2 Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $1.02/share, reflecting a nearly 62% improvement year-over-year. Revenues are projected to climb 10.6% to $148.59 billion.\n\nAMZN stock has responded favorably, breaking out to new all-time highs. Shares have advanced more than 22% already this year.\n\nWill Amazon Soon Initiate a Dividend?\n\nA titan in the tech world, Amazon is standing as the solitary giant among its peers, steadfastly declining to distribute dividends to its shareholders. However, amidst a landscape where its contemporaries are succumbing to shareholder pressure, whispers abound of an imminent shift in Amazon's dividend policy.\n\nIn a flurry of shareholder-friendly moves, tech behemoths have succumbed to the allure of dividends. Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and Google-parent Alphabet spearheaded this trend, amplifying investor returns through quarterly dividends and reinforced stock buyback programs.\n\nApple's recent announcement of a dividend increase alongside a monumental share repurchase program further underscores this shift. These initiatives serve as a potent sweetener for investors, especially amidst the backdrop of capital-intensive AI endeavors and signs of growth deceleration in certain business segments.\n\nAmidst this shareholder fervor, Amazon thus far stands as an enigma, resisting the temptation to join the dividend fray. But its resilience is not without merit. Bolstered by its thriving enterprise cloud operation, the company continues to scale unprecedented heights. AWS remains a pivotal revenue driver and is poised to breach the $100 billion revenue mark this year, buoyed by surging demand for generative AI services and cloud migration trends.\n\nDespite news of former AWS CEO Adam Selipsky stepping down recently, the segment remains in good hands with long-time insider Matt Garman taking on the role.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSupported by a robust suite of services, relentless innovation, and a burgeoning global footprint, Amazon remains poised for sustained growth and market dominance.\n\nNew highs for AMZN shares are a sign of strength. The stock’s performance is backed by a positive revisions trend in terms of earnings estimates.\n\nMake sure to keep an eye on Amazon as the tech juggernaut looks primed to continue its outperformance.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Netflix's NFL deal highlights streamer's 'natural evolution' as sports rights take center stage",
        "content": "Netflix's (NFLX) surprise three-season deal with the NFL marks a major shift for the streaming giant, which has historically avoided traditional live sports investments.\n\nAs part of the deal, the platform will stream two Christmas Day games: the Pittsburgh Steelers taking on the Kansas City Chiefs, followed by a matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans.\n\nSome on Wall Street view the move as more of an experiment for Netflix, with streaming platforms pressured to expand their offerings, especially amid the recent introduction of advertising tiers.\n\n\"I think this is much more about testing the waters, learning how to do advertising inside of sports,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet told Yahoo Finance, arguing the NFL won't necessarily help the streamer retain subscribers over the long term.\n\n\"Down the road, [Netflix will] presumably bid on more sports rights and do more advertising,\" he surmised. \"I think it's a good thing. It's just a natural evolution of the business.\"\n\nThe deal comes as the NFL has been adding more streaming services as media partners. The list also includes Amazon's Prime Video (AMZN) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA). And Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in note to clients he believes the games will help offer a boost to Netflix's ad tier and enable the company to \"actively promote\" its own content during the games.\n\nNetflix — which will reportedly pay less than $150 million per game, according to Bloomberg — will also bring large global distribution to the NFL, according to Anmuth.\n\n\"Last year’s 3 NFL Christmas Day games ranked among the top 25 most viewed TV programs in 2023. With the partnership spanning 3 years, we believe NFLX could deepen its relationship with the NFL, especially as the league looks to further diversify its distribution strategy & we would expect more live sports over time,\" he wrote.\n\nJefferies agreed, writing in a research note following the news, \"We are positive on the NFL deal, which we believe will create a compelling value proposition for NFLX's emerging ad business.\"\n\n\"This would represent NFLX's biggest foray into fully unscripted live sports content,\" the bank said, calling the deal terms \"highly attractive\" given that the company has previously spent similar amounts on original movies such as \"The Gray Man and \"Red Notice.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n'Live sports is a game changer'\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for media giants as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable or streaming service fee to access sports over other types of content.\n\n\"This foray by Netflix into live sports is a game changer for the company,\" Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. \"The immediacy of live events is what makes it such a draw for audiences. ... Many people are already going over the top and cutting the cord and watching all kinds of content on streaming. Sports is the natural next step in that evolution.\"\n\nNetflix had previously maintained that it wanted to focus on \"sports entertainment\" instead of paying for the rights to live sports, which can be expensive for media companies.\n\nIn the past, the company has released docuseries and sports-adjacent content like \"The Quarterback,\" \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive,\" \"Full Swing,\" and \"Break Point,\" in addition to live sporting events like the \"Netflix Cup\" celebrity golf tournament, which aired late last year.\n\nOne recently announced partnership seemed to deviate from that status quo. In January, Netflix announced a 10-year deal with TKO Group Holding's WWE (TKO) that will bring WWE’s flagship program Raw, a live wrestling production, to the streaming service beginning in 2025.\n\nIt also announced a live-streaming boxing event in July between YouTuber Jake Paul and heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.

        "title": "Walmart is nabbing Target’s ‘Tar-jay’ rep and Amazon’s delivery crowd as even the wealthy flock to the retail giant",
        "content": "Walmart makes the big-box retail business look easy. The Arkansas-based retailer long known as a discount store has not only retained its budget-hunting customer, but it’s now also going after the wealthier crowd of competitors Target and Amazon.\n\nThe company reported 6% revenue growth to $161.5 billion and a comparable sales growth of 3.8% in its first quarter Thursday, which it said was driven by upper-income shoppers. Walmart was so optimistic it raised its outlook for growth to 4% from 3% for the year and expects adjusted earnings to be $2.37 per share, up from $2.23.\n\n“We are seeing customers trade into Walmart,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told Bloomberg on Thursday. “We’ve historically been thought of for value, but now it’s value, quality and convenience.”\n\nWalmart attributed its growth to its 21% surge in e-commerce revenue, led by curbside pick-up and delivery orders—a service typically favored by wealthier consumers looking for convenience. It also gained market share in groceries as consumers continue to stray from discretionary purchases in favor of just buying the essentials.\n\nCustomers making over $100,000 have contributed the most to Walmart’s market share takeover, according to analyst Neil Saunders of GlobalData, and the retailer’s strategies of late reflect its desire to keep that the case. In April, Walmart announced the release of the premium own-brand food line bettergoods, with a focus on bright packaging and plant-based items to appeal to Gen Z and bougie shoppers. Earlier this year the retailer remodeled and revamped 800 locations, stocking wider shelves with $50 silk sleep masks and $230 duck breast. The company plans to remodel 900 stores in 2024, CEO Doug McMillon said in the company’s earnings presentation.\n\nThese tactics are on top of its consistent discount efforts, which McMillon said have been key to Walmart continuing to resonate with its consumer base—particularly as consumer sentiment reaches a six-month low despite cooling inflation—and have kept analysts upbeat on the company.\n\n“Despite a volatile consumer spending backdrop, increased concerns on the health of the low-end consumer, and the relative resiliency of shares of [Walmart], we approach its [first quarter] print with optimism,” Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai wrote.\n\nClawing at retail’s top dog\n\nWhile Walmart has moved to appeal to higher-income consumers, historically higher-income-focused Target has gone in the opposite direction as the company lags in sales. Regarded for its cheap-chic, Tar-jay reputation, the Minnesota retailer has pivoted to lower-income customers, launching in February its “dealworthy” budget brands with most items under $10. It’s not an all-in endeavor for Target: The company also launched its own paid membership, Target Circle 360, mirroring Amazon Prime and Walmart+ efforts to tap into well-to-do customers looking for convenience.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has made similar moves to compete with Walmart’s e-commerce rally, introducing last month an unlimited grocery delivery service under $10 for Amazon Prime members, with the same service available for EBT cardholders without Prime for $4.99. Last July, Walmart rolled out Walmart+ Assist and cut the price of its paid membership in half for those receiving government assistance. Walmart’s grocery delivery services eclipsed Amazon’s since 2019, with Insider Intelligence predicting recently that Walmart orders will make up 26.9% of online grocery sales by the end of 2024, with Amazon making up 18.5%. While the big-box retailer has expanded to 4.4 billion units delivered in the past 12 months, Amazon Prime reported last month it delivered 4 billion items for same or next-day delivery in the U.S. in 2023.\n\nOther factors are keeping Walmart on top: The company grew its advertising business 24%, a venture with higher margins than retail. It laid off hundreds of its corporate staff earlier this week, relocating many remote employees to its Arkansas headquarters, a decision that came on the heels of its move to shutter all 51 of its health care clinics. Walmart decreased U.S. inventory 4.2% as an additional cost-cutting measure.  But Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen, told Bloomberg in March that Walmart’s real advantage lies in its potential to tap into customers across tax brackets.\n\n“This is about modernizing the brand and making it seem chic and cool,” Chen said. “Walmart is good at basics and wants to be known for more than that — and sell more than that.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Brace for a Market Crash With These 3 (Surprising) New Inflation Hedges",
        "content": "An inflation hedge protects against currency devaluation caused by rising prices. It involves investing in assets expected to maintain or increase value. Hedging can prevent investment losses due to inflation, which reduces the real return.\n\nFor instance, the real return is negative if a stock yields 5%, but inflation is 6%. Inflation-hedged assets may retain high value despite lower intrinsic worth as investors seek them out.\n\nWhen people talk about their money not stretching as far, they’re referring to inflation affecting their earnings or wealth. Inflation reduces purchasing power, so individuals aim for earnings and investments to outpace it, allowing them to afford more, even with rising prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach state has its own inflation rate, influenced by its economy and fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation can affect specific areas like gas or food costs and comes in three types: demand-pull, cost-push and built-in inflation.\n\nThat said, here are three new inflation hedges that people are going crazy about.\n\nNvidia Is the New Gold\n\nOne of the most traditional inflation hedges is gold. It has been a top inflation hedge since 1971; during the Great Recession, gold became so popular despite its volatility and short-term uncertainties. Banks believe that having more gold is better, and thus, they bought more of it in 2022 than in 1967.\n\nEven in 2024, inflation is still an ongoing concern, and it has been causing delays in Fed rate cuts. As per Bloomberg, investors are turning to big tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. However, gold remains the preferred inflation hedge.\n\nIn the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents viewed significant U.S. tech stocks as a hedge against inflation alongside gold. At the same time, 46% favored gold and nearly a third chose tech giants.\n\nSurvey respondents favored tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as the best hedge against inflation, highlighting their dominant role in the U.S. markets. Their steady profits and growth instill investor confidence in continued gains. Though reduced from 2022 highs, inflation still concerns investors, with 59% citing it as the top market risk. The following CPI reading is anticipated to sit at 3.4% year-over-year.\n\nThree years ago, inflation skyrocketed past 2%, and Nvidia surged six times. Other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also outperformed the S&P 500 market by 50%. Although, like other tech stocks, they can be sensitive to inflation and changes in inflation rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia marked a milestone and surged over 200%. The stock has exceeded $900 per share. In February, it awed the market through its excellent earnings report. The company showed $22 billion in revenue through generative AI and H100 GPUs. It also helped Nvidia get a seat at the trillion-dollar market cap hierarchy.\n\nInvesting in Farmlands\n\nInstitutional investors historically used agricultural land as an inflation hedge, but it must often be made available to most investors. In 2023, pension funds and tax-exempt vehicles held about 1,331 U.S. farmland properties worth $16.2 billion. Retail investors can access farmland assets through publicly traded REITs like Farmland Partners (NYSE:FPI) and Gladstone Land (NASDAQ:LAND).\n\nFarmland historically performs well during high inflation due to its positive correlation and real asset nature. It correlates more strongly with the CPI and Producer Price Index than other investments. Real assets, including farmland, typically outperform traditional assets during inflation, with nominal value growth. Farmland has seen year-over-year price decreases only once since 1987, indicating value preservation despite inflation.\n\nFarmland scarcity serves as a natural inflation hedge. The United States lost over 11 million acres in 20 years, and could still lead to more acres by 2050. Farmland proved otherwise, as it averaged an 11% annual return from years 1992 through 2020. It appreciates while generating operating cash flow, supported by the constant demand for food.\n\nFarmland is a unique real estate investment that provides stable income and resilience across economic cycles. Moreover, the returns from farmland are not correlated with public markets. That makes them unaffected during economic shifts.\n\nAlthough investing in farmland can be crucial due to decreasing arable land and global population, it is still worth an investment. In fact, regenerative agricultural practices make farmlands look enticing for investors.\n\nPut Up a Chicken Wings Business\n\nChicken is reclaiming its place as a favorite food choice for Americans. With beef prices increasing, people are opting for more chicken wings at fast-food restaurants and frozen tenders at grocery stores. Meat companies like Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and Pilgrim’s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) are seeing increased profits from poultry due to rising demand and lower costs for livestock feed.\n\nRetail sales of all U.S. chicken products rose by 3% for the year ending April 21, while pork and beef sales slightly declined. With food spending at a three-decade high, consumers opt for cheaper private-label items and cut back on branded purchases. Tyson executives noted shoppers prioritizing essentials over beef and expensive brands, but the duration of this trend remains to be determined.\n\nMoreover, unstable U.S. cattle supply leads meatpackers like Tyson to pay more for livestock, raising wholesale and retail meat prices. Tyson executives noted ranchers still need to begin rebuilding herds. Ground beef retail prices surged approximately 12% in March compared to a year ago, with Tyson’s CEO attributing strong chicken demand to more discerning consumers.\n\nFabio Sandri, CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride, noted a shift to cheaper chicken items on restaurant menus. Despite overall restaurant foot traffic declines, Pilgrim’s fast-food chain sales rose 6% in the latest quarter. Shares in the second-largest chicken processor surged approximately 60% over the past year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInflation decreases purchasing power, limiting what one can buy with the same money. That may lead to borrowing or reduced spending on non-essential items. If one’s income keeps up with inflation, there’s less for investments or discretionary spending.\n\nAdditionally, inflation may trigger a recession by reducing consumer spending and prompting interest rate hikes to curb inflation, slowing borrowing and business activity.\n\nCommon inflation hedges include gold, commodities, a balanced 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, REITs, rental income, the S&P 500 and TIPS. Or, you may also want to invest more in Nvidia, farmlands or perhaps put up a chicken wing business while it’s cheap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Quantum Computing Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "Quantum computing has the potential to usher in a new era of computing power. While the market is still digesting the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they have yet to focus in on the next big discovery.\n\nRemarkably, quantum computers have the ability to perform optimization and predictive tasks faster than conventional computers. They do require a load of capital to build and maintain. So only a select few public companies in the market specialize in this field.\n\nAs U.S. equities remain rather volatile, it’s probably best to stay away from small-cap pure-play quantum computing stock. Why? Their ability to generate profits for shareholders is still up in the air. So, let’s examine larger tech companies that have made significant strides in developing quantum computers. And the icing on the cake is, Wall Street is optimistic about all of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for software giant and household name, Google. Having already written about Alphabet stock in the past, I’m still bullish on the company’s share price. It trades at a 21.9x forward earnings, which is lower than competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But the tech giant has many tailwinds guiding its rise, including advanced computing technologies.\n\nIn fact, Google has been developing quantum computing technology for well over a decade now. Sycamore is the name of Google’s quantum computer gem. This quantum system has 70 qubits, which is higher than a prior version of the computer. Similar to normal bytes, qubits can be in a state of 0 or 1. However, they can be in these states simultaneously, endowing them with more processing power than a normal computer.\n\nAccording to Koyfin, Google has 59 Wall Street analysts covering its shares, and 48 of them have given the stock a strong buy or buy rating.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nImpressively, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have soared well over 200% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe reason? The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The chipmaker is the key provider of advanced chips that power large-language models for training AI chatbots. Nvidia’s state-of-the-art Blackwell chips will develop improved AI models for both businesses and consumers. In addition to its lead in AI processing power, Nvidia is paving the way for quantum computers.\n\nFurther, Nvidia has developed an open-source platform dubbed CUDA-Q. It allows quantum computing scientists to program and integrate quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical computing systems like GPUs and CPUs. The influence of Nvidia’s quantum computing platform goes beyond quantum computing systems in the U.S. In fact, national research centers in Germany, Japan and Poland are relying upon Nvidia’s open-source programming system to create their own quantum computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, as AI takes the forefront of the NVDA stock discussion, investors should also consider the chipmaker’s foray into quantum computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is another legacy tech business that has dipped more than one toe in the quantum computing space.\n\nIBM has been pursuing quantum computing research since the early 2000s. And the company’s desire to stay at the forefront of research in the field has not abated. Last year, IBM seemed to have extended its lead in quantum computing processors. The release of the Condor system took the market by storm. This quantum processor has 1,121 superconducting qubits, rendering it the largest quantum computing chip that has been developed.\n\nHowever, not all the news is positive. IBM has suffered with sluggish growth over the past few years. The uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment certainly has not helped. Nevertheless, quantum computing could prove to be an important growth lever for the business. IBM trades at 17.0x forward earnings and has received a couple of strong buy ratings from Wall Street firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) certainly fits the bill due to its wide range of products. It’s become the most recognizable e-commerce website, offering 1 to 2-day shipping for millions of items.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile Amazon established its beginnings with its online marketplace, the company has expanded into numerous industries. Twitch attracts gamers, Whole Foods attracts grocery shoppers and the company’s streaming segment brings in people who want video content.\n\nThose opportunities are compelling, but few of them offer the same opportunities as Amazon Web Services. Many businesses use this technology for data storage and productivity. It’s one of the many underlying businesses within Amazon’s corporate umbrella that should outlast its investors.

Businesses will always use advertising to get in front of potential customers. While some companies can use organic marketing strategies, advertising is still a popular way to reach people.\n\nThe company offers unmatched advertising channels via Google and YouTube. Profitable businesses can scale their advertising campaigns, generating more value for Alphabet’s shareholders. Companies that want to use organic marketing strategies will still have to study Google and how it ranks content.\n\nAdvertisers flock to Alphabet’s advertising channels because it does a great job attracting visitors. People will still search for information online and watch YouTube videos for many decades — if not centuries. Alphabet has the makings of a company that can survive for well over 100 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst quarter results further highlighted Alphabet’s growth.

You don’t get benefits like unlimited 2% cashback if you pay with physical cash. You need a credit card to get those rewards and American Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the leading credit card companies.\n\nThe firm is attracting more Millennials and Gen Z consumers. Over 60% of its new cardholders from Q1 2024 were in those groups. The quarter was a resounding success as revenue increased by 11% YoY. Net income soared by 34% YoY, pushing the company’s net profit margins higher.\n\nAmerican Express intends to generate annualized 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens beyond 2026. That long-term growth plan bodes well for a stock with only a 20 P/E ratio.

        "title": "Amazon Climbs Above 2021 Highs: Time to Buy the E-Commerce Giant?",
        "content": "It’s been a long road back to new highs for many tech companies. While several of the Magnificent 7 stocks already eclipsed their former highs, one recently broke out in conjunction with the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nOne of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Amazon maintains a strong position in the online retail marketplace, backed by its Prime membership with ultrafast delivery services. The company has diversified into a host of other categories and is now the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering.\n\nAn expanding global presence and growing capabilities in areas such as generative AI, health care, grocery, and autonomous driving are major tailwinds for Amazon moving forward.\n\nThe Zacks Rundown\n\nAmazon AMZN, currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is benefitting from underlying momentum in both retail and technology sectors. Shares are displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.\n\nThe company is part of the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry group, which currently ranks in the top 36% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This group is widely outperforming the market over the past year: Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHistorical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAlso note the favorable characteristics for this industry below: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.\n\nRecent Earnings Results and Future Estimates\n\nAmazon's financial prowess is undeniable, with its first-quarter results propelled by Prime and AWS. Earlier in May, the tech behemoth delivered adjusted Q1 earnings of $1.13/share, a 264% jump from the year-ago period. The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.1%.\n\nNet revenues of $143.31 billion during the quarter rose 13% year-over-year. Growing momentum in AWS, expanding investments in generative AI, as well as strength in its advertising business contributed to the upbeat results.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 48.2%, topping estimates in each of those instances. For the current quarter (Q2), analysts have increased EPS estimates by 10.87% in the past 60 days. The Q2 Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $1.02/share, reflecting a nearly 62% improvement year-over-year. Revenues are projected to climb 10.6% to $148.59 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMZN stock has responded favorably, breaking out to new all-time highs. Shares have advanced more than 22% already this year. StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nWill Amazon Soon Initiate a Dividend?\n\nA titan in the tech world, Amazon is standing as the solitary giant among its peers, steadfastly declining to distribute dividends to its shareholders. However, amidst a landscape where its contemporaries are succumbing to shareholder pressure, whispers abound of an imminent shift in Amazon's dividend policy.\n\nIn a flurry of shareholder-friendly moves, tech behemoths have succumbed to the allure of dividends. Facebook-parent Meta Platforms META and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL spearheaded this trend, amplifying investor returns through quarterly dividends and reinforced stock buyback programs.\n\nApple's AAPL recent announcement of a dividend increase alongside a monumental share repurchase program further underscores this shift. These initiatives serve as a potent sweetener for investors, especially amidst the backdrop of capital-intensive AI endeavors and signs of growth deceleration in certain business segments.\n\nAmidst this shareholder fervor, Amazon thus far stands as an enigma, resisting the temptation to join the dividend fray. But its resilience is not without merit. Bolstered by its thriving enterprise cloud operation, the company continues to scale unprecedented heights. AWS remains a pivotal revenue driver and is poised to breach the $100 billion revenue mark this year, buoyed by surging demand for generative AI services and cloud migration trends.\n\nDespite news of former AWS CEO Adam Selipsky stepping down recently, the segment remains in good hands with long-time insider Matt Garman taking on the role.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSupported by a robust suite of services, relentless innovation, and a burgeoning global footprint, Amazon remains poised for sustained growth and market dominance.\n\nNew highs for AMZN shares are a sign of strength. The stock’s performance is backed by a positive revisions trend in terms of earnings estimates.\n\nMake sure to keep an eye on Amazon as the tech juggernaut looks primed to continue its outperformance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The future of the U.S. economy appears promising, marked by significant investments and rapid industrial growth. President Biden’s policies are revitalizing American manufacturing, particularly in green industries and microchip production, aiming to bring these crucial sectors back from China. While there are concerns about rising debt and inflation, the positive indicators, such as record-low unemployment and substantial investment in advanced technologies, paint a hopeful picture for sustained growth. Despite challenges, the U.S. economy’s transformation is poised to bolster domestic industries, offering a blueprint for economic revitalization.\n\nKnowing that the economy will continue to be very strong, investing in the stock market makes a lot of sense. The only question is which stocks will deliver the best returns. Read more to find out why experts say these three stocks are top picks to buy.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT), the Swedish giant music streaming service, has been a household name for years. For the past year, however, the company has translated its brand recognition into profits, as seen by its $300 SPOT stock price, with over 25 analysts recommending it as a strong buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSPOT capitalized on the success of the music streaming industry in recent years, which is projected to bring in $29.6 billion in 2024. Expected to rise to $33.97 billion by 2027, the industry has a three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% with solid revenue expectations. Spotify is expected to be the primary beneficiary as it is the market leader with a 31.7% share.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Spotify reported financial growth across the board. Starting with revenue, Spotify announced it generated $3.64 billion in sales or a 19.53% increase year over year. Additional successes were noted in net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $197 million and 97 cents, respectively, equating to increases of over 180% year over year. Spotify outperformed industry estimates in the past quarter.\n\nPart of the success achieved in Q1 was outlined through acquiring and maintaining its user base. Though Spotify already has the most extensive customer base in the industry, lifting free users to paid memberships has been a critical detail in Spotify’s plans. In previous quarters, Spotify consistently increased both its user base and premium subscription membership. Current users stand at 236 million, up 31 million in the past year alone. Constant growth, while also captivating users, has allowed Spotify to achieve consistent success in operations in the past year. This will continue through 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord Motor (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) is an American multinational vehicle manufacturer based in Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford formed and founded the company on Jun. 16, 1903. The company sells cars and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand.\n\nIn Q4, Ford achieved robust sales growth, with total vehicle sales reaching almost 2 million, a 7.1% increase from the previous year. Strong performance in trucks, electric and hybrid vehicles underscored Ford’s market leadership, as shown by its stock price rising by 6.67% year-to-date (YTD) and trailing gross profits of $15 million.\n\nFord’s February 2024 report unveils an 81% surge in all-electric vehicle (EV) sales, with 6,368 units sold. This shift underscores a strategic move towards electrification, as EVs now constitute 3.8% of Ford’s total volume. Despite challenges like production adjustments, Ford’s momentum is sustained, especially with the success of models like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning paving the way for future growth and infrastructure collaborations.\n\nFord is one of the top picks, ready to ride the EV boom in the coming years. 23 analysts give this stock a buy rating.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an online retailer focusing on B2C (business-to-consumer) sales. In addition to the retail side, AMZN operates Amazon Web Services, or AWS. It also produces the Kindle, consumer-centric technology under the “Fire” brand, and Ring. It also has Amazon Prime, a subscription-based service that leads to a stable source of revenue. Its stock is currently priced around $185, with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. AMZN stock is up 24.77% YTD as of the market close on May 14.\n\nAMZN saw steady revenue growth last year, with year-over-year (YOY) quarterly growth of 12.5%. However, coming off a lackluster fiscal year in 2022, YOY quarterly earnings growth is much more impressive at 228.8%. It has a profit margin of 6.38%, with a relatively high operating margin of 10.68%. Additionally, nine analysts have suggested an average price target of $226.66, representing growth of 21.16%.\n\nFuture growth and leadership changes make AMZN a stock to watch, but it remains a great buy — this is evident from the fact that over 60 analysts have made it a strong buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 29, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.97 a share.\n\nDKS has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.06%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.97 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.96.\n\nDKS is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Amazon (AMZN) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nAmazon, which is readying to report earnings on August 1, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.03 a share, and AMZN is 77 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nAmazon's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.31% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02.\n\nDKS and AMZN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Meet the Only 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Over the Last 3 Months",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" companies caught the market by storm in 2023 for their market-crushing gains. But the group has showed signs of cooling off.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that are outperforming the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) over the last three months.\n\nHere's why each of the three is doing well, whether these stocks are buys, and how to approach investing in the Magnificent Seven right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nLike any stock that has run up fast, Nvidia is one that investors have mixed feelings about. Some might think it is a bubble waiting to pop, while others believe it is on the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence (AI). But so far, the story has been led by fundamentals, which suggests that Nvidia could keep running higher.\n\nSustained rapid growth can justify even the most sky-high valuations. Especially if a company can double earnings in a single year. That's exactly what analysts are expecting from Nvidia, with consensus estimates on 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $24.87, and $31.54 for 2026.\n\nFor context, the company made $11.93 in fiscal 2024 EPS and reported its full-year fiscal 2024 earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nThe jump from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 looks promising, but there is concern that growth could cool in fiscal 2026. Still, if Nvidia notches $31.30 in fiscal 2026 EPS, that would give the stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 29 based on the current price.\n\nThat's a compelling valuation for a high-growth market leader in the early innings of the AI evolution. But it's also based on figures we won't see for nearly two years.\n\nWe'll get a better idea of how Nvidia is progressing toward these targets when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on May 22. As long as the growth is there, the stock could continue being a market winner. But if the narrative changes, even due to temporary factors, the stock could take a major hit.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nIn late February, Alphabet was the only Magnificent Seven stock with a cheaper valuation than the S&P 500. But that didn't last long.\n\nIt has been one of the hottest tech stocks as of late and went from out of favor to making a new all-time high. NVDA Chart\n\nAlphabet achieved phenomenal results in its recent quarter and announced its first dividend in company history. But it's not like the results were relatively better than peers like Meta Platforms.\n\nRather, the stock was being held back due to AI-related blunders and a view that it didn't have the innovation of a peer like Meta Platforms that has done a masterful job of monetizing AI to improve product performance and its bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is still looking to bring something new to the AI table. The recent run-up has more to do with strength from its legacy businesses like Google Search, Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android and a reminder that Alphabet is a cash cow with a ton of dry powder to reinvest in the business, make acquisitions, buy back stock -- and now, pay a dividend.\n\nAlphabet had some catching up to do, and it looks to be fairly priced now. For the next leg higher, I think the company has to show more innovation, but there are some levers it can pull in the meantime to provide value to shareholders.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon was one of the hardest-hit stocks in 2022, sinking to multiyear lows. Shares were so cheap that there were arguments that Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone was worth at least as much as the whole market cap of the company, which fell below $1 trillion in 2022 and is hovering around $2 trillion today.\n\nBeing way oversold helped propel a monster comeback in 2023. But AWS didn't even have a good year in 2023. Now, AWS has turned around, and the rest of the business is doing well, too. Just about everything is going right at Amazon, including cloud computing and domestic and international e-commerce.\n\nThe issue is that the stock still isn't cheap, and probably won't be anytime soon. Consensus analyst estimates call for 2024 EPS of $4.54, and $5.76 for 2025 -- giving Amazon a huge 32.5 P/E ratio based on 2025 earnings.\n\nSome investors might prefer to value the company based on price-to-sales (P/S) instead of P/E since it spends so much money reinvesting in the business and books far lower earnings than it could if it were more conservative. For 2024, analyst consensus sales estimates are $638.2 billion, and $708.7 billion for 2025, which would give Amazon a P/S ratio of 2.75 based on 2025 figures. From that perspective, Amazon is more reasonably priced. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe glass-half-full outlook would say that it deserves a higher P/S today than in the past because each dollar of sales is of higher quality. To an extent, that's true because AWS is making up a larger share of the company's revenue, and AWS is a high-margin cash cow that drives the profitability of the broader business.\n\nFor context, AWS generated $9.4 billion in operating income in the first quarter of 2024 on $25 billion in sales, compared to $5.1 billion from $21.4 billion in sales a year earlier. AWS still only made up about 17.5% of total Amazon sales in the recent quarter. But it was a much smaller share of the business just five years ago, whereas today, it can help move the top line and dominate the bottom line.\n\nThere's certainly a buy case to be made for Amazon, even after its recent run-up. But it doesn't have Nvidia's growth, and yet it is still an expensive stock, even based on estimates over a year into the future.\n\nBuying a top stock for the right reasons\n\nIt's important to understand that sentiment and context can have just as much impact on a stock's short-term performance -- if not more -- than the fundamentals.\n\nAs a long-term investor, it can be helpful to know what is driving a stock's price to determine if it is a good value or if a lot of the expected growth is already priced in.\n\nThe story is out on Nvidia. The projections are so lofty that the company has to put up unbelievable results just to look like a good value. But so far, it has lived up to the hype.\n\nAlphabet is an excellent example of a company that made no significant changes but saw its stock price shoot up once investors were reminded that the strength of its core business outshines any AI snags.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon had sold off far too much for such a high-quality business. The growth is excellent, but the valuation is a lot higher today.\n\nThere's a variety of reasons the other four Magnificent Seven are underperforming over the last three months. But as a generalization, I'd say that Microsoft and Meta Platforms have raised the bar so high (and both stocks have crushed the Nasdaq Composite over the last year and a half) that it's hard to blow expectations out of the water.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple and Tesla are facing slowing growth, a bad look relative to their better-performing megacap peers.\n\nExpectations are everything to investors. If Apple and Tesla return to growth, it would be easier for those stocks to impress. But the degree of uncertainty with that prospect is why both stocks are out of favor.\n\nBy comparison, Nvidia is a darling that is already expected to keep growing. And as we saw with Microsoft and Meta in their recent earnings, a company can keep growing at an impressive clip, but it still might not be enough to move the needle.\n\nThe simplest way to approach the Magnificent Seven is to go with the company or companies you think have the best chance of growing or blending growth and value over at least the next three to five years rather than jumping in and out of whatever is working in a matter of months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 7 Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "If you’re on the hunt for stocks to buy this month, look no further. We’re close to the end of first-quarter 2024 earnings season, with 92% of S&P 500 companies having reported results. While the overall earnings season has been strong, there are certain stocks that have emerged as favorites among Wall Street analysts. The consensus surrounding some companies and their stocks has strengthened following strong Q1 prints and bullish guidance.\n\nGoing forward, stocks that have been given top ratings and aspirational price targets on Wall Street can be expected to outperform the broader market, providing big gains to shareholders. As such, investors would be well-advised to pay attention to analyst ratings as they provide direction on the likely future moves of stocks. Here are Wall Street favorites: seven stocks with strong buy ratings for May 2024.\n\nStocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been in investor jail ever since the social media giant issued disappointing forward guidance as part of its Q1 earnings report. But analysts still love the stock. The 41 professionals covering the company rate META stock a strong buy and have a median price target on the shares of $522.49. That’s 11% higher than the current share price. Analysts agree that the Q1 print and outlook were both pretty good.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt best the guidance provided by Meta Platforms was conservative. And it shouldn’t take away from the fact that the company crushed its Q1 print. Meta reported EPS of $4.71 versus $4.32 that was expected among analysts. Earnings more than doubled from $2.20 per share a year earlier. Revenue in Q1 totaled $36.46 billion compared to $36.16 billion expected on Wall Street. Sales saw their fastest rate of expansion since 2021.\n\nWhile META stock is down about 10% since its Q1 print was delivered, the company’s share price has nearly doubled (up 97%) in the last 12 months.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is a company that reported truly disappointing Q1 numbers, sending its stock down 8% as a result. Yet analyst continue to rate UBER stock a strong buy. The median price target on shares of the ride hailing and delivery company is $89.21, implying 37% upside from current levels. Wall Street analysts continue to believe in the company and the growth opportunity before it.\n\nFor Q1, Uber reported a loss of 32 cents per share on revenue of $10.13 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of 22 cents a share and sales of $10.10 billion. The company blamed the poor results on losses related to the “revaluation of equity investments.” There were some bright spots in the print. Gross bookings increased 20% from the previous year, while revenue in the mobility segment increased 30% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nStory continues\n\nUber recently announced a new partnership with the grocery delivery app Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) that it says could benefit its delivery business going forward. Despite the recent dip, UBER stock has gained 71% in the past 12 months.\n\nStocks to Buy: Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nWalt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) is back in the good graces of analysts as it controls costs and profitably grows its streaming service. A total of 24 analysts have a consensus strong buy rating on DIS stock with a median price target of $133.55, which is 27% higher than where the shares are currently changing hands. Disney’s recent Q1 print showed that the Mouse House is continuing to reduce losses at its streaming services.\n\nDisney said that its operating income rose 17% as its Disney+ and Hulu streaming services turned a profit in the quarter for the first time. When combined with ESPN+, the streaming business lost $18 million during the quarter. But that was much better than a loss of $659 million a year earlier. Disney+ subscribers grew by more than six million in the quarter to 117.6 million global customers.\n\nWhile still well below its all-time highs, DIS stock has gained 16% so far this year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is rated a strong buy among 33 analysts who track the company’s progress. Analysts continue to like the opportunity AMD has in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) microchips, and have a median price target on the company’s shares of $192.40, which is 26% higher than where the stock is trading now. With its recent Q1 earnings, AMD ratcheted up its forecast for AI microchip sales this year.\n\nThe company now expects to sell $4 billion worth of AI chips in 2024, up from a previous estimate of $3.5 billion forecast in January of this year. AMD said revenue at its Data Center unit grew 80% YOY to $2.3 billion due to robust sales of its latest MI300 series AI chips. The company said it has sold more than $1 billion of the AI chips since they launched about six months ago.\n\nOn their earnings call, management said that the company is working on new AI chips and successors to the current generation of processors. AMD stock is up 10% so far in 2024.\n\nStocks to Buy: GE Aerospace (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) is a fairly new company after a massive reorganization and divestment. However, analysts like what they see so far from the industrial conglomerate. Sixteen analysts rate GE stock a strong buy with a median price target of $179.13. The price target implies 12% growth over the next year. Most of the price targets have come after GE Aerospace, which specializes in aircraft engines, reported a Q1 profit that beat estimates and raised its forward guidance.\n\nGE Aerospace reported EPS of 82 cents, which beat consensus estimates of 65 cents. Revenue in Q1 totaled $15.2 billion, which was slightly below Wall Street estimates of $15.3 billion. However, GE raised its forward guidance and announced that it is increasing its quarterly dividend payment by a whopping 250%. This after General Electric hived off both its energy and healthcare businesses into separate public companies.\n\nGE stock has increased 60% on the year.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a top pick among analysts. A total of 41 Wall Street professionals give the stock a consensus strong buy rating with a median price target of $220.00 per share. The price target is 18% higher than current levels. Analysts praise Amazon for its cost controls as well as the growth we’re seeing in online advertising and cloud computing.\n\nWith its Q1 financial results, Amazon noted that Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit, now accounts for 62% of the company’s total operating profit. Advertising sales surged 24% during the quarter from a year earlier. The ad business grew faster in Q1 than either retail sales or cloud computing, and is an important profit driver for Amazon.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts and media, Amazon executives said that demand for generative AI should bolster the company’s cloud computing business going forward. AMZN stock is up 25% year-to-date.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCryptocurrency miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has a strong buy rating and a median price target of $18.72, which is nearly double (91% higher) then where shares are at currently. Despite a downturn in crypto prices, analysts seem to like the outlook for Riot Platforms, especially as the latest Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event is now behind us and as a raft of new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity.\n\nIn the lead up to the halving event, which is when the supply of Bitcoin is cut by 50%, RIOT stock fell as much as 40%. The stock has recovered some in recent weeks but is still down 36% on the year. Analysts expect a big recovery in Riot Platforms stock in coming months. There is also expected to be consolidation among crypto miners as the available supply of BTC dwindles, and Riot Platforms is seen as well-positioned to come out on top.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Extraordinary Stock Set to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "This year already saw two new companies' market caps surpass $2 trillion, and a third is poised to hit that milestone.\n\nThe current members of the $2 trillion club are some of the most well-respected names in their fields, and all of their businesses revolve around technology.\n\nMicrosoft ($3 trillion) established itself as an AI leader with a smart investment in OpenAI. Its Azure cloud computing platform and enterprise software business reap the benefits. Apple ($2.8 trillion) sells the iPhone and operates a growing services ecosystem built around its devices. Nvidia ($2.2 trillion) sits at the forefront of the AI trend as a supplier of the most sought-after chips for large language model training. Alphabet ($2.1 trillion) owns the most popular search engine, Google, operating a massive advertising business, and one of the biggest cloud computing platforms in the market.\n\nThe next company likely to join them also heavily invested in tech, including cloud computing and digital advertising. But its core business, retail, also shows a ton of potential for earnings growth. That company is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTrends driving Amazon to $2 trillion\n\nThree important pieces of Amazon's business are benefiting from various trends. But investors shouldn't discount the operational excellence that Amazon's management team exhibited to take advantage of those trends.\n\nAmazon is a key player in the booming AI trend. As demand for generative AI capabilities expands, cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) is building out its capabilities to meet that demand.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy says he likes to think of AI development in three layers. At the base layer, Amazon offers developers compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and its own custom Trainium 2 chips. It also offers a service, SageMaker, that makes training a large language model easier by managing customer training data. In the middle layer, it offers Amazon Bedrock for anyone looking to build on top of existing large language models. Developers can expand on existing models and build custom AI apps using Bedrock's tool set. At the top layer are existing AI-powered applications running on the cloud.\n\nAll three layers have contributed to the reacceleration of Amazon Web Services' revenue growth. The segment's revenue run rate surpassed $100 million in the first quarter.\n\nThe second trend is digital advertising. Despite how prevalent digital advertising is these days, it remains an opportunity for Amazon. The company saw great success with its sponsored product listings. In January, it started including video ads in Prime Video by default, adding another opportunity for sales growth. That said, management still says it thinks there are growth opportunities in its core display ad business.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts advertising revenue climbed 24% year over year last quarter, and exceeded $49 billion over the trailing 12 months.\n\nAmazon's original business, online retail, remains a big opportunity. Despite relatively slow growth for online store sales, third-party seller services, and subscription services (which mostly consists of Prime memberships), the real story is its expanding operating margin. North American operating margin climbed to 5.8% from 1.2% a year ago. That margin expansion was fueled by more efficient shipping operations as Amazon overhauled its logistics network. International operating income turned positive in the first quarter, a major milestone for the company.\n\nSmall improvements in operating margin go a long way when a business generates $500 billion per year in revenue.\n\nAmazon's path to a $2 trillion market cap\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon's market cap sits just shy of $2 trillion. The stock needs to gain just 3% for the company to reach that milestone, and that could happen any day. Given the significant trends lifting its business and its operational successes, it shouldn't take long for the market to push it over the top.\n\nThat's especially true considering that the stock trades at a fair valuation. Its enterprise-value-to-sales ratio is 3.2, and analysts on average expect 11% sales growth both this year and next year. But with the expanding operating margin, it should produce earnings and free cash flow growth that far exceeds its revenue growth. And its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of about 40 looks downright cheap compared to Amazon's historic levels.\n\nAt its current price, Amazon has an opportunity to surpass a $2 trillion valuation and never look back.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 20 Years: May 2024",
        "content": "They say the best time to invest was 20 years ago. And indeed, that’s not too long after the early 2000s recession bottomed out. You’d be sitting on 377% in gains if you invested in the overall market exactly 20 years back. But the second best time? Many would say the COVID trough, but I’d argue that it’s right now, if you know where to look.\n\nThe investing landscape right now may be better than many think, for those looking for buy-and-hold opportunities in the market. Things are surely more fast-paced these days, but 20 years gives you the chance to make the most out of what is likely to come in the future. You’d have known 20 years back that the internet was going to be very big. Accordingly, we have a lot of promising tech that can be big in the next two decades—but we’ll be investing in them indirectly through big ‘no-brainer’ stocks to buy and hold, instead of startups that could fizzle away.\n\nThus, without further ado, here are the seven stocks I’d put my money into if I were handed a crisp $10,000 bill (they actually exist – look it up)!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust when it seemed like Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) influence in the cloud sector couldn’t expand any further, the company surpassed expectations once again. Azure revenue soared 23% this past quarter to eclipse $35.1 billion. And it’s worth noting that arguably the entire AI revolution up until now has been indirectly orchestrated by Microsoft. OpenAI would not be where it is right now without the billions it got from Microsoft. From foundational infrastructure to cutting-edge large language models, Microsoft is clearly leading the way.\n\nThe data boom doesn’t seem to be cooling down either. Azure’s deals valued at more than $100 million increased by over 80%, while commitments over $10 million more than doubled year-over-year.\n\nIt’s estimated that 65% of Fortune 500 companies are now using Azure and/or OpenAI. Yes, MSFT stock trades at 35-times forward earnings and a tech selloff means this stock would likely decline as well. But this is a solid pick if you are holding for 20 years. I have full trust in CEO Satya Nadella, so this is definitely one of the best long-term stocks to buy and hold, in my opinion. MSFT price. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the backbone of the semiconductor industry. Most semiconductor companies supply directly from Taiwan Semi. Many analysts think the stock deserves to trade lower than its fabless peers due to the “China threat” and on-shoring trends. However, this argument does not make sense to me since any impact on Taiwan Semi would surely hit fabless semiconductor companies much harder. Plus, Taiwan Semi is investing $40 billion in U.S. chip manufacturing. Its facility is expected to be operational in 2027 or 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s financial metrics remain robust. Gross margins exceeded 53% while operating margins topped 42%. Revenue rose 16.5% year-over-year, beating estimates on both earnings and revenue. I see more upside ahead, since the premium you’re paying now is historically not that high. TSM PE. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile seasonal effects dampened smartphone demand slightly in the first quarter, TSMC has done well across all areas of its business. Advanced technological nodes remain in high demand, with 3nm and 5nm processors already accounting for a sizable 46% of wafer sales. Barring unexpected disruptions, this chip giant appears well-situated to sustain its major role in the industry. Notably, TSM stock also provides a 1.7% dividend yield. So, if you like income and you want semiconductor exposure, this is one of the top stocks to buy and hold.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nIt’s hard to ever be bearish on Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). This company has historically outperformed the S&P 500, and I think it is well-positioned to continue doing so. CEO Warren Buffett might be old right now and not have a right-hand man anymore. But even then, this company’s portfolio is very solid.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway partially acts like an ETF, but with massive flexibility. The company can pile cash or other assets into big private companies like BNSF Railway, taking on such investment over the years. Its biggest holding, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has not performed well compared to other Big Tech companies, but it hasn’t delivered terrible results either.\n\nI think once Apple gets its AI game on point, we should see even more bullishness spill over into Berkshire stock.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) An image showing the front of the Google Headquarters in California.\n\nSource: turtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) most recent quarterly results were very encouraging. Revenue increased 15.4% year-over-year, totaling over $80.5 billion. This continues to show the company’s leading position in internet search as well as video sharing through YouTube. Revenue is also up significantly in the company’s cloud computing business.

AI has not made a dent in Google’s search segment, and YouTube seems even stronger to me. You can make an alternative to Google, but you can’t replace the massive amount of content on YouTube.\n\nYouTube and cloud computing revenue combined are on track to exceed $100 billion annually by the end of the year, if current growth continues. Each of the company’s major business lines showed robust expansion. YouTube has restrictions on adblockers now which is helping power revenue higher. The company also beat both top and bottom-line estimates, a trend I expect to continue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) 2 Billionaires who Could Push Jeff Bezos Out of Top Spot\n\nSource: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently reported another stellar quarterly performance. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, comfortably surpassing Wall Street projections. But an even bigger highlight was its operating income, which rebounded 221% to $15.3 billion. It seems all of Amazon’s ongoing efforts to streamline operations and cut costs are paying off. I believe the stock can continue climbing if the stock’s premium holds up.

Plus, with $48.8 billion in free cash flow over the last twelve months, I see a lot more room for expansion. Amazon is much more than an e-commerce business after the cloud boom, so I have solid conviction in this diversified business for the next two decades.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive.

While their revenue came in just a smidge below estimates, I’d say the company’s performance was rock solid across some key areas that matter a lot more. The current pullback is likely due to investors taking profits instead of concerns about IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) core business.\n\nIBM has been turning the corner, and is now quickly shifting from a mature tech cash cow to a cloud + quantum computing and software play.

And since Hashi’s Terraform is the number one tool buildings use for their infrastructure codes, IBM’s getting a great way to help more businesses get started. I think the company’s recent move to link up with Red Hat makes a lot of sense too. Indeed, this deal makes IBM’s entire IT assistance collection stronger.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) CRISPR (CRSP) logo within a DNA sequence\n\nSource: Catalin Rusnac/ShutterStock.com\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is by far the riskiest play on this list. If you’ve been reading my articles for a long time, you’d know I stay away from most biotech companies.\n\nHowever, CRISPR has been one of the rare exceptions. I’ve been bullish on the stock since 2022. CRSP stock hasn’t made big moves either way since, but if this gene-editing tech does become successful, you’ll be laughing your way to the bank in 20 years.\n\nThe company currently has seven trials underway studying new treatments for cancer, autoimmune conditions, heart health issues, and diabetes. The company’s tech can solve a lot more problems than just these.\n\nThe big reason why I’m bullish on this stock is the company’s $2.1 billion cash buffer. I’m confident this cash can last for many years into the future. Analysts seem bullish on CRSP stock over the near-term, too.

        "content": "Billionaire activist investor Daniel Loeb describes the strategy at his Third Point hedge fund as “an event-driven and value approach.” He looks to unlock shareholder value through special situation investing, whether it is mergers and acquisitions, restructurings or other catalysts that can spur gains.\n\nLoeb started Third Point with just $3 million in 1995 and grew it into a hedge fund with $6.6 billion in assets under management. He is definitely not a wallflower.\n\nRather, Loeb is the epitome of an activist investor, taking positions in companies and letting management know when he disagrees with their strategies. He often does so quite publicly in shareholder letters that many times acerbically take management to task.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are his three biggest bets currently. Nearly $2.5 billion, or 37% of total AUM, are in these three stocks. Did Loeb err or is it an investing masterstroke?\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logistics center in Szczecin, Poland.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nThird Point owns 4.2 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock worth approximately $638 million. With an average buy price of around $118 per share, Loeb is sitting on gains of almost 58% at current prices.\n\nWall Street thinks there is still room to move higher as the consensus one-year price target is over $211 per share. At the high end, analysts see the e-commerce giant running up to as much as $245 per share. That would be more than double Loeb’s buy-in price. Amazon represents 9.7% of Third Point’s portfolio.\n\nWhile the hedge fund operator is an activist, Amazon isn’t one he is targeting. Rather, this could be the value side of his business that views AMZN stock as one to buy and hold forever.\n\nBecause of its dominance in e-commerce, the leadership it holds in cloud services and its ability to integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of its business to improve not only its own operations but those of its clients, Amazon is still a massive growth stock.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest position Loeb has in Third Point.\n\nHe owns just over 2 million shares valued at $758 million, or 11.5% of the hedge fund’s total. Microsoft currently trades at $412 per share, which is about 47% above Loeb’s average $282 per share buy price.\n\nThere is also more upside wiggle room in MFST stock, according to Wall Street. The one-year price target analysts assigned Microsoft is over $452 per share, implying 9% growth still possible.\n\nHowever, one analyst has a $600 per share price target, indicating an additional 46% gain to be had.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is another company that is taking a holistic view of AI and how it can benefit the organization. It was one of the first businesses to fully integrate the technology into all its platforms and products.\n\nWhere Amazon invested billions into AI startup Anthropic, Microsoft backed OpenAI, the company most closely associated with generative AI through its ChatGPT platform.\n\nMonetizing AI has been a challenge for Microsoft and other businesses in the field. That will ultimately be a consideration in how far and how fast the technology gets adopted.\n\nPG&E (PCG) Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit up\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest holding in Third Point is electric utility Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG), or PG&E. It may seem an odd choice for the hedge fund, particularly since Loeb owns 57.9 million shares worth over $1 billion but Loeb has owned shares for years.\n\nHis buy price on the stock is an average of around $9.70 per share, giving him an 85% gain.\n\nYet it is the value investor in him that saw potential in a restructuring. PG&E was crushed by the California wildfires in 2017 and 2018, including the Camp Fire that killed 85 people, destroyed 23,000 homes and businesses, and destroyed the town of Paradise.\n\nThe utility’s failure to maintain its equipment caused it. PG&E ultimately pled guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter and was fined 44 million. It declared bankruptcy in 2019.\n\nLoeb first bought PG&E bonds when they fell to distressed levels and subsequently became a shareholder in the company, building it into his largest position. He told investors the restructured company’s “fundamentals position it at the high end of the utility industry,” according to GuruFocus.\n\nLoeb counted on Pacific Gas & Electric finding its way out of the morass, which his returns to date suggest it has.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Look Irresistible Right Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) portfolio is rich with what the Oracle of Omaha would refer to as “wonderful” businesses. Though Berkshire’s portfolio has skewed away from technology stocks in prior decades, one can’t help but notice that the modern-day Berkshire portfolio has pivoted towards the modern age.\n\nAnd we’re not just talking about the conglomerate’s massive stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Aside from the iPhone maker, which still comprises a huge portion of the overall Berkshire portfolio, even after trimming by 13%, Berkshire owns a sprinkling (less than 1%) in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nApart from Berkshire’s tech-savvy bets, many other holdings within the Berkshire portfolio always stand to gain a lot by investing in technological initiatives. Most notably, AmericanExpress (NYSE:AXP) stands out as a firm that’s equipped to thrive in the data-driven age with its analytics capabilities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we’ll examine three Warren Buffett stocks that look irresistible as they embrace tech to boost long-term growth.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express is one of the older holdings within the Berkshire portfolio. Still, unlike other older Berkshire investments that have dragged their feet on the returns front of late, the premier credit card firm has continued to deliver impressive gains. Year-to-date, AXP stock is up more than 28%, thanks in part to some amazing quarters that shot past analyst expectations.\n\nConsumer sentiment could easily get choppier from here as inflation’s impact continues to weigh. That said, American Express looks poised to continue posting solid numbers, as its “spend-centric” model keeps flexing its muscles, even in the face of high inflation and macro headwinds that stand to impact global spending.\n\nWell-of Amex cardholders and spend-happy Millennials, some of whom were brought on just in the past year, do not look to be putting their cards away. As they continue buying a wide range of goods with their Gold and Platinum cards at 2024-era prices, AXP stock certainly stands out as one of the better inflation-fighting stocks in the market. Higher prices on just about everything translate into larger tabs on one’s monthly Amex bill.\n\nFurther, given its recent resilience and continued investments in digital transformation, AXP stock still seems a tad undervalued at less than 20 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a much smaller holding in the Berkshire portfolio at less than 1% at the time of writing. Indeed, Berkshire and Buffett seem to be fans of the credit card business, and it’s not a mystery as to why. Though V stock hasn’t been nearly as hot, up 7.3%, trailing the market by about 3%, I do view the leading credit card company as worth pursuing after its recent roadbump.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, Piper Sandler started V stock with an overweight rating. The company’s impressive network, which has high barriers to entry around it (a wide economic moat), and tech prowess were major reasons why Piper is a fan of the stock.\n\nMost notably, Piper outlined the potential for generative AI to help “drive upside to fundamentals.” Undoubtedly, Visa is as much a financial technology company as it is a creditcard firm. And you can bet it’s taking generative AI seriously as it seeks to gain any operating or growth edge it can get.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have the number-one holding in Berkshire’s public stock portfolio. Investors and Buffett followers have plenty of reasons to buy the stock, even if Berkshire is inclined to continue trimming in the near future.\n\nThe rest of 2024 could see Apple’s most aggressive push into generative AI yet, with the WWDC24 to begin on June 10, 2024. Reports suggest the annual multi-day conference could be heavy on generative AI.\n\nWhether it’s as heavy on AI as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google’s recent I/O 2024 event remains to be seen. Regardless, I’m quite bullish on Apple’s near-term future as it looks to bring the AI tech up a notch for its coming iOS 18. With a ChatGPT deal reportedly close to being inked, AAPL stock may have enough drivers to take it right back to all-time highs of close to $198 per share by year’s end.\n\nAt 29.15 times trailing P/E, AAPL stock is getting somewhat frothy again. I view the multiple as worth paying if it means that Siri is going to get a heck of a lot smarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple, Berkshire Hathaway (Class B), Amazon, Alphabet (Class C), and American Express.

        "title": "D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.",
        "content": "The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech.\n\nNo longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley.\n\nInstead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG,GOOGL).\n\n\"They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,\" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. \"And they're doing it for a reason.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference on March 21, as he announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The case was filed in New Jersey. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers.\n\nProsecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals.\n\nThe government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division.\n\nIt’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country.\n\n\"I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,\" Arteaga said.\n\nRoss is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.\n\nOutside of D.C. and a few other popular antitrust districts, Ross said, \"antitrust is like a hen's tooth — there are very few cases, and most average federal district judges have heard zero antitrust cases.\"\n\nD.C.'s dominance\n\nD.C. has long been the chosen spot for many of the most prominent antitrust cases in US history, including landmark cases against AT&T (T) and Microsoft in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nIts dominance extends back even further in time.\n\nSince 1899, the earliest year records are available, the DOJ filed 391 antitrust cases in the district.\n\nThat is nearly double the next closest counts of 222 filings in the Northern District of California and 220 in the Southern District of New York.\n\nStory continues Then-Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates at a June 2000 press conference in Redmond, Wash., to discuss the Justice Department's antitrust case against his company. (DAN LEVINE/AFP via Getty Images) (DAN LEVINE via Getty Images)\n\nIt held its dominance for most of the last decade as well. D.C. was home to the most new cases or tied for that title from 2015 through 2022.\n\nThat changed last year. In 2023, the government filed more antitrust cases in several places outside D.C., including states like Michigan and Oklahoma.\n\nWhen factoring in private antitrust suits, the district with the most combined competition suits last year — totaling 42 — was the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Federal district courts in New Jersey, Illinois, and New York followed.\n\nThe government's shift away from D.C. is happening at a time when there are rising concerns within the legal community about judge shopping in hopes of sympathetic rulings and state and federal governments intervening in private antitrust litigation.\n\nBills to disrupt judicial power in single-judge districts have been introduced in the Senate, and the Judicial Conference recommended changes to the case assignment process in March.\n\nChanging course\n\nThe Biden White House started its campaign against Big Tech close to home, in the D.C. District Court. That's where the FTC, under its Biden-nominated Chair Lina Khan, refiled an action against Facebook in 2021.\n\nThat case, first brought during former President Trump’s administration, alleged that the social media giant illegally blocked competition through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nIt also took over another case filed in D.C. by the prior administration, against Google, challenging the company’s online search dominance. A ruling from the judge in that case is expected soon.\n\nThen prosecutors changed course and veered away from D.C.\n\nIn December 2022, the FTC chose the US District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge Microsoft’s acquisition of video gaming giant Activision Blizzard. The effort failed, and the regulators appealed the matter to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nA month later, in January 2023, the DOJ, joined by eight state attorneys general, went after Google in a second antitrust case, this time in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Prosecutors alleged Google abused its monopoly in the digital advertising technology market.\n\nIn September of 2023, the FTC and 17 states sued Amazon in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The suit accused the retail giant of illegally monopolizing online marketplace services.\n\nThen this year in March, the DOJ and a group of state attorneys general sued Apple in the US District Court in New Jersey. The prosecutors claimed Apple illegally abused its dominance in the smartphone market.\n\n'Trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit'\n\nNew Jersey is a less logical place for the government to challenge Apple when compared to some of the other cases outside D.C.\n\nAmazon was targeted in the Washington district, where the company is headquartered, and Microsoft was sued in the Bay Area, where it has a significant physical footprint.\n\nBut Apple isn't domiciled in New Jersey nor does it have dominant operations there.\n\nOne factor that may help explain the government's choice is that appeals from New Jersey's federal trial courts are heard by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which in recent years has handed down decisions that could favor the government's claims against the iPhone maker.\n\n\"I think I think that the DOJ concluded that the case law was much more favorable for the Third Circuit as opposed to the Ninth Circuit,\" Arteaga said. Apple CEO Tim Cook in April. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAs for the case against Google in Virginia, the DOJ may be looking for a quick turn. The Eastern District court has earned its \"rocket docket\" nickname for the speed with which it handles litigation.\n\n\"I think there probably is an element of trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit,\" Ross said.\"Whether that's going to pay off for them or hurt them, I don't know.\"\n\nThe tactic, he said, could lead to more chaos in the law and increase the chances of getting one of the cases heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nKeith Harrison, also a partner in Crowell & Moring’s litigation practice, said bringing the cases against the country's most dominant and consumer-facing companies could prove valuable for the administration, win or lose, as it tries to communicate its agenda to a broader population.\n\n\"This [Apple] case is going to be a big case, wherever it's brought,\" Harrison said. \"But in New Jersey, it’s going to be the biggest case in that courthouse, and in local news on a regular basis.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Amazon on Wednesday slashed layers of middle management in some of its customer service divisions as part of an organizational restructuring, Fortune has learned.\n\nThe cuts affected more than 100 customer service managers working in Level 5 and Level 6 middle management positions both in call centers and virtually. Impacted employees worked mainly in either the U.S. or India. Some of the managers first realized something was up when their computer systems suddenly shut down during their workday, according to one source.\n\n\"We have had more and more work added, 12-16 hour days, maximum stress to be cut free without a thought or a warning,\" one of those impacted by the cuts told Fortune.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said that the restructuring was intended in part to shrink the distance between customers and customer service leaders. The layoffs impacted less than 1 percent of the global Amazon customer service workforce, the company said, but it was unclear what percentage of the customer service division's management team was impacted.\n\n“As part of a shift in how our Worldwide Customer Service organization is structured, we’ve identified a relatively small number of roles that are no longer required,\" Amazon spokesperson Montana MacLachlan said in a statement. \"We did not make these decisions lightly, and we are committed to supporting employees whose roles are affected during their transition.\"\n\nThe affected US employees will receive pay and benefits for 60 days plus severance, the company said.\n\nThe layoffs come two weeks after Amazon posted strong first-quarter financial results with more than $143 billion in revenue and $10 billion in profit. Amazon under CEO Andy Jassy has finally hit an inflection point where it can both invest heavily in long-term bets like generative AI while at the same time pumping out needle-moving profits. The company has reached this point, in part, due to Jassy's willingness to oversee the largest corporate layoffs in Amazon's history in recent years and demand that his leaders continually squeeze out excess costs wherever possible. Amazon divisions such as AWS, Prime Video, and Twitch have all cut hundreds of employees this year.\n\nAmazon has also worked this year to shift major logistics costs from its own books to those of third-party merchants in the form of new, controversial seller fees.\n\n\"[W]e don’t believe that we’re at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side,\" Jassy told Wall Street analysts during its earnings call last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNews of some of the customer service layoffs first surfaced in a LinkedIn post written by a former Amazon general manager named Tony Carr.\n\nAre you an Amazon manager impacted by these layoffs or an Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "title": "Jeff Bezos revealed his secret to Amazon’s success 25 years ago: ‘I asked everyone around here to wake up terrified every morning, their sheets drenched in sweat’",
        "content": "Back in the 90s, Jeff Bezos went on record as hoping his employees would wake up on the wrong side of the bed—for the greater good, or for the customer at the very least.\n\nToday marks the anniversary of when the former online bookstore went public in 1997 with an original IPO price of $18 per share, catapulting Bezos into millionaire status almost immediately. Now, Amazonshares are going for $185.99 each as of market close, Bezos is worth more than $200 billion, and the company sells almost everything under the sun (including, but really not limited, to books).\n\nA quarter of a century ago, in 1999, when Bezos was CEO, he revealed his nascent hard-line leadership strategy with CNET's Wendy Walsh. Two years after Amazon first went public, Bezos was already a billionaire, sharing his take on what built his booming e-commerce business. Praising his employees for being “the hardest working, most talented, most passionate, most customer-focused,” group of people, Bezos really hammered home the customer-service part.\n\nTaking it a step further than satisfaction guaranteed, he seemingly suggested that if workers aren’t waking up in abject fear of disturbing their customer base, then they’re doing it wrong. “I asked everyone around here to wake up terrified every morning, their sheets drenched in sweat,” he said. The purported goal was not to have a dehydrated Silicon Valley office staff, but to ensure that no one rests on their laurels.\n\nOf course, he implored employees “to be very precise about what it is they’re afraid of,” instead of waking up in wet sheets for the sake of it, presumably.\n\n“They shouldn’t be afraid of our competitors; they should be afraid of our customers because those are the folks we have a relationship with,” Bezos said. “Those are the folks who send us money,” he added.\n\nIn the interview, Bezos noted that things could always change on a dime for Amazon.com. Recognizing that the company wasn’t long-lasting yet, it could “still lose our whole opportunity to make that little bit of history” if they don’t “focus obsessively on the customer.”\n\nBezos’ fixation on his clients is not unlike an unrequited crush, fueled by the knowledge of the other playing hard to get or being temperamental. “I believe that our customers are loyal to us right up until the second that somebody else offers them better service,” he said. Even the current Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has spoken about Bezos’ demands of his workers.\n\n“Watching Jeff, I have never seen anybody with higher standards,” Jassy said at Fortune’s World Economic Forum in Davos this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis esteeming of the customer appears to come at a price, or at least some controversy. Some workers have called Bezos and Amazon out for harsh conditions. Bezos’ mindset has since come under fire as his company and net worth grew. In 2015, the New York Times released an explosive feature regarding the high standards at Amazon which included, at times, working past midnight, a tense company culture, and simply a lack of work-life balance for the sake of a high salary and belief in the mission.\n\nYears later, in 2023, three Amazon drivers filed a class action lawsuit against the company as they claimed they went through “inhumane conditions” and were unable to stop work in order to use the bathroom. Issues continue within the warehouses, as The U.S. Department of Labor announced in the same year that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found workers were exposed to hazardous conditions.\n\n“They’re more concerned about profit,” Michael Verrastro, a former Amazon warehouse worker, told The Guardian in regards to employee safety.\n\nIn Bezos’ words, they’re concerned about the customer.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

They are stirring up excitement and getting the ball rolling for a hot year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is one of the most exciting fintech companies of recent years. Formerly known as Square, Block has some of the most popular payment processing technology and operates the payment-sharing platform CashApp. While Block is under federal investigation for compliance issues, many expect the company to prevail.\n\nBlock established its goal of higher profit margins and “the rule of 40, ” confirming its position as a profitable company by 2026. To ensure this, Block laid off employees in January until profits rise.\n\nSo far this year, Block is off to a great start. Q1 saw a record quarterly net income of $472 million and gross profit of $2.09 billion. That represents a 22% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Cash App’s gross profit grew by 25% YOY and Square’s by 19%.\n\nClearly, Block is hot, coming from such a promising first quarter. And, it has exciting plans to sustain this momentum. One of Block’s most promising future projects is its continued investments in Bitcoin. Block has incorporated ways for users to buy and convert cash into Bitcoin and saw a gross profit of $80 million from Bitcoin in Q1.\n\nWith the company’s promising performance and continued dedication to improving its profitability and worthiness as a stock, investors should buy and hold with confidence as Block continues to rise in prominence.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the largest beverage companies, and many think of it as the only true rival to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). However, Pepsi has a substantial edge over Coca-Cola because its products and market reach are much more diversified. Pepsi not only has extremely popular beverages but also has a solid foothold in food.\n\nPepsi’s two leading food sellers, Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods, are at the head of its food business. These two companies made up over half of Pepsi’s sales over the last year leading into this quarter. Despite a recall that damaged sales of Quaker products, Pepsi managed a 2.3% net revenue increase and a 6% increase in EPS under GAAP in Q1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, this isn’t the first time Pepsi has proven its resilience and ability to overcome challenges while performing exceptionally. PEP maintained a healthy operating margin and has been a consistently growing stock for many years. It thrives with celebrity-endorsed campaigns and innovative product placement at unique events.\n\nTherefore, investors can get PEP while it’s hot and then rest easy as it generates consistent profits for years to come.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the largest companies and best-performing stocks ever, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rarely a bad time to buy. However, this month is another time that investors should consider buying the e-commerce giant.\n\nWith the heavy competition surrounding AI and cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) reigns as the top player, owning over 30% of the market. After collaborating on the proclaimed “super chip” GB2000 with tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AWS has announced an exciting partnership extension between these two behemoths to advance generative AI innovation.\n\nA deal will likely extend and widen AWS’s lead over major competitors like Microsoft and Google. In addition, Amazon continues to make massive investments in AI players like Anthropic, the largest competitor to generative AI giant ChatGPT.\r\nAnd, AMZN continues to dominate on the e-commerce side as well. Net sales increased 13% YOY in the first quarter, and net income increased to $10.4 billion. Operating cash flow jumped by 82% over the trailing twelve months, and Amazon has shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon Workers Say They Struggle to Afford Food, Rent",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Five years after Amazon.com Inc. raised wages to $15 an hour, half of warehouse workers surveyed by researchers say they struggle to afford enough food or a place to live.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market How One of the World's Oldest Hedge Funds Went Bankrupt Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies Slovakia PM Robert Fico Shot in Assassination Attempt OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever Is Leaving the Company\n\nThe national study, published Wednesday by the University of Illinois Chicago’s Center for Urban Economic Development, asked US employees about their economic wellbeing, including whether they’d skipped meals, went hungry, or were worried about being able to make rent or mortgage payments.\n\nFifty-three percent of respondents reported that they’d experienced one or more forms of food insecurity in the prior three months, and 48% experienced one or more forms of housing insecurity. Workers who said they took unpaid time off after getting hurt on the job were more likely to report trouble paying their bills, the researchers found.\n\n“It’s not necessarily that Amazon’s an outlier,” said Sanjay Pinto, who co-authored the study with Beth Gutelius. Still, “they’re certainly not taking the lead in creating family-sustaining jobs.”\n\nAmazon has long been criticized for its treatment of employees, especially those who pack and ship boxes in its warehouses. Much of the criticism has focused on injuries that have exceeded the rate of logistics industry peers. Amazon has pledged to make its warehouses safer, in part by automating aspects of the job that require repetitive motions. Pinto and Gutelius examined injuries among Amazon’s ranks in a report published in October before turning their focus to workers’ economic circumstances.\n\nThe Seattle-based company is the second-largest private-sector employer in the US behind Walmart Inc. Amazon accounts for about 29% of the US warehousing industry workforce, the researchers estimate. As such, the company plays a leading role in setting pay and working conditions of a sector transformed by e-commerce.\n\nThe 98-question online survey sought out Amazon employees through social media advertising, targeting warehouses and neighborhoods that host company facilities. The researchers also sprinkled in quality checks to weed out responses from people who appeared to be giving inauthentic responses.\n\nA total of 1,484 workers in 42 states gave enough information to be included in the results. For the portions dealing with economic security, the sample size varied between 1,306 and 1,472 respondents. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. The work was funded by the Ford Foundation, Oxfam America and the pro-labor nonprofit National Employment Law Project.\n\nStory continues\n\nA third of survey respondents reported using government-funded programs – primarily food stamps or Medicaid – in the last three months. That echoes a 2020 analysis by the US Government Accountability Office, which found Amazon was among the biggest employers of people receiving food assistance in nine states that reported the data.\n\nAmazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment made after the survey’s publication early Wednesday. Responding to the publication of the survey’s prior installment, a company spokesperson dismissed the report, saying it was “not a ‘study’ — it’s a survey done on social media, by groups with an ulterior motive.”\n\nAmazon’s median US employee was paid $45,613 in 2023, up from $41,762 the year before, the company said in a filing last month. The company says employees in warehousing and transportation are paid more than $20.50 an hour, on average. The survey, which was conducted between April and August 2023, excluded managers and skews a bit lower: Most respondents reported wages from $16 to $20 an hour.\n\nSome 65% of workers who come to Amazon earn more than they were making at their previous employer, the survey shows. And the same percentage of workers report receiving a raise while working at the company. Moving up the ranks in Amazon’s assembly-line like warehouses is a tougher proposition: Just 13% of workers reported receiving a promotion during their time at the company, survey data showed.\n\nRespondents who joined Amazon from another company were most likely to have previously worked in food preparation and services, sales and manufacturing.\n\n“The story of Amazon is a sad story of the declining expectations of American workers of their employer,” said study co-author Gutelius, a longtime researcher of logistics and warehouse work.\n\n--With assistance from Spencer Soper.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits The DNA Test Delusion US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports Elon Musk’s Big AI Contradiction\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Growth Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "If you think you’ve missed the rally in high-flying growth stocks, think again. Even though the market is close to all-time highs, many well-known growth stocks still have plenty of room to run. Owing to the bear market that ran for most of 2022 and into 2023, many growth stocks are still in recovery mode and only now approaching their former highs.\n\nAdditionally, many growth stocks are benefiting from sector-specific catalysts, whether it be demand for artificial intelligence products, a rebound in online advertisements, or the continued strength of consumer spending. Growth stocks should also catch a tailwind once the Federal Reserve finally starts to lower interest rates later this year and into 2025.\n\nHere is a look at Wall Street favorites: three growth stocks with strong buy ratings for May 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) AI stocks to Buy, Close-up of letters \"AI\" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks. ai chip stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n\nThe consensus view among 24 Wall Street analysts is that chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a strong buy. The median price target on the shares is $1,571.55, implying an 18% upside from current levels.\n\nAnalysts agree that Broadcom is likely to benefit from continued demand for microchips and semiconductors, particularly the ones that power artificial intelligence models.\n\nBroadcom is next scheduled to report earnings on June 12. Astute investors might want to take a position in AVGO stock before the next financial results are released, given that the company’s most recent print in March was strong.\n\nBroadcom managed to beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. Management emphasized that they continue to see strong demand for their chips in AI data centers.\n\nOne of Broadcom’s strengths is its diversification. The company’s chips and semiconductors are used in sectors ranging from networking and broadband to wireless and industrial applications. Moreover, AVGO stock has more doubled in the last 12 months.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rates a strong buy from the 41 professional analysts covering its progress. The median price target on AMZN stock is $220, which is nearly 20% higher than the current share price.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the lowest price target of $200 a share is about 8% higher than where the stock is trading right now. Analysts like both the improved growth and cost controls they’re seeing from Amazon.\n\nThe company’s financial results from this year’s first quarter were exceptional, driven by accelerating growth in online advertising and cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing unit, recorded $25 billion of revenue and accounted for 62% of total operating profit in the quarter. Advertising sales surged 24% from a year earlier to $11.80 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a sign that the company’s cost-cutting measures are working, operating income soared more than 200% during the first quarter to $15.30 billion. About the only thing people could criticize about the earnings report is that Amazon didn’t declare its first quarterly dividend payment to shareholders. AMZN stock is up about 65% in the last 12 months.\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nShares of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) have enjoyed a big run, rising about 80% in the last year and gaining more than 550% over the past five years.\n\nStill, analysts see more runway ahead.\n\nThe 19 analysts tracking Eli Lilly rate its stock a strong buy with a median price target of $891.59, which is 17% higher than current levels. The lowest price target of $740 is closer to where the shares are trading now.\n\nAt the end of April, Eli Lilly delivered solid Q1 financial results and raised its forward guidance as sales of its weight-loss drug takeoff. The Q1 print included the first full quarter of weight-loss drug Zepbound’s sales. The drug, which was approved by regulators last fall, reported $517.4 million in Q1 revenue. Executives said they’re struggling with shortages of Zepbound due to exceptionally strong global demand.\n\nSome analysts have forecast that Zepbound could post more than $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market, and that it might become the biggest selling drug of all time. Analysts also agree that the weight-loss drug will continue to power Eli Lilly’s revenue.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in LLY. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years. He spent five years as a staff reporter at The Wall Street Journal, and has also written for The Washington Post and Toronto Star newspapers, as well as financial websites such as The Motley Fool and Investopedia.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Tyler Technologies TYL recently equipped the Florida Department of Corrections (“FDC”) with its payment and deposit solutions to manage money transfer services for correctional facilities throughout Florida.\n\nThis solution is set to replace FDC's paper-based processes with digital ones, broadening disbursement services, enhancing court-ordered payments, providing more resources for inmates to reduce recidivism and minimizing fees for families sending funds.\n\nThis collaboration improves the inmate trust management life cycle, including deposits, fund disbursement and court-ordered payment.\n\nTyler Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus Tyler Technologies, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nTyler Technologies, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Tyler Technologies, Inc. Quote\n\nPowered by Amazon’s AMZN cloud division, Amazon Web Services, the platform will be able to leverage the cloud ecosystem to smoothen the operations and enable instant and secured transfer of funds from the inmate’s guardians.\n\nThe platform will enable depositors to send funds to their wards using an app, online transaction or a secure lockbox. The fund can be availed by the respective inmates through a commissary account on a prepaid debit card.\n\nAdoption of Digital Payment Solution Aids Tyler’s Growth\n\nTyler is benefiting from its unified payment strategy in its Digital Solutions division, which has resulted in 288 new payment deals in the first quarter of 2024, adding significant value to its business model.\n\nTYL also benefits from public and federal organizations subscribing to its offerings. So far this year, the company has expanded its customer base by adding institutions like the Guam Department of Corrections, Illinois Police Department, Texas Office of Court Administration, Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and City of Edina. The public and federal organizations that go for multi-year deals provide stable and consistent revenue streams.\n\nHowever, its near-term growth prospects are likely to be hurt by delays in the procurement process and lengthening sales cycles amid macroeconomic headwinds. Also, many of its customers are expected to face budget pressures in the near term. High investments in R&D initiatives are likely to hurt margins while intensifying competition is expected to keep pricing under pressure in the near term.\n\nZacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Tyler carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of TYL and AMZN have returned 23.1% and 68.2%, respectively, over the past year.\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are AppFolio APPF and Alphabet GOOGL, each sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "content": "Tanking Profit Overshadowed Alibaba's AI Growth And Reignited Domestic E-Commerce\n\nOn Tuesday, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) reported its net profit took quite a dive during the fiscal fourth quarter, after already having a hard time throughout 2023 as it underwent its largest-ever corporate restructuring.\n\nFourth Fiscal Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, Alibaba posted revenue grew 7% YoY to 221.9 billion yuan, which amounts $30.7 billion, as it boosted domestic e-commerce sales. But, Alibaba reported its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders tanked as much as 86% YoY to 3.27 billion yuan, which is about $452 million, attributing the poor result to a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies, compared to last year’s quarter when it made a net gain.\n\nEarly signs of reignited e-commerce growth.\n\nAlthough Alibaba is still grappling with cautious consumers in China amid the economic slowdown, its core e-commerce business has improved due to its focus on low-cost goods. Taobao and Tmall division that represent its e-commerce segment reported 4% YoY growth to 93.2 billion yuan, accelerating from previous quarter’s 2% growth.\n\nCustomer management revenue which consists of sales received from services such as marketing that merchants get from Alibaba, reported 5% YoY growth, also improving from being flat in the previous quarter. International commerce business grew 45% YoY 27.4 billion yuan.\n\nCloud growth fails to impress, but AI rose to the task.\n\nThe cloud computing division is having a hard time to shine. Last year, Alibaba decided not proceed with the spinoff of the division that competes with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud. For the reported quarter, Cloud computing brought in 25.6 billion yuan to the revenue table, posting the same growth rate of 3% YoY from the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, AI-related revenue reported a triple-digit YoY growth. AI-revenue came from various sectors, including foundational model companies, internet companies, financial services and the automotive industry.\n\nA Big Week For Global AI Development\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched its new AI model, GPT-4o. Through a livestreamed event, Microsoft-backed OpenAI demonstrated its latest effort of expanding the use of its chatbot and improving its capabilities as it made a significant step when it comes to ease of use. Microsoft-backed Open AI demonstrated the capabilities of the new model that is able to even perceive the user’s emotion, help calm a user down before making a public speech as well as read a story in a different tone or even sing it. OpenAI also touted the fact the new model can act as a translator even in audio mode. Moreover, by solving math equations and helping to write codes, GPT-4o  is a strong contender to Microsoft-made GitHub Copilot.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, Alibaba did report its profit plummeted, but its core business as well as the promising AI segment are growing, both of which are the main heroes of its storyline and future prospects.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Netflix strikes three-season NFL deal, will air two games this year",
        "content": "Netflix (NFLX) has won the streaming rights to two National Football League (NFL) games set to air Christmas Day, the company announced in a post on X Wednesday morning.\n\nIt's a surprising development given the streaming giant has previously said it wanted to avoid investing in live sports content.\n\nThe doubleheader matchups will be announced once the NFL releases its full schedule Wednesday evening. The company will reportedly pay less than $150 million per game, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIn addition to this year's games, the company also revealed it will be streaming at least one holiday game per year as part of a three-season deal.\n\n\"Last year, we decided to take a big bet on live — tapping into massive fandoms across comedy, reality TV, sports, and more,\" Netflix Chief Content Officer, Bela Bajaria said in a news release. \"There are no live annual events, sports or otherwise, that compare with the audiences NFL football attracts. We’re so excited that the NFL’s Christmas Day games will be only on Netflix.\"\n\nNetflix had previously maintained that it wants to focus on \"sports entertainment\" instead of paying for the rights to live sports, which can be expensive for media companies. In the past, the company has released docuseries and sports-adjacent content like \"The Quarterback,\" \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive,\" \"Full Swing,\" and \"Break Point,\" in addition to live sporting events like the \"Netflix Cup\" celebrity golf tournament, which aired late last year.\n\nOne recently announced partnership seemed to deviate from that status quo. In January, Netflix announced a 10-year deal with TKO Group Holding's WWE (TKO) that will bring WWE’s flagship program Raw, a live wrestling production, to the streaming service beginning in 2025.\n\nBut at the time, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the inclusion of the program did not signal a change in its overall sports strategy, describing the deal as \"unique\" compared to the global sports rights of professional leagues like the NBA or UFC.\n\nWall Street analysts and industry watchers have long predicted Netflix will eventually be forced to go all-in on sports, describing live sports as the last frontier of streaming amid a deteriorating cable bundle.\n\n\"Eventually we expect Netflix to move into live sports, particularly as it scales in [free cash flow] generation and has the ability to invest in major sports rights around the world,\" Morgan Stanley said in a report published last June. \"In addition, as its advertising capabilities scale, we think live sports will fit well into its content offering.\"\n\nStory continues US Kansas City Chief's american football players Patrick Mahomes (R) and Travis Kielce (L) arrive for the premiere of Netflix's docuseries \"Quarterback\" at the Tudum Theatre in Los Angeles, on July 11, 2023. (Photo by Chris Delmas / AFP) (Photo by CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty Images) (CHRIS DELMAS via Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, the NFL has recently begun to include more streamers on the list of partners with exclusive rights to its games.\n\nIncluding Netflix's deal, the league now has exclusive partnerships with four streaming platforms for the upcoming 2024/25 season: NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), which will air the Green Bay Packers' week one matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles in Brazil; Disney's ESPN+ (DIS), which will carry one international game; and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN), which will host one wild card playoff game this year, in addition to its Thursday Night Football package.\n\nAs a reminder, Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide. Sunday Ticket can be purchased as an add-on package on YouTube TV or as a standalone à la carte service on YouTube Primetime Channels.\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for media giants as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable or streaming service fee to access sports over other types of content.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Streaming Stocks Capitalizing on Rising Demand for Bundling",
        "content": "As the streaming landscape continues to evolve, strategic partnerships and bundled offerings represent a concerted effort by companies like Comcast CMCSA, Amazon AMZN and Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, among others, to streamline consumer options, retain subscribers and achieve profitability in an increasingly saturated market.\r\n\r\nWith the average U.S. consumer subscribing to four streaming services and spending around $61 per month, according to Deloitte's Digital Media Trends report, retaining loyal subscribers has become a challenge.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL, for instance, has been offering Apple One since late 2020. It combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, both of which merged their respective services last year.\r\n\r\nWhile the concept of bundling is not new, the partnership between competing media companies is gaining traction. Bundling multiple services into a single offering aims to provide a more convenient and cost-effective solution for users.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nComcast to Offer Apple TV, Netflix, Peacock in a Bundle\n\nRecently, Comcast announced the upcoming launch of a new bundled offering called StreamSaver. This bundle will combine the company's own Peacock platform with popular services like Netflix NFLX and Apple TV+. Comcast’s forthcoming package is an effort to reduce cancellation rates and provide a more efficient means of subscriber acquisition as the traditional cable TV business continues to deteriorate.\r\n\r\nThe StreamSaver package will be available later this month exclusively for Comcast's broadband Internet customers, ahead of another price hike for the standalone Peacock service, which goes into effect for new customers starting Jul 18 prior to the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. Beginning in mid-July, the price for Peacock Premium (with ads) will increase by $2 to $7.99 per month and that for Peacock Premium Plus (mostly ad-free) will go up by $2 to $13.99 per month.\r\n\r\nThis strategic move comes amid growing pressure on media companies to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability in an increasingly competitive market dominated by tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet-owned YouTube, among others.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMCSA's 2024 revenues is pegged at $123.16 billion, indicating 1.3% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.21 per share, indicating 5.8% year-over-year growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarner Bros. & Disney Bundle: A New Streaming Strategy?\n\nSeeking further scale in the streaming business, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a collaboration with Disney Entertainment for a new streaming bundle that would combine Disney+ and Disney’s Hulu with Warner Bros.’ Max, which includes an array of programming from the studio and its premium service, HBO. The new bundle will be available for purchase on any of the three streaming platform’s websites and offered as both an ad-supported and ad-free plan.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to boost revenues is to raise prices, but it comes with the risk of more people cancelling their subscriptions. The lowest-priced Max plan is currently $9.99 a month with advertisements. Disney+ with Hulu is also offered with ads for $9.99 a month.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, the collaborative effort is likely to put the two major comic-book rivals, Disney’s Marvel and Warner Bros.’ DC, together in a cooperative venture, beginning this summer in the United States. Disney+ has more than 100 million subscribers, while Hulu reaches another 50 million. Including the linear version of HBO, Max reaches more than 97 million homes.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox, set to debut later this fall. In December, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WBD's 2024 revenues is pegged at $41.36 billion, indicating 0.11% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at a loss of 34 cents per share, indicating 73.4% year-over-year growth.\n\nAmazon’s Aggressive Stance\n\nAmazon continues to explore ways to bolster its Prime program on the back of its streaming service, Prime Video. Recently, India-based pay TV provider Tata Play collaborated with Amazon Prime Video to offer a range of packages with access to Prime Video’s content to Tata Play DTH and Tata Play Binge customers.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has announced 69 titles on Amazon Prime Video for 2024, including movies, shows, and original content. Some of the highly anticipated shows and movies include Panchayat Season 3 and The Boys Season 4, both being Amazon Original series, scheduled for release on May 26 and Jun 13, respectively. The company is planning to release the second season of The Silent Service – The Battle of Tokyo Bay and a live-action drama adaptation of OSHI NO KO globally in winter 2024. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAmazon Fire TV is closely linked to AMZN's services, mainly promoting its own content and boasting a strong voice command system. It has expanded its sports selection and added customization features to Fire TV Channels, the platform's section for free ad-supported content.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN's 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.26 billion, indicating 11.04% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.54 per share, indicating 56.6% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nAmazon Fire TV competes directly with Alphabet’s Google TV, which has added free channels like Tubi, Plex and Haystack News directly to the Live tab. Google TV offers new free channels that users can watch without downloading or opening separate apps.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Top Cloud Computing Stocks to Invest In Before It’s Too Late",
        "content": "We live in a fast-paced modern world, and cloud computing and AI have become vital for every business in any sector. The use and demand for both innovations continue to grow, and investors holding cloud computing stocks have also been enjoying their gains. The benefits cloud computing provides (flexibility, scalability and cost-effectiveness) make it essential to most businesses.\n\nMoreover, as remote work surges, demand for cloud computing has risen sharply. With companies investing heavily in cloud software, investors are eyeing opportunities. Although there have been market declines for cloud computing, this doesn’t entirely mean a bad thing. It allows buying into cloud computing stocks.\n\nExperts also predict that the cloud computing sector will reach over $1.8 billion by 2031. Thus, if you’re considering buying cloud computing stocks, here are three I can highly recommend.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nFirst off the list of cloud computing stocks to own is Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW). Although the company is slightly smaller than other names in the industry, Snowflake should not be taken for granted. The company also works with the biggest names in the tech sector, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nSNOW stock saw a 20% decline after the company released excellent Q4 2023 earnings. Notably, the company’s poor guidance for 2025 pulled the stock down. Last year, SNOW stock saw a 38% increase, lagging behind Nasdaq’s 43%. The company anticipates more growth in 2024 from new products. However, analysts also think that generative AI projects must wait until 2025.\n\nSnowflake is now managed by its newly appointed CEO and former Google executive, Sridhar Ramaswamy. Ramaswamy is optimistic that 2024 will be a significant year of gains for Snowflake.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) comes second on this list of best cloud computing stocks. Recently, the company announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) during its Knowledge 2024 event. The announced collaboration included plans to use generative AI in ServiceNow products. The new ServiceNow Now Assist and Microsoft Copilot integration combines two AI assistants, streamlining enterprise productivity tasks.\n\nBy merging Now Assist’s intelligence with Microsoft Copilot, employees can access help seamlessly, regardless of the platform. “We’re pioneering a new era of AI collaboration,” said CJ Desai, ServiceNow’s COO.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, ServiceNow fosters strong client loyalty with a 98% renewal rate. In Q1 2024, the company saw a 24% revenue increase and a 131% rise in net income, driving profit margins and stock growth. Shares surged 62% over the past year and 159% over five years, now trading at a 76-times earnings ratio.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nOnce a creative software provider, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has expanded into cloud computing through its smart acquisitions. Purchases like Magneto, Workfront, and partnerships with Nvidia diversified its platform. Implementing generative AI into Firefly broadened creative possibilities.\n\nAdobe’s Q1 2024 revenue hit $5.18 billion, with $750 million from document cloud software and a $1.17 billion cash flow. With its strong market position and diverse offerings, Adobe remains a top choice in cloud computing.\n\nIn recent news, Adobe launched Acrobat AI Assistant, which is available for individual users and businesses, aiming to boost its AI competitiveness. Users subscribe to access features starting at $4.99/month. This move aligns Adobe with big tech’s early AI monetization strategies. The assistant enables users to generate insights and create content, enhancing document productivity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

And that's helped the company reach $2.26 trillion in market value. The reason behind all of the excitement? Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven their ability to power the most crucial of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks -- such as the training of large language models (LLMs) -- and the company now holds about 80% of the AI chip market.\n\nThis chip giant still has plenty of great days ahead, but two other AI stocks could join it in the $2 trillion club and even go on to surpass Nvidia's market value. These players have solid moats protecting their main businesses and have delivered strong earnings over time. Now their focus on AI could launch a whole new era of growth.\n\nWhile AI offers these players a boost in the coming years, increasing competition in the AI chip market may make it more difficult for Nvidia to grow as quickly as in recent times. Analysts expect annual growth of about 35% from Nvidia over the coming five years -- down from annual growth of more than 50% over the past five years.\n\nMy prediction is the following two AI growth stocks may be worth more than the chip giant in five years... Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in the two high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, with a solid moat thanks to its brand strength. And these businesses have helped the company generate billions of dollars in earnings annually.\n\nThough Amazon reported an annual loss in 2022 -- the first in nearly a decade as it struggled with rising inflation -- it quickly revamped its cost structure and delivered earnings growth a year later. Its efforts made Amazon more efficient and set the company on the right track for more growth down the road too.\n\nAmazon also should benefit from its investments in AI, particularly through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. AWS is the world's leading cloud-computing provider, putting it in the position to win as more and more companies launch AI projects. Everyone's talking about AI these days, but it's important to remember we're at the beginning of this story, so much of the growth is yet to come.\n\nAWS has prepared by offering customers all of the tools they need for their projects, from a wide range of chips for every budget to a fully managed service offering access to top LLMs.\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his recent letter to shareholders. AWS, historically Amazon's biggest profit driver, recently reached a $100 billion annual revenue-run rate and reported double-digit growth in sales and operating income in the recent quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Amazon's market value totals $1.94 trillion, but it could easily increase 16% to reach Nvidia's market capitalization -- and even surpass it -- as demand for AI projects gain momentum.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nYou may use Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) every day without even thinking about it. Meta is the owner of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of these apps daily. One reason Meta's moat is so strong is users know that if they leave Meta's social media for a rival platform, their contacts may not follow.\n\nAdvertisers understand this, so they flock to Meta with their marketing dollars, and this has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue annually for the technology company.\n\nIn recent times, Meta has put the focus on AI and has even said that its biggest investment area this year is in this high-growth technology. The company aims to launch AI across its apps, for example, by making an AI assistant available for every sort of use, from leisure to professional. Meta recently got the ball rolling by launching Meta AI, a conversational assistant in several English-speaking markets.\n\nThis should translate into revenue growth as users spend more time on Meta's apps, prompting advertisers to keep coming back and even increase their spending.\n\nMeta hasn't yet monetized its investment in AI, but the positive point here, as I mentioned above regarding Amazon, is that AI growth truly is in the early stages. That means AI could offer Meta a significant growth driver down the road.\n\nMeta today is worth $1.18 trillion, so it would have to gain about 90% to reach Nvidia's market value. That might seem like a lot, but Meta may have what it takes to make the leap. After all, over the past five years, the company's revenue and market value climbed 90% and 100%, respectively. So as the AI investment starts to bear fruit and boost earnings, Meta could replicate that performance -- and surpass Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alibaba Stock Alert: Is This the Turnaround Investors Were Waiting For?",
        "content": "Over the past year Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock lost one-third of its value but in recent weeks is running hot again. Shares are up 26% from their 52-week low.\n\nAlthough the Chinese e-commerce giant remains over 60% below its all-time high hit back in 2021, is this the inflection point investors have been waiting for? There is good reason to believe it is. Let’s dig in to find out why.\n\nToo Many Distractions\n\nAlibaba took its eye off the ball. It tried to be all things to all people. Beyond just its e-commerce platform, the company founded by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma put its finger into numerous pies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt operates a cloud computing business similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) web Serivces. Alibaba Health is a digital health care and pharmaceutical company.\n\nIt developed an launched an intelligent personal assistant, AliGenie, similar to Alexa. Cainiao is Alibaba’s logistics arms. It also operates DAMO Academy, a research and development institute.\n\nTo say the least, Alibaba has a lot of balls to keep up in the air while juggling intense competition in online shopping.\n\nAnd that was likely its biggest failing. By not focusing on its core business, Alibaba allowed competitors like PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu and Pinduoduo to steal market share. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has also proved to be a more nimble competitor.\n\nFocusing on What Is Important\n\nAlibaba now has a new management team in place that is focused on fighting back to regain momentum and market share. It is placing renewed emphasis on its flagship Taobao and Tmall apps with greater attention being placed on Chinese consumers (Alibaba also operates several marketplaces in international markets).\n\nPart of that effort, according to chairman Joe Tsai, is a recently created capital management committee dedicated to divesting noncore assets, including several Alibaba’s physical retail businesses.\n\nAccording to Tsai, as of February, the e-commerce giant has already “exited $1.7 billion in noncore investments.”\n\nManagement is also attempting to restore value to shareholders by increasing its stock buyback program by $25 billion.\n\nGreenshoots Are Appearing\n\nThe results are beginning to gain traction. Although there remains a lot of work to accomplish yet, Alibaba is seeing growth where it counts.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Ronald Keung says domestic parcel volumes jumped over 20% in April compared to a year ago and surged over 30% over China’s Labor Day holiday that began May 1. He says sales at both Taobao and Tmall were running far ahead of the national average.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt will not show up right away in Alibaba’s financials, but investors can expect to see more of it in the back half of 2024.\n\nWall Street is becoming more upbeat about China stocks in general and Alibaba in particular. UBS analysts lifted the largest stocks in the sector to “overweight” because the fundamentals and earnings of the businesses remain solid despite concerns over real estate and macroeconomic concerns in the country.\n\nThe stocks in the space also have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the government investing in those businesses to help stabilize the stock market.\n\nSupport From All Sides\n\nBrendan Ahern, chief investment officer for the KraneShares investment management firm, says China’s stock market doesn’t have “circuit breakers” similar to U.S. markets that halt trading during excess volatility.\n\nAs a result, the government acts as a buyer of last resort. Recently the government has been buying up shares of mainland stocks, particularly megacap companies.\n\nThis is providing a floor of support to stocks like Alibaba, and likely helps account for the turnaround in its shares since mid-April. The stock is up almost 20% over the past month.\n\nImproved fundamentals, a renewed focus on its core business, growing sales and government support suggest Alibaba stock is ready to move higher. While it has made strong gains in just a short amount of time, there is plenty of runway for future growth.\n\nThe stock trades at 15 times trailing earnings, just 10 times estimates and Wall Street sees BABA stock growing profits 10% annually for the next five years.\n\nAlibaba is a discounted stock ready to rise. It’s the inflection point investors were waiting for.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 86%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are firmly in control on Wall Street. Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have respectively rallied by 19%, 36%, and 56%, as well as hit fresh all-time highs.\n\nWhile certain sectors and industries have played a role in pushing the broader market higher, the \"Magnificent Seven\" are attributed with putting the weight of Wall Street on their proverbial backs and lifting the stock market to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's view of the Magnificent Seven stocks is mixed\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from each of these businesses handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, they provide well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright moats within their respective industries.\n\nFor example, Alphabet's Google accounts for nearly 91% of worldwide internet search share, while Amazon's e-commerce marketplace oversaw close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are also the respective No.'s 1, 2, and 3 in cloud infrastructure service market share by enterprise spend.\n\nDespite the clear-cut catalysts the Magnificent Seven stocks bring to the table, not all Wall Street analysts share an optimistic view for their future. Based on bottom of the barrel price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three Magnificent Seven components could plunge by up to 86%.\n\nMeta Platforms: Implied downside of 24%\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven constituent that at least one analyst believes could meaningfully decline in the not-too-distant future is social media colossus Meta Platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski, who often takes a contrarian view on some of Wall Street's leading businesses, set a price target of just $360 on shares of Meta. This suggests 24% downside to come, based on the $476.20-per-share closing price, as of May 10.\n\nAccording to Slowinski, Meta lacks new revenue streams, when compared to the other companies spending big on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. This lack of new revenue channels, coupled with the company's forecast of higher capital expenditures tied to AI, have Slowinski believing Meta could underperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Meta is the undisputed leader among social media platforms. It owns the top social media \"real estate\" globally, including the most-visited social site (Facebook), and lured 3.24 billion users to its family of apps on a daily basis during the quarter ended in March. Businesses understand they're not going to reach a broader set of eyeballs on any other social media platform, which tends to afford Meta exceptionally strong ad pricing power.\n\nMeta Platforms also benefits from lengthy periods of economic expansion. Since it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, the company would be vulnerable to a recession. At the moment, a few key indicators, including a historic drop in U.S. M2 money supply, do suggest an economic downturn is probable.\n\nHowever, recessions are short-lived. All 12 U.S. recessions since 1945 have endured between two and 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth last for multiple years, and occasionally even stick around for a decade. Ad-driven businesses thrive during these long-winded expansions.\n\nA final reason Slowinski may be forced to eat his words is Meta's balance sheet. The company closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated north of $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations through the first three months of 2024. In other words, it has the capital to take risks and aggressively invest in its future -- even if the payoff from those investments are a few years away from being truly material to its top and bottom line. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 31%\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that one Wall Street analyst views as anything but \"magnificent\" is semiconductor behemoth Nvidia.\n\nBased on a February note issued by analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, there's concern about demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerating graphics processing units (GPUs) peaking in the current year. With the prospect of slower growth on the horizon, Luria's low-water price target of $620 implies a decline of 31% for Nvidia's stock over the coming year.\n\nOn the bright side, Nvidia's GPUs have come to dominate AI-accelerated data centers. With demand handily outpacing supply, strong pricing power helped to more than triple Data Center segment sales in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28).\n\nBut Luria hit the nail on the head when it comes to competition. While most folks might be focused on external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are both rolling out AI-accelerators for enterprise data centers, it's internal competition from Nvidia's top customers that's the far bigger concern.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four-largest customers and comprise in the neighborhood of 40% of its net sales. But these four giants are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if this is purely for complementary purposes, demand for Nvidia's high-powered chips would likely wane after the current fiscal year.\n\nWhat's more, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation over the last three decades that didn't navigate its way through a bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors overestimate the uptake or adoption of new technologies. Since no company has benefited more from the rise of AI, Nvidia would, in theory, be hit the hardest if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nLuria's price target on Nvidia is likely to be reached.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 86%\n\nBut the disaster du jour among Magnificent Seven stocks, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street pundit, is electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla. Gordon Johnson, the CEO and founder of GLJ Research and longtime Tesla bear, believes shares will reach $23.53.\n\nThis weirdly specific price target was arrived at by applying a multiple of 15 times Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) in 2025 and working backwards using a 9% discount rate. Keep in mind this price target was issued earlier this year, and Tesla's consensus EPS for 2025 has declined since then. If Johnson's price target were to prove accurate, shares of Tesla would implode by 86% from where they closed on May 10.\n\nTesla has made a habit of proving skeptics wrong. For instance, it's the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit. Tesla recently introduced its fifth mass-production model (Cybertruck) and has the capacity to roll out more than 2 million EVs annually.\n\nHowever, headwinds are most definitely mounting for North America's leading EV company.\n\nAs an example, increasing EV and hybrid competition has coerced Tesla to slash the sales price of its primary production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. CEO Elon Musk has been clear that his company's price strategy is entirely based on demand. But even with these aggressive cuts, Tesla's inventory levels have soared and its operating margins are tumbling.\n\nTesla's efforts to transform into more than just a car company haven't gone swimmingly, either. Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has slowed dramatically, while Services segment gross margin is consistently in the low-to-mid single digits. Meanwhile, more than half of the company's pre-tax income during the March-ended quarter came from unsustainable sources (e.g., interest income and the sale of regulatory tax credits).\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that Musk has proved to be a tangible liability for the company. Many of Musk's promises, such as Level 5 autonomy and robotaxis, which are already baked into Tesla's valuation, have failed to come to fruition. The longer these claims go unfulfilled, the likelier it is that Tesla's massive valuation premium to other auto stocks will deflate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The EV Sector’s Hidden Gems: 3 Overlooked Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist",
        "content": "The 2024 U.S. presidential election and three rate cuts will keep the electric vehicle (EV) market in the spotlight this year. Both developments might benefit the sector, so it’s important to keep an eye on these top EV stocks to watch.\n\nAround 17 million electric cars are expected to be sold worldwide in 2024; China will lead with 45% of auto sales. What’s more, EVs are also expected to make up one in nine cars sold in the U.S. and one in four cars sold in Europe; in Q1 2024 Americans alone purchased 268,909 new electric vehicles.\n\nAs a further matter, policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will keep powering the sector, expected to grow by 9.82% between 2024 and 2028, reaching $906.7 billion in 2028. Expect both parties to provide further policy recommendations as the 2024 election approaches.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith secular tailwinds powering the sector, the first pick among these quality EV stocks to watch is the first profitable EV startup from China. Next up is a company with backing from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looking to produce 57,000 cars this year. Lastly, we’ll discuss an iconic American automaker aiming to make 2 million EVs by 2026.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car. Interior of Li Auto EV. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), known as China’s first profitable EV maker, shipped 28,984 cars in March, 39% more than the year-ago period, complimenting the launch of its first totally electric model, the Li MEGA, in a Spring 2024 launch event.\n\n​This electric MPV debuted in China with much enthusiasm. The MEGA, built on an 800-volt battery-electric platform, costs $77,782 and has multiple engines, a big battery pack for speedy charging and luxury interior choices, including reclining seats and a back entertainment system.\n\nWhat’s more, Li Auto also plans to spend almost $1 billion to build more than 5,000 high-speed EV charge points across China, the country accounts for roughly 60% of EV sales globally.\n\nInvestors will also be excited about Li Auto’s partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which aims to improve technologies for self-driving cars; this market could potentially be worth $62 billion by 2026.\n\nFinally, Li Auto is slashing the prices of all of its models except for the newly released Li L6, heating up the competition in China, especially for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA); no surprise analysts rate the stock a “Strong Buy,” with an 83% upside.\n\nThe Li L7, L8, L9 and the Li Mega MPV all have their prices cut between 18,000 and 30,000 yuan. The Li Mega type has the biggest price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMuch like Li Auto, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) is coming off a great Q1 2024, producing 13,980 vehicles and delivering 13,588 of them. As a result of these numbers, Rivian reiterated plans to make 57,000 cars this year.\n\nThe 57,000-car target is doable, considering the company celebrated the production of its 100,000th electric car in April, thanks to the addition of 623,000 square feet to its main factory site in Normal, Illinois.\n\nFurthermore, Rivian’s smaller and less expensive R2 and R3X models will attract customers looking for competitive prices, as affordability remains the biggest concern in greater EV adoption.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, Rivian’s stock is down 48% in 2024 owing to losing money on each vehicle in the previous several quarters. By 2024, it intends to improve cost management and production efficiency. Rivian’s finances are still robust, with $7.86 billion in cash to fund its present and future expansion, but $16.8 billion in losses within three years makes investors wary.\n\nStill, Rivian is doing all it can to allay these fears; pausing work on a new $5 billion factory in Georgia to save over $2.25 billion. When fully operational, the factory, built on a 2,000-acre plot of land east of Atlanta, could help make up to 400,000 cars each year.\n\nFord (F) Ford (F) trucks lined up on the lot of a Ford dealership.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Ford (NYSE:F) sold 20,233 EVs, up 86%, thanks to healthy sales growth for the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E.\n\nDespite the division’s deficit, Ford is aiming to produce 2 million EVs by 2026 by reducing capital expenses and shifting funds to this area. On top of this, Ford to establish a low-cost EV platform to make cheaper vehicles with larger profits.\n\nFord wants to produce 600,000 electrified vehicles by 2024, therefore its North American assembly sites are being upgraded, including Oakville in Ontario. By 2026, Ford plans to export automobiles from BlueOval City, its advanced automotive manufacturing hub in Tennessee.\n\nMoreover, Ford’s brand-new three-row electric cars, expected to launch in 2027, will help take advantage of new battery technologies.\n\nOverall, Ford’s sales, earnings and cash flow all went up in the first quarter of 2024. Even though the economy is volatile due to sticky inflation and waning EV demand, the Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro divisions will keep its finances stable and help it grow; a 20% upside and “Moderate Buy” rating accentuates Ford’s robustness.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s newly named cloud chief, Matt Garman, inherits a $100-billion-a-year business that’s as profitable as it has ever been. He also faces the daunting task of retaining the cloud-computing pioneer’s edge in the artificial intelligence age.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Biden Accuses China of ‘Cheating’ on Trade, Imposes New Tariffs Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe Five Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India\n\nA longtime Amazon Web Services engineering leader who was most recently sales chief, Garman, 48, will assume one of the most prominent positions in the technology industry when he succeeds Adam Selipsky next month.\n\nSelipsky, who has led AWS since 2021, will relinquish the role on June 3 “to move onto his next challenge,” Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday.\n\nThe cloud unit, the world’s largest seller of rented computing power and data storage, has long accounted for most of Amazon’s operating income, serving as a cash machine that gives the parent company flexibility to make big investments in other areas.\n\nBut AWS struggled in the last two years when businesses trimmed their technology spending following pandemic-era splurges. The cloud unit’s growth slowed to a record low last year, which executives attributed in part to Amazon’s own efforts to help customers save money. The unit held its largest-ever layoffs a year ago and has continued trimming since, even as it continues to hire for specific areas.\n\nThe division also stumbled out of the gate in the race to commercialize a new generation of artificial intelligence services, lagging behind rivals Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in bringing to market the systems that power such products as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nEarly versions of AWS’s AI products were deemed insufficient by some customers. Since then, the company has invested $4 billion in Anthropic, a well-regarded builder of generative AI tools. AWS is also building its own tools to rival ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers.\n\nSo while Microsoft and Google are widely seen as leaders in generative AI — which responds to users’ prompts with newly created text, voice or images — Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related business for years to come.\n\n“Regardless of how much or how little Adam Selipsky is responsible for AWS’s progression in AI, as CEO, he owns the outcome,” said Corey Quinn, the chief cloud economist at the Duckbill Group, a consulting firm that advises AWS clients. “And the outcome has not been terrific.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSelipsky, 57, said in a note to employees that he would “take the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities.” A spokesperson for AWS declined to comment beyond the executives’ memos.\n\nSelipsky was Jassy’s right hand during the cloud group’s early years, serving in a chief operating officer-like capacity that saw him lead sales, marketing and other roles. He left in 2016 to run Tableau, a Seattle builder of data visualization tools later sold to Salesforce Inc., before returning three years ago. His second stint at Amazon was a surprise to many AWS employees who had expected the job to go to Garman.\n\nGarman interned at Amazon in 2005 while still in business school at Northwestern University, and joined full-time the following year, helping to launch some of the first AWS products. He went on to run engineering teams working on Amazon’s on-demand computing power services, and began leading AWS’s sales and marketing teams in 2020, a sign to close watchers of the company that he was being groomed for the top job.\n\nPracticed Humility\n\nPeople who’ve worked with Garman describe him as a detail-oriented engineering manager in the Amazon mold, brimming with self-confidence and a practiced humility when dealing with customers or entering new markets. Like many of Amazon’s senior executives, he’s not considered a polished public speaker or gladhander. Garman doesn’t shy away from confrontation, challenging the assumptions of product teams in meetings and drilling down on specific data points.\n\n“Matt has an unusually strong set of skills and experiences for his new role,” said Jassy, who led AWS from its inception in the early 2000s until he was named to Amazon’s top job in 2021. “He’s very customer focused, a terrific product leader, inventive, a clever problem-solver, right a lot, has high standards and meaningful bias for action.”\n\nGarman said he’ll announce organizational changes in the coming weeks. One arrived on Tuesday: Amazon’s sustainability teams, which had reported to Selipsky, will move to communications chief Drew Herdener’s organization.\n\nShortly after he started at AWS, Garman was asked by a business school pal who worked in another Amazon unit how things were going at AWS, which at the time was a counterintuitive bet by an online retailer. Garman replied that he thought AWS would someday be a $1 billion business. His friend scoffed, Garman told Bloomberg in 2019.\n\nBy the time AWS publicly disclosed its sales almost a decade after that conversation, AWS was on track for almost $8 billion in annual sales.\n\n“We thought it would take a lot longer,” Garman said.\n\n(Updates with background throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges ‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jeff Bezos' Mom Was A Single Teen Who Took Him To Night School With Her As An Infant — She Made $190 A Month And Now She's Worth $30 Billion",
        "content": "The tale of Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon from his garage, is legendary, but the story of his mother, Jacklyn Bezos, is equally compelling. Jacklyn, a determined teenager in Albuquerque, New Mexico, overcame substantial obstacles. She faced financial hardship and societal pressures as a single teen mother, yet she managed to raise her son, who would become one of the world's richest individuals with a net worth of $205 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nNo generation before Gen Z has had this investment opportunity – How successful Zoomers plan to retire in their 30's. The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?\n\nWhile still in high school at 17, Jacklyn became pregnant and met with severe resistance from school administrators. They initially forbade her from continuing her education. Undeterred, Jacklyn challenged their decision, asserting, \"It didn't make any sense to me, so I pushed back and I kept on pushing back.\" Ultimately, the school relented under her persistence, though they imposed strict conditions on her return, such as restricted interaction with peers and tightly controlled entry and exit times.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Jacklyn persevered, graduating from high school and shortly after divorcing Bezos’s biological father, Ted Jorgensen. She supported herself and her son by working as a secretary, earning a modest $190 per month, which barely covered their expenses. To stay connected with her parents without the cost of a telephone, Jacklyn’s father set up a walkie-talkie system for daily check-ins.\n\nDriven to further her education, Jacklyn enrolled in night school, strategically choosing classes that allowed her to bring her infant son, Jeff, along. \"I would show up with an infant and two duffel bags,\" she said. One was filled with textbooks and baby supplies, the other with distractions for her son during class.\n\nTrending: If the United States had access to today’s high-yield savings accounts rates in 2015, it wouldn’t need to save another penny.\n\nIt was during these night classes that she met Mike Bezos, a Cuban refugee, who would later become Jeff’s stepfather and a significant figure in his life. The family relocated for Mike’s job, which delayed Jacklyn’s educational ambitions for years. Nonetheless, she returned to college as an adult, ultimately graduating from the College of Saint Elizabeth at age 40. \"When I graduated...I had never been more proud of myself. I felt 10 feet tall,\" she expressed.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a 1997 SEC filing, Jackie and her husband, Mike Bezos, invested $245,573 in Amazon. As the company grew into a global powerhouse, the initial investment ballooned to an estimated $958 billion. While they donated a significant portion of their shares to educational causes, Bloomberg estimates that their remaining holdings could be worth around $30 billion today.\n\nThe Bezos family story is not just a testament to overcoming adversity, but also a shining example of the profound impact parental support can have on a child’s trajectory. Jacklyn’s unwavering belief in her son, coupled with her willingness to take risks, transformed challenges into a legacy of success.\n\nRead Next:\n\n82% of Americans aren’t using this government secured 5% passive income stream, are you one of them?

        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Tuesday announced some of the biggest changes to its Search product in years, rolling out generative AI features to offer more complete and direct answers to queries.\n\nThe company will roll out its generative AI updates to US users beginning today and more than a billion people worldwide by the end of the year.\n\nThe announcement, part of Google’s I/O developer conference, brings a new look to Search via its AI Overview. The feature provides a brief, AI-generated answer to searches, coupled with a series of links to the sources cited in the response. An example of a search with AI Overview. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nGoogle is also working on answering more complex answers via an update in Search Labs — which offers users the ability to test upcoming capabilities. The company says you'll be able to search for a yoga or Pilates studio in Boston that offers discounts to new members and how far it is from Beacon Hill, and Search will provide an answer without you having to perform multiple searches. It will also allow you to do things like look for meal plans for a group or put together a vacation itinerary.\n\nThere’s also a new video search option coming to Search Labs, which enables users to take a video and use it as a search prompt.\n\nIn one example, the company says a user dealing with a problem related to a record player arm would be able to take a video of the issue, and Search would be able to provide an AI Overview explanation of the malfunction and how to address it.\n\nBut don’t expect to use this multistep or video search to be available today. Google says it’s coming to its Search Labs soon and only for English queries in the US for now. A multistep search using Google's new generative AI features. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nI’ve been using AI Overview and it's been a helpful addition to Search, whether I was looking for information about obscure video games from the 1990’s or how to treat a foot injury.\n\nAll of these functions come as part of Google’s effort to push generative AI out across its massive ecosystem of products including Android, YouTube, Gmail, and more.\n\nGoogle is the world leader in search, with Statcounter indicating the company controls 91% of the market compared to rival Microsoft (MSFT) Bing’s roughly 4%.\n\nGoogle’s Search is responsible for the vast amount of its advertising revenue, and any changes to its formula could impact advertiser spending. In 2023, Google’s Search & other business segments drove $175 billion of the company’s $307 billion in total revenue.\n\nThe company is also staring down increased competition from Amazon (AMZN), which saw advertising revenue jump 24% year-over-year from $38 billion in 2022 to $47 billion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, there remain rumblings that ChatGPT developer OpenAI is working on a search offering of its own. On Monday, OpenAI garnered headlines after showing off its latest features from GPT-4o, including new translation capabilities.\n\nIt's far from clear whether an OpenAI search engine would be able to pull away users from Google.\n\nBing, for instance, hasn’t been able to make much of a dent in the company’s market share despite adding its own generative AI features.\n\nBut ChatGPT is a popular tool and the brand name most associated with AI; if OpenAI manages to add the right mix of functionality and usability to this product, it could have Google sweating.

Price and Consensus Netflix, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. Quote\n\nNFLX’s Upcoming Japanese Content to Aid APAC Revenues\n\nNetflix has received increasing demand from Japan. This has prompted the company to invest more in Japan. Upcoming Japanese content includes title like Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf, Baki Hanma VS Kengan Ashura and My Oni Girl. These are expected to boost the company’s APAC revenues in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX's 2024 APAC revenues is pegged at $4.24 billion, indicating 12.8% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $18.3 per share, indicating 52.12% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report from GEM, Japan's market for subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services was valued at 505.4 billion yen in 2023, marking a 12.1% increase from the previous year. This upward trajectory has been ongoing since 2020, with steady expansion attributed to heightened interest in home entertainment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe notable players in Japan’s video-on-demand market are Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix, U-Next, Disney DIS and Warner Bros. Discovery WBD.\r\n\r\nAmazon recently enjoyed success of Japanese survival thriller series, Acma: Game, which premiered on Apr 7, 2024. Building on its success, the company is planning to release the second season of The Silent Service – The Battle of TokyoBay and a live-action drama adaptation of OSHI NO KO globally in winter 2024.\r\n\r\nU-NEXT has become a strong competitor in the market, steadily increasing its market share. In 2022, it surpassed Amazon Prime Video to become the second-largest player. U-NEXT experienced significant growth after merging with Paravi in July 2023.\r\n\r\nDisney is concentrating on creating Japanese content to expand its presence in the market. DIS’ first Japanese anime series, The Fable, was released earlier this year. It also has other exciting releases like Dragons of Wonderhatch and Tokyo Revengers: Tenjiku Arc in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nWarner Bros. Discovery is growing its footprint in Japan by partnering with a local telecommunications company called J:COM. It has collaborated with DC for a Japanese anime series called Suicide Squad Isekai, which is scheduled to release in July 2024. The company has announced that it will be producing more than 10 anime series per year.\r\n\r\nNetflix has remained the dominant player in Japan's SVOD market since 2019, despite experiencing slight declines in market share over the past two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky is stepping down, the tech giant announced on Tuesday, around three years after he made a return to the tech giant to replace Andy Jassy as CEO of the company's cloud computing division.\n\nSelipsky will be replaced by Matt Garman, who has spent around 18 years with the company and most recently served as the senior vice president of sales and marketing for AWS.\n\nIn a blog post, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that when he recruited Selipsky back to AWS after a stint as Tableau's CEO, \"we agreed that if he accepted the role, he’d likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he’d focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership.\" Before Tableau, Selipsky spent more than 11 years at Amazon during his first tenure.\n\n\"We were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team,\" Jassy added. \"Adam is now going to move onto his next challenge (after taking a well-deserved respite), and Matt Garman will become CEO of AWS, effective June 3rd.\"\n\nThe leadership change comes shortly after Amazon announced in its most recent earnings report that its revenue growth was accelerating in its cloud computing division and was on track to surpass $100 billion by the end of 2024. Company leaders also said that generative AI products and services were on track to bring in multiple billions in revenue this year.\n\nAt the same time, AWS has faced numerous challenges under Selipsky's leadership, with multiple rounds of layoffs, a period of revenue growth deceleration, and the optics among some industry observers that the company has been chasing competitors from behind during the generative AI boom.\n\nTo that end, Amazon has invested $4 billion into the AI foundational model company Anthropic, with AWS becoming the \"primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads.” As part of the tie-up, Anthropic has agreed to train and deploy future models using AWS AI chips.\n\nAre you a current or former Amazon Web Services employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "title": "7 Cheap Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is rapidly gaining traction, and investors are scrambling to get in on the action with cheap metaverse stocks. As technology continues to advance, the concept of a fully immersive, interconnected virtual world is becoming increasingly tangible. These cheap metaverse stocks should be on every investors’ radar.\n\nAlthough the technology so far has not met many investors’ expectations, I feel that we are just beginning to tap into the potential of the industry. We are using ‘metaverse-like’ technologies increasingly in our everyday lives: from cryptocurrencies to NFTs to VR/AR and much more. It could be a matter of time before these brands lift off to new heights, thus making them comparably undervalued.\n\nSo for this article, here are seven cheap metaverse stocks for investors to buy for May. I believe that these brands will be strong performers in the future, and therefore won’t stay cheap for much longer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A child playing Roblox on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Katya Rekina/ Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) operates a platform where users can create and play games. It has a vast user base and continues to focus on monetization strategies and partnerships, such as those with high-profile brands for advertising.\n\nThis year, RBLX has set a financial guidance with expected bookings of approximately $4.03 billion, up from analysts’ expectations of $3.98 billion, and aims for an adjusted EBITDA of around $490 million. The company plans to cap its capital expenditures related to infrastructure at about $100 million and anticipates a share dilution between 3% and 4%.\n\nAdditionally, RBLX is targeting a yearly growth in bookings of over 20% from 2025 to 2027, with an improvement in margins of 100 to 300 basis points annually over the same period​.\n\nLooking back at 2023, RBLX reported significant financial metrics including a 38% year-over-year increase in revenue for the third quarter, reaching $713.2 million. Despite these gains, the company reported a net loss of $277.2 million for the quarter.\n\nTrading at just 6.7 times sales, RBLX could be one of those undervalued metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is a leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. Unity basically provides some of the “picks and shovels” that allow the metaverse to come to life.\n\nThis year,  the company aims to support creators across the entire game development cycle with new AI features and a first look at Unity 6. They are also launching Unity Cloud, a platform aimed at broadening the usability of Unity’s tools in cloud environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also provided a financial outlook for 2024, projecting revenues between $1.76 billion to $1.80 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $425 million.\n\nUnity reported strong revenue growth, with a 38% increase year-over-year, and continued to invest in technology that advances its capabilities in real-time 3D content creation.\n\nStocks like U that provide the 3D engines for the metaverse to thrive may become in hot demand in later years, and of course it also benefits from the growth headwinds of the expanding gaming market as well.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its advanced graphics processing units that are essential for gaming and professional markets, including applications in the metaverse.\n\nNVDA is still my best pick for one of those undervalued metaverse stocks despite its high multiples for both sales and earnings.\n\nFinancially, NVDA has shown robust performance and has projected even stronger outcomes for the upcoming fiscal year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, NVDA expects revenue to be around $24 billion. This guidance exceeds Wall Street expectations.\n\nNVDA trades at 75 times earnings and 36 times sales. However, the expected growth rates for these metrics make them lower on their forward measures, at 39 times earnings and 22 times sales, respectively. This means that although these metrics may be high today, analysts are confident that NVDA’s fundamentals will improve in the future.\n\nThere’s also some potential for NVDA to do a stock split in the coming years, with it trading for nearly $900 per share at the time of writing, which could incur some indirect benefits to investors.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) provides an e-commerce platform that is expanding into the metaverse by enabling new forms of digital commerce and integration of NFTs.\n\nShopify’s metaverse strategy includes enhancing digital fashion, which represents a significant market opportunity projected to reach $50 billion by 2030. Digital fashion on Shopify allows for the creation of 3D clothing and accessories that are more sustainable and cost-effective.\n\nFinally, Shopify’s President has expressed optimism about the future of retail in the metaverse, emphasizing the importance of integrating commerce features into online platforms.\n\nAs one of the most popular web store builders, SHOP is positioning itself well to take advantage of the rising tide of metaverse products for store owners to tap into, potentially selling them on sites such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nAnalysts are very optimistic about SHOP’s near-term financial performance for FY2024, anticipating that its EPS will rise 944.33% to 1.04 this year. This then makes SHOP one of those undervalued metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) An image of a person wearing a VR headset looking up, a nebulous digital cloud in the upper corner\n\nSource: Vit-Mar/Shutterstock\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:VERS) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in companies heavily involved in the metaverse sector.\n\nThe financial data for VERS reveals an asset total of $5.74M, with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.58%, and a P/E ratio of 25.42. The fund distributes a dividend yield of 0.69% with an annual dividend of $0.28 per share and maintains a conservative payout ratio of 17.44%. It has shown strong performance with a 1-year return of 24.81%.\n\nKey stock holdings of the fund include leading tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) 4.97%, Nvidia 4.60%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 4.55%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 4.55%, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 4.38%.\n\nI think that VERS could be one of those undervalued picks for investors to consider if they’d like to invest in a broad-basket of metaverse stocks. It may go well with people who are particularly bullish on the sector, and its intersectionality with AI and robotics could further the bull case.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFastly (NYSE:FSLY) operates an edge cloud platform, which is crucial for delivering content with reduced latency. In addition to U, it’s one of those companies that provided the crucial infrastructure to make the metaverse a possibility.\n\nFSLY has issued guidance for 2024, forecasting total revenue to range between $555 million and $565 million. This represents a slight decrease from earlier projections of up to $585 million due to pricing pressures.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Fastly reported a positive operating cash flow of $11.1 million and continues to focus on optimizing operations despite a non-GAAP operating loss.\n\nI still believe that FSLY is an undervalued option for investors. For one, analysts have given the stock a 69.29% predicted upside from its current level. Its EPS also set to surge in the triple digits from FY2026 to FY2027, thus making it comparatively undervalued on an EPS basis.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) A concept image of the metaverse with two young adults wearing virtual reality headsets. undervalued metaverse stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and it’s becoming increasingly involved in the metaverse through its NFT marketplace.\n\nThis platform supports NFTs on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain and aims to introduce more blockchains in the future.\n\nCoinbase has also introduced a mobile DApp browser and a DeFi wallet, enhancing user interaction with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading. This includes a co-custodial hot wallet setup.\n\nHowever, in its first quarter of 2024, Coinbase experienced some challenges, notably a consensus revenue estimate reduction of 14%.\n\nStill, I am firmly bullish on COIN’s long-term prospects, and I also think that this year will be the one where cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shine, especially since many FAANG stocks could be seen as too overvalued for most investors’ tastes.\n\nCOIN could then be one of those undervalued metaverse stocks for investors to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon's cloud unit CEO Adam Selipsky to step down",
        "content": "The CEO of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud computing business, Adam Selipsky, is stepping down next month, the company announced Tuesday, punctuating a phase of rapid growth at the division and a broader transition in a tech sector that is scrambling to capitalize on the coming AI-led era.\n\nMatt Garman, senior vice president of sales and marketing at AWS, will replace Selipsky as CEO effective June 3, the company said.\n\nSelipsky's departure comes at a high point for AWS. The cloud services unit is rapidly expanding and has reached a significant milestone of generating a $100 billion run rate. Amazon's broader artificial intelligence strategy runs through AWS, the industry's top cloud service by market share. During the company's most recent earnings report, executives said cloud customers are increasingly signing up for bigger deals with longer commitments, many with generative AI components.\n\nAmazon stock was down just under 1% during morning trading.\n\n\"Given the state of the business and the leadership team, now is an appropriate moment for me to make this transition, and to take the opportunity to spend more time with family for a while, recharge a bit, and create some mental free space to reflect and consider the possibilities,\" Selipsky said. He took over AWS in 2021.\n\nSelipsky, whose three-year tenure was defined by the pandemic, oversaw the business as companies were reeling from the disruptions of the public health crisis and pulled back from spending. But the cloud division has since posted swelling sales growth.\n\nLast quarter revenue for AWS came in at $25 billion, beating analyst expectations and increasing about 17% compared to the same period last year. Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Adam Selipsky delivers a keynote address on November 28, 2023, in Las Vegas. (Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) (Noah Berger via Getty Images)\n\n\"I’d like to thank Adam for everything he’s done to lead AWS over the past three years. He took over in the middle of the pandemic, which presented a wide array of leadership and business challenges,\" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a note to employees Tuesday.\n\nGarman has worked at Amazon for nearly 18 years, starting as an MBA intern in 2005 and becoming one of the first AWS product managers. He’d go on to serve in the same division as general manager of all AWS compute services and later as the head of sales and marketing. His career tracks the development of AWS, which has grown to become the company’s most profitable unit. That Amazon would appoint an AWS veteran to lead the key division highlights the importance of the role and the pivotal moment for the company.\n\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is among the tech giants racing to claim market share and launch new consumer services, largely based around its major cloud services business. Earlier this year, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, committing another $2.75 billion to bring its investment total to $4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Another streaming bundle: Comcast's Peacock to partner with Netflix, Apple TV+",
        "content": "Consumers will soon have access to yet another streaming bundle. Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\n\nThe new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference.\n\n\"Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,\" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date.\n\n\"We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,\" he added. \"This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.\"\n\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\nOn average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time.\n\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.\n\nDisney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year.\n\nThe move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently.\n\nJust last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS) announced a new streaming bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US.\n\nEarlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall. And in December, WBD partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon (VZ).\n\nStory continues The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York on July 1, 2015.

        "content": "The stock market rebounded last week, igniting hopes of a sustained rally. However, in contrast to the previous AI-powered rally, the spotlight is now on recession-proof stocks. In this scenario, wagering on cloud computing stocks to buy on the dip will likely result in robust upside.\n\nCloud computing has become a mission-critical service for businesses over the years. The technology enables companies to store vast amounts of data, increase productivity, and save a ton of money. Moreover, with the generative AI revolution in full motion, the significance of cloud computing companies becomes even more pronounced. Cloud computing firms provide the sturdy infrastructure necessary to operate AI applications. Here are the cloud computing stocks to buy:\n\nCloud Computing Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud computing arm in Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a revelation for its business. To put things in perspective, AWS generated $3.1 billion in 2013 to a dumbfounding $90.76 billion last year. Moreover, over the past several years, AWS has been arguably the fastest-growing segment for Amazon. Even in its most recent quarter, AWS revenues surged 17% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis, outpacing Amazon’s overall 13% growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAI’s been huge for AWS, turbocharging the segment’s output and injecting new vitality into its operations. Not only has it resulted in an amazing influx of new customers, but it’s also providing existing customers with additional incentives to upgrade their accounts. Looking ahead, you can bet the house that AI will continue to be a major growth catalyst for AWS.\n\nAmazon recently invested another $2.5 billion in AI startup Anthropic, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic currently leverages the power of AWS for its generative AI services and specialized chips.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another giant in the cloud computing realm, with a 25% market share in the niche. Like Amazon, Microsoft’s Azure has become a key growth engine for the company, solidifying its position as the second-largest cloud computing service after AWS.  Revenues from Azure have ballooned from $880 million in 2015 to upwards of $68 million last year.\n\nOver the years, Azure has carved out a substantial slice of Microsoft’s revenue pie. For instance, in its most recent quarterly results, sales have jumped 23% YOY to $35.1 billion. That’s more than 50% of the company’s sales generated during the quarter. These lofty numbers have plenty to do with the tech giant’s investments in AI and its spill-over effects on its software stack.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Azure offers multiple benefits over AWS, making it a highly attractive option for many enterprises worldwide. Azure is more cost-efficient for companies, especially those using Windows and SQL Servers. Moreover, thanks to its efficient integration capabilities, especially in hybrid cloud environments​​​​, you’ve got access to the company’s timeless software suite. Hence, it’s safe to say that Azure will continue driving a major chunk of MSFT’s future sales while catalyzing future stock price action.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) provides cloud-based data warehousing solutions, positioning itself as a juggernaut in its niche. It has operated a hyper-growth business, boasting a 5-year average revenue growth rate of 107%. Despite the normalization of pandemic-led tailwinds, analysts expect the company to continue growing by double-digit margins for the foreseeable future.\n\nAI and machine learning will likely play a critical role in ushering in the next growth phase for its business. The firm’s investments in AI technology should help it capitalize on the growing demand for cloud-based data solutions. The technology effectively reshapes its cloud services through the Snowflake Cortex and partnerships with AI giants such as Nvidia. Cortex uses large language models (LLMs) to streamline the development of AI applications for users of all skill levels.\n\nCortex is not the only AI-powered service. Its Container Services enable customized user interfaces for AI apps within its ecosystem. These forward-looking efforts underscore Snowflake’s focus on making AI more accessible, positioning it for spectacular gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "From Science Fiction to Reality: 3 Robotics Stocks for Automatic Riches",
        "content": "Robotics stocks should be a leading investment theme throughout the 2020s. The concept of automating factories, warehouses and data entry work has long appealed to large corporations. Increasingly, the tools are ready for primetime and investors can stand to benefit.\n\nAdding to that, artificial intelligence has taken off in recent years. Now, these sophisticated automation systems can be paired with AI engines.\n\nAdmittedly, there’s a bit of a blurry line around the exact definition of a robotics stock today. Take a leading sector exchange-traded fund, the $2.7 billion Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ), for example. It prominently features both robotics and AI within its fund.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile these may seem like different investment themes, there is a chicken and egg question. What good is a robot that doesn’t have some form of AI to help direct its actions? Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, also has more utility when paired with a physical entity.\n\nAll this to say that there’s a wide range of companies that can fit within the concept of robotics stocks. These are three robotics leaders covering different niches within the space, helping with factory automation to software robots and other tasks.\n\nColumbus McKinnon (CMCO) stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes D\n\nSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com\n\nColumbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) offers one of the most compelling ways to ride the automation wave. That’s because Columbus McKinnon is a leader in automation and robotics solutions for warehouses. Notably, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested heavily in warehouse robotics, giving it a huge lead in e-commerce fulfillment, and now the rest of the retail industry is scrambling to catch up.\n\nThis should give Columbus McKinnon many opportunities for growth over the next decade. The company is a leader in making the physical tools necessary for building a 21st century automated warehouse. Think of items such as conveyor belts, hoists, rigging tools and motion-control systems.\n\nGiven the surge in labor costs since the pandemic, companies are willing to spend heavily on labor-saving solutions. It’s not just warehouses, either. With the reshoring phenomenon and renewed interest in North American manufacturing, a new wave of smart factories will utilize Columbus McKinnon’s automation solutions for industrial purposes as well. This has caused the share to go up about 27% in the past year.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a company that finds itself right at the crossroads of automation and AI. The firm is a leader in robotic process automation, which is a toolset that helps company automate routine tasks.\n\nStory continues\n\nEssentially, the idea is that UiPath’s platform offers clients an easy-to-use way to set up, operate and manage software robots that can effectively mimic basic human activities. These could cover areas such as data entry, invoice processing and e-mail management, among others.\n\nBasically, RPA systems help employees manage repetitive tasks, allowing human workers to spend more time on higher value-added activities.\n\nThe rise of generative AI has made some people think these sort of automation functions can spring up overnight. But in practice, these types of software tools tend to be iterative and get a little better with each and every year.\n\nUiPath was founded back in 2005, giving it almost two decades of experience in the RPA field. This gives it a huge head start against the newer field of emerging automation-focused AI rivals.\n\nFor its already-concluded fiscal year 2024, UiPath generated more than $1.3 billion in revenues and analysts see more growth from here. The company also just reached profitability, putting it ahead of many rivals.\n\nProcept BioRobotics (PRCT) stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buy. Healthcare Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nProcept BioRobotics (NASDAQ:PRCT) is a health care equipment company focused on robotic surgical systems.\n\nThis is an attractive market for the robotics and automation space. Computer-aided surgical tools can offer greater precision for certain types of procedures, while also enabling remote medicine in cases where an on-site human surgeon may not be physically available.\n\nFor Procept specifically, it manufactures and services the AquaBeam Robotic System. The AquaBeam is an image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive urologic surgery that primarily treats benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nProcept gained Food and Drug Administration clearance to launch the AquaBeam in 2017. Business has scaled up quickly, with revenues soaring from $6 million in 2019 to $136 million last year. Analysts expect $214 million in revenues for 2024, which would make for a compelling 57% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nProcept isn’t yet profitable, and that might scare some investors off. However, a proven next-generation surgical system with rapidly scaling revenues should generate a great deal of shareholder value, either for Procept directly, or via an acquisition by a larger medical devices company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in CMCO stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

        "title": "Monopoly Definition and 12 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will go over the definition of a monopoly and take a look at the 12 near-monopoly stocks in the US. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nA monopoly is characterized by a single seller holding sway over a market, offering a singular product. In its truest sense, a monopoly commands a 100% market share. Many sectors are governed by key players with substantial market dominance. These companies benefit from economies of scale and erect barriers to entry, thwarting potential newcomers from challenging their dominance. In our previous examination of near-monopoly stocks, we referenced Warren Buffett's 2011 testimony before the US Congress, in which he highlighted pricing power as a crucial factor in assessing a business. Buffett, one of the most renowned investors globally, has amassed billions through his publicly traded holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). With an impressive investment history and personal wealth, Buffett has sought out consumer monopolies whose products possess unique qualities such as patents, brand names, or other intangibles that effectively deter competition.\n\nIt's worth noting that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) holds the largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, valued at over $174.34 billion as of Q4 2023. The tech giant's dominance extends to several industries, either through outright monopoly or near-monopoly positions. Additionally, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks as the third-largest investment in Warren Buffett's portfolio. Headquartered in New York, the company offers credit and debit card services, alongside Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).\n\nOverall, the financial media has been abuzz with discussions about the significant portion of the stock market surge in 2023 attributed to only seven companies, nicknamed the \"Magnificent 7.\" These select companies represent over 30% of the total value of the S&P 500, despite making up just 1.6% of the index, and contributed over 60% to the overall market gain in 2023. Excluding them, the stock market's increase last year would have been a modest 9% after adjusting for inflation. When examining profits, it's evident why. According to Deutsche Bank macro strategist Jim Reid, the Magnificent 7 generates approximately $361 billion annually. This amount is comparable to the combined profits of all companies in Japan and notably surpasses the total profits of all listed companies in the UK, which roughly amount to $217 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn theory, a monopoly might not seem problematic, but by definition, it could harm consumers if not closely regulated. Without competition, monopolies may charge excessive prices, offer subpar products, and limit choices to maximize their profits. While not outright banned by law, various regulations exist to ensure monopolies engage in fair practices. The Sherman Antitrust Act, for example, is a key legislation used to break up companies that stifle competition and prevent mergers that could create virtual monopolies. Another example comes in the form of lawsuits, whereby which governments aim to prevent anticompetitive practices in a market. The most recent one involved the US Department of Justice and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Earlier in March, the Justice Department, alongside over a dozen state attorneys general, lodged a lawsuit in the US District Court in New Jersey targeting the tech behemoth. Alleging anticompetitive behavior in the smartphone market, this move signifies another step in the Biden Administration's campaign to rein in the influence of Big Tech, and follows previous antitrust actions directed at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHowever, despite these regulations potentially limiting profits, investors often find monopolistic stocks attractive. The significant market share held by monopolies can contribute to long-term growth and value, offsetting some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have solidified their position by dominating a sector and securing a significant market share are often considered among the best near monopoly stocks in their respective industries. Monopoly Definition and 12 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US\n\nNorthfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we've pinpointed 12 US stocks that demonstrate near-monopoly characteristics, largely driven by their significant market share. Many of these companies belong to the FAANG cohort, comprising major players in the technology sphere. These tech giants dominate various sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile applications, operating systems, search engines, social media, and web browsers. Additionally, other stocks in our selection command near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors like alcoholic beverages, personal credit rating, and satellite radio.

Before we get into the details of why we started a position in Altria, a brief history is in order. The company was formerly known as Philip Morris before rebranding to Altria in 2003. Cynically, the rebranding was to minimize the negative attention from its tobacco business. However, the company also owned Kraft Foods and Miller Brewing, so it was logical to reflect its status as a conglomerate. Since rebranding, Altria has slowly “de-conglomerated”. It spun out Kraft in 2007. It spun out Philip Morris International in 2008. In 2021, it sold its Ste. Michelle Wine Estates business. Finally, last month Altria announced it is selling part of its 10% ownership in Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)\n\nAndvari has followed Altria since we began our investment career. Profitability is extraordinary and the business requires minimal capital expenditures. Despite the volume of cigarettes having steadily declined—a great thing for our population health—Altria has still managed to grow revenues and profits with regular price increases…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n8.

        "content": "Investors interested in Internet - Commerce stocks are likely familiar with Amazon (AMZN) and Coupang, Inc. (CPNG). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nAmazon has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Coupang, Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AMZN is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nAMZN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 41.29, while CPNG has a forward P/E of 66.18. We also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.39. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CPNG currently has a PEG ratio of 40.35.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for AMZN is its P/B ratio of 9.01. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CPNG has a P/B of 9.88.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help AMZN earn a Value grade of B, while CPNG has been given a Value grade of C.\n\nAMZN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that AMZN is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on a hot streak, rising each of the first nine days of May. According to Barron’s, only three of the index’s 30 components — Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) — dropped in that time. Meanwhile, Amgen (NYSE:AMGN), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have all been on hot streaks in May. Conversely, 80% of the S&P 500 rose during the same time frame. Some of its key components, including CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), have tumbled more than 10% in May. It appears that investors are starting to grow less thrilled with technology and AI for the time being. That trend is beneficial for the Dow, which is much less tech-oriented than the S&P 500. Specifically, 30% of the S&P 500’s components are in the tech sector versus only 19% of Dow stocks. For investors wanting to exploit the Dow’s new-found strength, here are the three best Dow stocks to buy in May.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is clearly continuing to benefit significantly from the strength of the upper-middle class and wealthy consumers. Adobe Analytics recently reported that online retail spending in America jumped 7% in the first four months of the year.\n\nSo it’s unsurprising that in the first quarter, American Express’ EPS soared 27% YOY to $3.33. Meanwhile, its top line advanced 12% YOY to $15.8 billion. Given the large increase of the company’s bottom line, its forward price-earnings ratio of 18.6 times is quite attractive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll of these factors make American Express one of the best Dow stocks to buy in May.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is getting a big lift from the improvements of the stock, credit and IPO markets, along with increased M&A activity. The firm will likely get a boost from the Fed’s determination to cut interest rates, as this will benefit nearly all of its operating markets.\n\nAs of last month, GS stock has been identified as one of the top American equities by Bank of America. Additionally, Argus raised its rating on the shares to “Buy,” citing the rejuvenation of the firm’s investment banking business. Argus expects Goldman’s investment banking unit to continue to deliver strong returns going forward. The huge investment bank’s underwriting business expanded last quarter, while M&A activity jumped nearly 20% last quarter industrywide YOY.\n\nIndicating that the Street is warming up to GS stock, the shares have climbed almost 17% in the last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmgen (AMGN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmgen CEO Robert Bradway recently reported that he was encouraged by the interim results of a Phase 2 trial of the company’s weight-loss drug, MariTide. Bradway noted that he was confident that the treatment would help patients. The firm did not release any Phase 2 data on the drug, but it’s expected to do so later this year. Some evidence indicates that MariTide helps patients keep weight off even after discontinuing the drug. That would be an important, key differentiator for MariTide compared to competing treatments. Additionally, MariTide is administered monthly, while the leading, currently available weight-loss drugs have to be taken weekly.\n\nInvestment bank William Blair upgraded Amgen to “Outperform” in the wake of the news. The bank thinks the drug can be a multi-blockbuster and believes that it can reduce patients’ weight by 20% or more.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held GS bonds and long positions in INTC and AMZN.

        "title": "30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the top 6 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US.\n\nQuality education undoubtedly sets a person up for success. According to a Fortune500 report, 75% of the world's top 20 CEOs held an MBA or other graduate degree in 2023, 100% of the top 20 held an undergraduate degree, and 11.8% of the top 100 CEOs in the world in 2023 attended undergrad programs from IVY institutes. For context, the IVY League is a group of  8 private universities in the US, renowned worldwide for their history, academic excellence, and exclusivity. It's also interesting to note that although all eight of these institutions are classified among the most prestigious colleges in the world, they do not typically define quality.\n\nAre The Hardest Colleges to Get Into Also The Best Ones?\n\nThe quality and worth of an institution can be judged through different metrics like alumni salary, graduation and retention rates, net costs, academic success, etc. However, a low acceptance rate – or exclusivity – does not directly equate to quality. At the same time, the acceptance rate and the measure of quality or economic value of a college are closely linked. That’s because the hardest colleges academically to get into often excel in all the quality metrics and provide a better ROI than inclusive universities.\n\nFor example, the #1 college in the US by worth is extremely selective, and fresh graduates from this institute can make approximately over $110,000. In comparison, a graduate from any American university with a 100% acceptance rate would make less than half of the same amount. In fact, graduates from top colleges dominated the list of highest-paying bachelor’s degrees as of 2023. Put simply, some of the best colleges in the US which produce the most highly-qualified graduates have high competition and low acceptance rates. Therefore, although exclusivity is not a direct measure of an institute's economic value for students, it is an indirect one.\n\nIn the US, there is a wide variety of colleges in terms of inclusivity. Some colleges allow everyone to get in, others accept in moderation, and some tend to be extremely selective. Similar to acceptance rate diversity, tuition fees also vary depending on the exclusivity and inclusivity of a college (See: 15 Cheapest American Universities with Low Tuition for International Students).\n\nGenerally, though, college tuition is costly in the US, with most students having to spend years after graduating trying to pay off their debts. With an average annual tuition fee of $27,091, the US has the highest cost of education in the world. According to the Federal Reserve report, student debt was over $1.7 trillion by the end of 2023. Compared to 2022, this is a decrease of $36.9 billion. However, compared to 2019, the debt grew by $89.3 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe high student debt is a result of the high cost of education in the US, which in turn, affects the accessibility of quality higher education to many individuals in the US. For this reason, some multinational companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), and Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) are making an effort to help their employees pay for college through tuition reimbursement.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has committed to invest a total of $1.2 billion by 2025 in its Career Choice, which is an employees' education and skills training benefits program. In this program, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers funding for college tuition, high school diplomas, GEDs, and English as a Second Language (ESL) proficiency certifications for more than 750,000 front-line employees in the US. Through its Career Choice program, the company aims to support its employees in getting over the biggest barriers to education – time and money.\n\nMeanwhile, Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), an American multinational insurance company, offers to cover up to $5,250 in pre-approved education expenses per calendar year as tuition assistance for its employees. The coverage includes tuition, course fees, textbooks, registration fees, lab fees, and any cost related to the job or career path-related course. Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) also offers tuition-free professional certificate and boot camp programs through its Guild Education plan.\n\nOn the other hand, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX), an American multinational healthcare corporation, supports education by offering scholarships for undergraduate studies. The scholarships are on a merit basis and only available for children of Baxter International Inc.’s (NYSE:BAX) employees.\n\nBelow, we list the top hardest colleges to get into in the US. 30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US\n\n30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor the list of the 30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US, we used the College Navigator by the National Center of Education Statistics to browse through their directory of 7,000 colleges and universities in the United States and shortlist a pool of the top 42 colleges with less than 15% acceptance rates.\n\nWe then obtained the acceptance rates and number of undergraduate applicants for each college, and assigned weights to both these metrics. A weight of 30% was assigned to the acceptance rate as this demonstrates exclusivity and a weight of 70% was assigned to the number of applicants as this demonstrates competition. Once we had assigned weights, we normalized our data to ensure that both metrics contributed equally to our final ranking, and then calculated the composite score. Our final metric represented the exclusivity of each college. For the final step, we ranked the colleges based on this metric. The list is ranked in ascending order, going up to the hardest college to get into in the US. Note that the data we have used is as recent as the one provided by NCES (Fall 2022).\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

It was founded in 1813 and is located in Waterville, Maine. Colby is one of the hardest colleges to get into in the US because of its low acceptance rates and large applicant pool.

        "content": "Alibaba Backs China's AI Startups with Cloud Credits, Eyeing Leadership in Global AI Race\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) uses its cloud computing resources to support China’s generative AI start-ups, providing them with credits instead of traditional cash-for-equity investments.\n\nThe strategy aims to establish the e-commerce giant as a leader in the AI sector, similar to Microsoft Corp’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) approach with OpenAI, the Financial Times reports.\n\nThe company has invested in several prominent start-ups, such as Moonshot, Zhipu, MiniMax, and 01.ai, developing local versions of popular U.S. applications like ChatGPT.\n\nAlso Read: Alibaba’s To Overhaul Taobao In Strategic Move to Reclaim E-commerce Dominance\n\nDespite sluggish growth since Beijing’s crackdown on large internet firms, Alibaba’s cloud arm is seeking new revenue by offering its computing resources to train AI models.\n\nThis investment strategy mirrors those of Microsoft and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), where funds are used to support operations on specific cloud servers.\n\nHowever, unlike these U.S. companies, Alibaba retains the funds in an escrow account, treating them as incoming revenue. This computing-for-equity approach is precious in China, where cloud resources are scarce due to U.S. export restrictions on advanced chips.\n\nAlibaba’s commitment to AI extends to monetizing its inventory of AI chips, which includes significant orders of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs stored in data centers across China and Southeast Asia. Earlier Alibaba chief Joe Tsai had flagged how China lagged behind in AI race due to US tech embargo.\n\nLast week, Alibaba launched the latest version of its large language model, Qwen2.5, which it claimed to beat OpenAI’s GPT-4 in language skills.\n\nAlibaba stock lost over 9% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Why \"Sell in May?\" Instead, Buy These 5 Growth Stocks Now",
        "content": "Wall Street’s age-old adage “sell in May and go away” highlights that the summer months between May and October is the worst period for investors to put money in the stock market. Especially after an outstanding winter, it’s hard to digest that there won't be any profit-taking in the weaker summer months.\n\nBut astute investors shouldn’t completely unload stocks because of seasonal trends. This is because 2024 is a presidential election year, and stocks tend to perform better in the months leading up to the election compared to nonelection years. By the way, the stock market has already defied the sell-in-May trend, with all the major indexes trading in the positive territory for the month.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average scaled upward for the eighth successive trading session on May 10 and registered its best week since December. The 30-stock index posted a fourth consecutive winning week and is now tantalizingly close to the coveted 40,000 mark. The broader S&P 500 and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite also recorded their third positive week (read more: Dow's 40,000 on the Way: 3 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now).\n\nThe stock market, in reality, is well-poised to gain traction as the Federal Reserve has ruled out any interest rate hike in the upcoming policy meetings. To top it, despite sticky inflation, the cooling of the labor market raised hopes of interest rate cuts soon. New job additions were the lowest in April since November and the unemployment rate is hovering near the 4% mark. Wage growth, on the other hand, declined to its lowest level in April in three years.\n\nThus, consumers’ intent to spend will decline amid fewer jobs and weaker wage growth, which should curb price pressures. The Fed, in turn, will be compelled to trim interest rates. This will lead to a decline in the cost of borrowing and boost consumer outlays.\n\nHence, with the economy well-positioned to chug along and the stock market set to defy discouraging seasonal factors, investors should place bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks such as Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Hess Corporation HES for solid returns.\n\nThese stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines is a gold producer having exploration activities in Canada, Europe, Latin America and the United States. Agnico Eagle Mines presently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 39.7% over the past 60 days. AEM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 42.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch operates as a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women and kids. Abercrombie & Fitch currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 3.2% over the past 60 days. ANF’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 20.1%.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 11.8% over the past 60 days. AMZN’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 56.6%.\n\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age.

        "title": "Top 3 Blue-Chip Picks as Dow Posts an Eight-Day Winning Run",
        "content": "U.S. stock markets regained momentum in May after a disappointing April. The 15-month impressive bull run of Wall Street ended last month. The Dow, despite participating in the bull run, always a lagged to its peers — the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nHowever, things have taken a different turn in May. Month to date, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 3.7% and 5%, respectively. The Dow is also up 4.5% in the same period. On May 10, the Dow — popularly known as Wall Street’s blue-chip index — posted an eight-day winning streak, for the first time since Dec 15, 2023.\n\nFor the week ended May 10, the Dow gained 2.25, marking its best week so far this year and the fourth positive week in a row. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both posted the third consecutive winning week, rising 1.9% and 1.2%, respectively.\n\nDow Likely to Gather Momentum\n\nThe Dow recorded its all-time high of 39,889.05 on an intraday basis on Mar 21 and 39,807.37 on a closing basis on Mar 28. Technically, at its current level of 39,512.84, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 38,748.71 and 36,503.03, respectively.\n\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nRecent Restructuring of Dow\n\nOn Feb 26, the restructuring of the 30-stock index resulted in the exit of medical retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) and the entry of the e-commerce super giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nThe inclusion of Amazon is seen as a strategic move to increase the blue-chip index’s exposure to new-economy stocks. Broadly, Amazon is categorized as a consumer discretionary company.\n\nHowever, its massive adoption of high-end technologies compelled a large section of financial analysts to categorize it as a technology bigwig. Amazon’s entry will significantly increase the exposure of the blue-chip index in the e-commerce, consumer retail and technology space.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to three Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our three picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN in gaining momentum among customers.\n\nAMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other positives. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 56.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nsalesforce.com inc. CRM is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. CRM’s sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line. Continued deal wins in the international market are also growth catalysts.\n\nThe buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved CRM’s competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. CRM’s strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings will help it tap the growing opportunities in the space.\n\nsalesforce.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.8% and 18.1%, respectively, for the current year (January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 60 days.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

AMZN, Visa Inc. V, Pfizer Inc. PFE, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. ZBH.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Amazon, Visa and Pfizer\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Visa Inc. and Pfizer Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Amazon have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+24.7% vs. +17.2%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance.\r\n\r\nUltrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Additionally, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nVisa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the year-to-date period (+7.6% vs. +5.4%). The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. It expects net revenues to increase in low double digits for fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nVisa, fueled by increased payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth. It reported strong fiscal 2Q24 results. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance.\r\n\r\nA robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challengesIt is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Pfizer have gained +0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +14.9%. The company beat first-quarter estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Pfizer’s top line is declining due to a steep drop in revenues from its COVID-19 products, the Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, due to lower demand.\r\n\r\nConcerns remain about its long-term growth drivers. Nonetheless, Pfizer expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the future quarters, driven by its in-line products like Vyndaqel and Prevnar, new launches like Abrysvo, Velsipity, Penbraya and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen.\r\n\r\nHuge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position. The funds are being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Pfizer here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Stocks Driving the Dow's Market-Beating Performance\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average emerged stronger than the other two major indices in the latest market rally, driven by renewed hopes of rate cuts, solid corporate earnings and increased stock buybacks. The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year.\n\nWhile 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen, Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Boeing and The Goldman Sachs Group.\n\nThe outperformance came as the market’s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer.\n\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\n\nThe blue-chip index also benefited from Apple’s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\n\nAnother big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index.\n\nFurther, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nAmgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets. The stock has risen 14.5% so far this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmgen saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It jumped nearly 9% over the past seven days and saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year in the same time frame.\n\nAMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nApple designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories worldwide. The company offers iPhone, a line of smartphones, Mac, a line of personal computers, iPad, a line of multi-purpose tablets, and wearables, home, and accessories comprising AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products and HomePod. Shares of AAPL are up 8% so far this month.\n\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending September 2024) with an estimated earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nBoeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades. The company’s premier jet aircraft along with varied defense products position it as one of the largest defense contractors in the United States. It has a solid estimated earnings growth of 95.9% for this year.\n\nBoeing has risen 8% so far this month. It has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. It has risen 6.8% so far this month.\n\nGoldman saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 71 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 60.8%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 currently.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 13, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT, Home Depot HD and Amazon AMZN.\n\nRetail Earnings Loom: What to Expect\n\nWalmart shares held their own in last month’s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target and Home Depot.\n\nFrom the market’s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%.\n\nWalmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th.\n\nTarget shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management’s ability on the margins and the ‘shrinkage issue’ they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years. Home Depot is a housing play and, as such, remains exposed to the seemingly higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 21 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 21 retailers that have reported are up +54.5% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 57.1% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe online players and restaurant operators have struggled to exceed EPS and revenue estimates in Q1. In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.\n\nWith respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 21 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 460 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 10th. We have almost 400 companies reporting results this week, including 7 S&P 500 members. In addition to Walmart and Home Depot, this week’s line-up includes Cisco Systems, Deere & Company, China’s Alibaba, JD.com, and many others.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 460 index members are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context.\n\nEarnings growth for these companies would have been +7.9% instead of +4.8% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.\n\nAs we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been on the weaker side for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -1%, while the growth pace improves to +8.9% on an ex-energy basis.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9.2% on +4.5% higher revenues.\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% on +1.5% revenue growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Growth Poised to Accelerate\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Software Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "U.S. equities, especially undervalued software stocks, appear to be in rally mode. As of the end of Wednesday’s trading session, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has risen 2.37 percentage points in the last month. Meanwhile, its counterpart the S&P500 has appreciated 3.18 percent. This comes after both indices suffered significant losses during the month of April, forcing equities investors and traders to question whether or not U.S. equities would be able to sustain a rally throughout 2024. The macroeconomic environment remains to be a key pain point for the market, and market participants should expect more volatility in the coming weeks.\n\nNevertheless, rising stock prices implies higher valuations. To help investors look for cheaper investments, below is a list of three of the most undervalued software stocks in the space these days.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re giving or receiving payments, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is already an established name for you. Founded in 1998, the payments platform boasts more than 400 million active accounts and offers a variety of payment services tailored for different kinds of merchants.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn early February, PayPal announced its fourth quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2023. The payments platform beat analyst estimates on revenue, earnings per share, and total payments volume. Revenue came in at $8 billion for the quarter and $29.8 billion for the full year. Both of which represent year-over-year growth in the high single digits. GAAP EPS figures for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year were $1.29 per share and $3.84 per share, respectively. PayPal was able to deliver strong earnings growth off the back of various organization costs cuts. Moreover, with PayPal’s Q1 2024 earnings print the company boosted its profit outlook for the year.\n\nThe payments platform trades at 15.5x forward earnings, and PayPal’s plans to revive its branded checkout business could create secular tailwinds for the business while also providing investors with multiple expansion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of internet giant Google, will be the only tech giant to make this list. The tech firm’s dominance in search is very well-known at this point. However, growth prospects in areas of both cloud computing and artificial intelligence coupled with its relatively low trading multiple make Alphabet one of the undervalued software stocks currently for sale.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite worries about Google Cloud and is competitive strengths with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Google’s cloud platform continues to be a robust engine of growth for the software giant. For Alphabet’s fourth quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2023, Google Cloud revenue increased 26% year-over-year. Additionally, in the company’s first quarter earnings print for fiscal year 2024, Google Cloud increased revenues by 18% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income for Google Cloud quadrupled from $191 million in Q1 2023 to $900 million in Q1 2024.\n\nThe announcement of the software firm’s first dividend also elated investors. As the company continues to grow in cloud and AI, while also keeping costs down, investors should find themselves quite pleased. Alphabet trades at 21.9x forward earnings, which is less than competitors like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nTrimble (TRMB) The Trimble (TRMB) headquarters in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) is a software platform working to bring digital transformation to the construction and infrastructure industries. The company’s software helps to with everything from project design and visualization to digital monitoring of equipment and real assets. The infrastructure and construction spaces are some of the most underserved sectors into terms of technology penetration, which makes the opportunity to help digitize these industries immense. Furthermore, the $1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill passed some years ago still has funded ready to be allocated, and this will help to provide secular growth tailwinds for Trimble for years to come.\n\nIn their recent quarterly earnings report for fiscal year 2024, Trimble was able to beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings per share. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $953.3 million, while annualized recurring revenue ballooned to $2 billion, up 23% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nTrimble trades at 19.7x forward earnings, which is not very cheap, but given the opportunity in the space in which Trimble operates, the company’s growth prospects are solid.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "TV upfront presentations clouded by digital video ad supremacy",
        "content": "By Dawn Chmielewski and Sheila Dang\n\n(Reuters) - As television executives prepare lavish stage presentations in New York this week to dazzle advertisers during the annual TV upfront sales season, a harsh economic reality looms offstage -- digital video advertising now eclipses spending on traditional television ads.\n\nThe shift in spending and competition from tech players like Amazon has taken a toll on media companies' financial results, raising the stakes for the annual showcase of TV content to attract spending commitments from advertisers.\n\n“We’ve definitely seen that audience erosion in linear TV in certain pockets -- especially more so in entertainment,” said Nicole McCurnin, director of advertising insights at ad tracking firm Guideline. “But I do see, broad strokes, ad companies’ attention is just going more so towards those digital platforms.”\n\nDigital video refers to a broad category of TV alternatives that includes paid streaming services like Netflix, social video platforms such as TikTok, free ad-supported TV offerings like Pluto TV and cable replacement services including YouTube TV. It will account for an estimated $62.9 billion in U.S. ad spending in 2024, according to an April report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and Guideline.\n\nThat represents 52% of the projected spending on video advertising this year, reflecting a change in viewing habits nearly two decades in the making.\n\nWalt Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Fox and Comcast's NBCUniversal all reported declines in domestic television ad revenue in the most recent quarter, though NBCU's exclusive streaming of an NFL Wild Card game on its Peacock service helped fuel revenue, offsetting those declines.\n\nMany of the streaming services launched to capitalize on changing consumer viewing behavior \"are still bleeding cash while declines in the traditional television business accelerate,\" said Richard Greenfield, media analyst at LightShed Partners. \"They simply pivoted too late.\"\n\nThe fragmenting of the video landscape is well understood -- and media companies like NBCUniversal have developed new advertising tools that let marketers' messages ride along with their content, wherever it appears. For example, a T-Mobile ad featuring U.S. TV show \"Saturday Night Live's\" Chloe Fineman could air during the live network TV broadcast of “SNL,” appear the next day on NBCU’s Peacock streaming service and show up on social platforms like X, TikTok and YouTube.\n\n“Regardless of where that person is who's in your target … you can go follow them, wherever they are,” NBCUniversal global advertising chairman Mark Marshall told Reuters. “The technology and capability just wasn't available until this year.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of the upfront advertiser presentations, Disney and Warner Bros Discovery announced they would combine their Disney+, Hulu and Max streaming services this summer in a bundle of programming reminiscent of cable television. Such a combination might reduce subscriber cancellations and perhaps coax money-losing competitors to follow suit, analysts said.\n\n“We view a re-bundling of traditional media content on streaming platforms as a key to making the space investable again,” wrote TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz.\n\nMeanwhile, digital rivals Amazon and Netflix are hosting their own advertiser presentations in New York -- the Seattle retail giant, for the first time -- to capture shifting ad dollars.\n\nAmazon launched ads within Prime Video for all customers in January, requiring users to pay for a higher-priced tier to remove ads. The move will boost Amazon's revenue and likely come at the expense of traditional TV companies' revenue, said Brian Wieser, a longtime ad industry analyst, in a March report.\n\nMedia companies are also tying up with tech giants to sell more ads. During a presentation to advertisers last month, Google announced that brands would be able to buy ad space with media companies like Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery through Google's automated tech tools, rather than working with salespeople.\n\n\"I think we're going to hear more about programmatic ... particularly as consumption shifts to the digital and streaming ecosystem,” said Samantha Rose, strategic investment lead at Horizon Media, referring to the upfront presentations.\n\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, Sheila Dang in Austin; Edited by Kenneth Li in New York)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Just Made a Once-in-a-Generation Bet on This Stock. Time to Buy?",
        "content": "When Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive officer of Citadel, makes an investment decision, everyone stands up and takes notice. That's because this investing giant has produced show-stopping results over time, with Citadel bringing in about $74 billion in returns since its 1990 launch. That makes it the most successful hedge fund ever.\n\nSo it's no surprise investors are eager to hear about Griffin's latest moves. This superstar investor holds more than 4,000 stocks and funds in the Citadel portfolio, and more than 19% of the portfolio is made up of technology stocks. Clearly, Griffin believes in the potential of some of today's biggest tech companies. And that leads me to one of his latest moves.\n\nGriffin increased his position in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) by more than 200% in the fourth quarter, buying more than 4 million shares to lift his holding to about 6.2 million. Thanks to Amazon's dominance in the two high-growth industries of e-commerce and cloud computing and the company's strategy to win in the artificial intelligence (AI) market, this looks like a once-in-a-generation bet. Is it one you should follow? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon's track record\n\nFirst, before we even get to the much-talked-about area of AI, we'll talk about Amazon's track record. The company has progressively added to its e-commerce and cloud computing services, and this has translated into billion-dollar sales and profit. Amazon has even demonstrated its ability to manage a difficult high-interest rate environment. As higher rates and general economic pressure weighed on demand for discretionary items and cloud services, the company revamped its cost structure, focused on efficiency -- and went on to shift from a rare annual loss to profit last year. AMZN Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nThese efforts should help Amazon continue to control costs and increase revenue. For example, the move to a regional fulfillment model from a national one -- bringing inventory closer to the customer -- has decreased Amazon's cost to serve.\n\nNow, Amazon's focus on AI across its businesses may supercharge this already solid growth story. Amazon represents a unique AI bet because the company uses the technology to improve its operations, and therefore lower costs and better serve customers -- and through Amazon Web Services (AWS), it sells AI products and services to customers. So Amazon is benefiting from AI in two ways.\n\nIn e-commerce, for example, Amazon uses AI to determine the best delivery routes, a key step in making deliveries cheaper and faster. This pleases Amazon and its customers. And Amazon uses AI in many other ways across the fulfillment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom chips to Amazon Bedrock\n\nBut AWS may be where Amazon is set to score the biggest AI victory. AWS delivered $25 billion in sales this past quarter, for a $100 billion annualized run rate, and this is thanks to the cloud provider's strengths in AI. Amazon, through AWS, offers customers AI solutions to meet all of their needs from a broad range of chips to a fully managed service called Amazon Bedrock that allows customers to customize top large language models for their own purposes.\n\nAnd Amazon offers a range of AI-powered apps across its e-commerce and cloud businesses to help customers with everything from shopping to coding.\n\nOne reason I believe AWS could be among the biggest players in AI over time is that it's the world's leading cloud provider by far -- and this means potential customers already are right there, ready to turn to AWS for their AI needs too. Since Amazon has built a vast selection of AI products and services corresponding to the needs of both cost-conscious customers and those with significant budgets, it's ready to deliver.\n\nShould you follow Ken Griffin's move?\n\nConsidering the increase in Ken Griffin's Amazon investment and his presence in AI tech stocks, he clearly sees this potential. So, should you follow this billionaire investor into Amazon right now?\n\nA look at Amazon's valuation shows it's trading for 41x forward earnings estimates. That's lower than levels approaching 60 late last year. At the same time, sales are on the rise at the company, and AWS has seen customers emerge from a period of cost cutting and start deploying new projects. So a new wave of growth may just be getting started, and that makes the shares look pretty reasonable at today's level.\n\nAnd it's important to remember the general AI growth story is just getting started too, with the market forecast to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nAll of this means, right now, Amazon looks like a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity -- not only for billionaire Ken Griffin but possibly for you too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Ultimate Growth Stock to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Just like it does a wonderful job taking care of its customers, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to cater to its shareholders as well. The tech titan reported first-quarter 2024 revenue and earnings per share that exceeded Wall Street estimates. This helped propel shares higher; they're now up 25% just this year (as of May 9).\n\nWith a market cap of nearly $2 trillion, Amazon is undoubtedly one of the world's most valuable businesses. But that doesn't mean its forward returns are going to be limited. In fact, this remains the ultimate growth stock to buy with $1,000 right now.\n\nMultiple growth engines\n\nInvestors seem to be very happy with Amazon's advertising business, which has become a top player in the industry that can be mentioned in the same breath as heavyweights Alphabet and Meta Platforms. The company's ad sales surged 24% year over year in Q1 to total $11.8 billion.\n\nBesides displaying ads on its online marketplace, a website that sees billions of visitors every month, Amazon started showing ads on its Prime Video service. As more consumers turn to streaming entertainment, the ability to monetize this attention will only increase over time.\n\nAmazon's remarkable success in the digital ad space highlights just one of the numerous growth drivers the company possesses. Of course, we can't ignore e-commerce, which still only represents less than 16% of overall retail spending in the U.S. According to Grand View Research, money spent shopping online will rise by 11% annually until 2030.\n\nWith a nearly 40% online share today, Amazon is going to capture a sizable chunk of this opportunity by leaning heavily on its sprawling logistics footprint to better serve customers with fast and free shipping. No other company can compete with this.\n\nCloud computing is another area that will drive results for a very long time. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's industry-leading cloud platform that has 31% market share, posted a 17% revenue jump in Q1. While it only represented 17% of Amazon's total sales, it generated 61% of operating income. AWS is an extremely profitable and scaled player in the industry.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) will only result in more demand for AWS' various offerings. Clients can lean on its tools and features to develop their own AI services, making AWS more of a mission-critical infrastructure provider.\n\nProfits are soaring\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms about Amazon has been that it generates low profits. Because the business invests so aggressively in new growth opportunities, its bottom-line performance hasn't been a top priority. But this is starting to change for the better.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first three months of this year, the company produced $15.3 billion of operating income, up 219% year over year. Cost-cutting measures and a heightened focus on driving efficiencies across the organization are starting to bear fruit. Operating income is expected to total $12 billion in Q2 (at the midpoint), translating to a 56% increase compared to the second quarter last year.\n\nLong-term investors should want the management teams of the businesses that they own to operate with sound financial principles in mind. However, one goal is also to not ignore expansion opportunities that can boost earnings power over time.\n\n\"We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements,\" CEO Andy Jassy said on the Q1 2024 earnings call. That seems like the right balance.\n\nConsider the valuation\n\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Amazon have soared 126%. There is much more optimism surrounding the business than there was a couple of years ago, thanks to strong financial results.\n\nThe valuation, now at a price-to-sales ratio of 3.4, still doesn't look expensive to me, though. This multiple is in line with its trailing-five-year average.\n\nInvestors looking to load up on a fantastic growth stock that also trades at a reasonable valuation should consider buying Amazon today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "To build lasting wealth with stocks, you want to look for companies with plenty of room to expand for many years. No matter how the stock performs in the near term, a company that grows its revenue significantly over decades will bring the stock along with it.\n\nOn that note, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Roblox(NYSE: RBLX) have a lot going for them right now. Amazon still offers significant growth potential because of its leading position in the burgeoning cloud computing market. Meanwhile, Roblox is a popular interactive platform where younger audiences play games and interact with others. Here's more on why these stocks are promising investments over the long term.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nA massive selection of goods, fast shipping, and convenience have been hallmarks of the Amazon brand for over 20 years. The stock has been a truly wealth-building investment, but investors should never underestimate the ability of a great business to keep growing. The main reasons to invest in Amazon boil down to its opportunities in e-commerce and cloud services.\n\nThe company's technological roots building a superior online shopping experience have allowed it to branch out to other lucrative revenue opportunities like cloud computing. Spending on cloud infrastructure totaled $76 billion in the first quarter and grew 21% year over year, according to Synergy Research. Although Microsoft's Azure cloud service is gaining market share, Amazon Web Services is still the leader.\n\nThough AWS has a higher profit margin, the retail side of Amazon is still the core of its business. Amazon's retail and related services generated $496 billion in total revenue over the last year, but that still leaves a lot of opportunity in the $6 trillion global e-commerce market -- based on eMarketer's estimate -- which is continuing to grow.\n\nAnalysts see the company's earnings per share growing at 23% per year over the next several years. Just as Walmart is still delivering returns for investors after 50 years as a publicly traded company, Amazon could very well be compounding shareholders' investment for decades.\n\n2. Roblox\n\nInvesting in the growth of interactive entertainment is a good bet, considering the video game industry is expected to grow from $211 billion to over $600 billion by 2029, according to Statista. Consistent with that estimate, Roblox already has reached 77 million daily active users and is still growing.\n\nThe stock is trading well off its highs. That can be traced back to a high valuation following its direct listing a few years ago and slowing revenue growth in 2022. Roblox is clearly not immune to broader economic pressures on consumer spending, but the discounted share price could look like a bargain after another decade worth of growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox offers a variety of games and experiences, including virtual music concerts, to attract people to the platform. It then looks to make money from offering virtual currency that is used to unlock premium content. It's also working on other ways to monetize players, such as welcoming brands to advertise on the platform.\n\nRoblox's revenue has accelerated back above 20% in recent quarters, and management expects to grow the top line at least 20% per year through at least 2027. The growing selection of experiences available, such as home construction and other content that appeals to older players, is helping Roblox continue to attract more users and is why the stock should be a long-term winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top AI Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be one of the biggest revolutionary advancements in technology that the world has ever seen. Companies are just starting to embrace the technology and what it can do. However, the early results are very promising, allowing organizations to become more efficient and better serve their customers.\n\nBut make no mistake, artificial intelligence is still in its early days, and there are a lot of opportunities for investors to profit from companies helping lead the way with AI. Let's look at some of the best stocks to play the AI bull run.\n\nNvidia\n\nNo company is benefiting more from AI at the moment than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The maker of graphics processing unit (GPUs) has become the backbone of the infrastructure needed to power AI applications in data centers. GPU chips are able to do technical calculations faster and with less energy than central processing units (CPUs), which makes them ideal for use in AI training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPUs, meanwhile, have become the industry gold standard due to its CUDA software platform, which allows its chips to be programmed directly, saving customers time and money.\n\nNvidia will continue to be the go-to company for building out the more powerful data centers needed to power AI applications. Meanwhile, Nvidia isn't a one-trick pony, and its networking business is also greatly benefiting from AI.\n\nNvidia has been putting up incredible growth, including a more than tripling of its revenue during its most recent quarter. Despite that, the stock is attractively valued at only a 36 forward P/E, setting it up for a bull run as the business grows and investors push up the stock price. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAmazon\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be the first stock that comes to mind. However, the e-commerce giant has been heavily investing in the technology.\n\nThe company owns the largest cloud business, Amazon Web Services or AWS, which is benefiting from the proliferation of AI. It has also developed two chips, Trainium and Inferentia, to be used specifically for AI applications.\n\nOn the software side, the company has developed platforms to help customers build their own AI models and applications. Its SageMaker platform helps customers build, train, and deploy machine learning models, while its Bedrock platform gives customers high-performing models from Amazon and other leading AI companies through a single API to help them build AI applications.\n\nAmazon has also built out its own AI-powered assistant for software developers, Amazon Q. The AI assistant can write, test, and debug code. It can also answer questions about company policies, products, and other topics.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has shown in the past that it is willing to spend big to ultimately win big, and AI appears to be no exception. Trading at a forward P/E of around 41, the stock has room to run given the AI growth opportunities in front of the company. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nSoundHound AI\n\nShares of SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) skyrocketed earlier this year on news that Nvidia had made an investment in the AI-powered voice assistant company. However, more recently, the stock has come back down to a more reasonable level.\n\nSoundhound's technology helps voice assistants and humans interact more naturally, allowing users to ask more complex questions while getting better answers. The company has made strong inroads in the automobile industry and is making good progress in the restaurant space as well. However, the applications of its technology should expand far beyond these two industry verticals.\n\nThe company has an attractive recurring revenue business model whereby it gets royalty payments based on volume, usage, or the life of the product. For applications where no product is involved, such as with its restaurant offering, it uses a subscription model. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoundHound is still relatively small, generating only $46 million in revenue last year. However, it has a large booking backlog of $661 million, which if honored will turn into revenue over the next several years. The weighted average length of its contracts is about six and a half years, with more revenue backend loaded. Much of the company's backlog comes from its relationships with about 20 auto brands and having its technology built into new models of their vehicles.\n\nTrading at over 21 times forward sales, SoundHound stock is not cheap. However, its valuation has come down a lot in recent months, and it has a lot of potential to grow if it can continue to move its technology into more products. Getting into smartphones, for example, would be a game changer for the company and the stock.

        "title": "25 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 careers with the most job security in the US. We have also talked about growing concerns about job insecurity due to AI. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Authority Hacker, with a sample of 1200 full-time workers, job insecurity looms large over the American workforce as over half of full-time employees express growing concerns. Strikingly, the tech industry which is largely believed to be synonymous with innovation, is witnessing an increase in anxiety, attributed to recurrent mass layoffs and the specter of AI replacing human roles. According to the survey, men exhibit a higher propensity for job insecurity compared to women, with those earning $150,000 or more exhibiting the highest concern. Moreover, professions most vulnerable to AI disruption such as IT, software development, and advertising, report the most severe cases of anxieties.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that one of the most vulnerable jobs to AI are that of customer service representatives which are also known to have the most oversaturated jobs.\n\nApart from concerns of job insecurity due to AI, job insecurity has been a persistent concern, especially during economic downturns in the US. Despite claims that recessions have become less common over time, skepticism remains due to historical data discrepancies. According to Business Insider, between 1990 and 2023, the US experienced 36 months of recession, compared to 59 months between 1960 and 1989. However, the reliability of recession data before 1950 is questionable which potentially skewes perceptions of historical recession frequency.\n\nSpeaking of economic downturns, in April 2024, the US observed a major slowdown in job growth as employers only added 175,000 positions. This trend was accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate from 3.8% to 3.9%, according to the Labor Department.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates since 2022 also aimed to temper economic expansion and alleviate inflationary pressures. However, with inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target at 3.5% in March, there were doubts about the timing of further rate cuts. Nonetheless, the unexpected slowdown in job growth in April raised expectations for potential rate adjustments later in the year. Despite the tempered job growth, some sectors like healthcare, continued to drive employment gains. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.9% over the 12 months to April, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow that we are talking about job gains, it is worth highlighting that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is set to construct an $800 million data center spanning 715,000 square feet in Montgomery, Alabama. This data center is anticipated to generate 100 job opportunities. Located near the Interstate 65 and Hyundai's automotive assembly plant, the site was announced by Governor Kay Ivey at Montgomery Whitewater and is slated for completion by 2026. Over 1,000 construction workers are expected to be engaged at the peak of its construction.\n\nThis is one of the most significant investments by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in Alabama, following the establishment of its first data center campus in Huntsville in 2021, which currently employs approximately 300 individuals. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s total investment in the state amounts to $1.5 billion.\n\nMontgomery will become home to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s 24th data hub and its 20th in the United States. The city was selected owing to its accessibility to infrastructure, renewable energy availability, and a rich pool of talent. Once operational, the facility is slated to achieve LEED Gold certification, utilize 100% renewable energy, and attain net-zero emissions.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) has announced a monumental investment of $11 billion in Indiana which is expected to generate a minimum of 1,000 job opportunities. With the backing of Governor Eric Holcomb and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will establish new data centers in St. Joseph County to fortify infrastructure and economic growth in the region. Since 2010, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested $21.5 billion in Indiana and hence, has contributed largely to the state's gross domestic product and created over 26,000 full- and part-time positions. 25 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US\n\nAn executive MBA student working late in a study carrel, gaining job-ready skills.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the careers with the most job security in the US, we relied on the growth rates of jobs in the US between 2022 and 2032. The idea is that fastest growing jobs often stem from industries with high demand, innovation, and adaptability. These sectors tend to evolve rapidly that create a plethora of opportunities for skilled workers. This influx of job opportunities contributes to the security of fastest-growing professions by providing a broader range of employment options. For job growth rates, we relied on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USA.\n\nIn case of similar growth rates for any two jobs, the job with a higher number of projected job openings is ranked higher.\n\nPlease note that the data points covering median/average salaries, job growth percentages, and numbers of job openings for each role have been also primarily obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year 2023.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n25. Substance Abuse, Behavioral Disorder, and Mental Health Counselors\n\nGrowth Rate: 18%\n\nAccording to a 2022 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and CNN, 90% of the public perceives a mental health crisis in the United States as a mjaor portion of the population reports frequent anxiety. Shockingly, one-third of respondents couldn't access the mental health services they needed due to barriers like cost and stigma. The shortage of mental health providers worsens the issue as 60% of psychologists report no openings for new patients, as per the APA's 2022 COVID-19 Practitioner Impact Survey.\n\n24. Speech-Language Pathologists\n\nGrowth Rate: 19%\n\nSpeech-language pathologists (SLPs) earn a median salary of $89,290 annually. A master’s degree is one of the typical entry requirements for this role. No prior work experience in related fields is necessary, but on-the-job training through internships or residencies is common. In 2022, there were 171,400 SLP jobs.\n\n23. Financial Examiners\n\nGrowth Rate: 20%\n\nThe mean annual wage for financial examiners in the US is $98,140. District of Columbia and New York are the highest paying states for financial examiners with average salary of $170,530 and $128,270 respectively. Between 2022 and 2032, 12,800 new jobs for financial examiners are expected to be open.\n\n22. Veterinarians\n\nGrowth Rate: 20%\n\nWith an average salary of $136,300 as of 2023 with a growth rate of 20%, it is one of the secure jobs that pay well. Massachusetts is the highest paying state for Veterinarians in America. Between 2022 and 2032, 17,700 new jobs for veterinarians are expected to be open.\n\nTo read more about veterinarians, see the highest paying countries for veterinarians.\n\n21. Veterinary Assistants and Laboratory Animal Caretakers\n\nGrowth Rate: 20%\n\nVeterinary assistants and lab animal caretakers do not need fancy degrees, just a high school diploma or equivalent for a job. No prior experience is required either, and they get trained on the job. They are paid a decent median salary of $36,440 per year in the US. The projected employment change for these roles is 23,500 between 2022 and 2032.\n\n20. Veterinary Technologists and Technicians\n\nGrowth Rate: 21%\n\nWith a median salary of $43,740 annually, veterinary technologists and technicians usually hold an Associate's degree and need no prior work experience or on-the-job training. The field is booming, with a projected 21% job growth from 2022 to 2032 that will result in an estimated 25,200 new job opportunities by 2032.\n\n19. Personal Care and Service Workers\n\nGrowth Rate: 21%\n\nThe personal care and service workers in the US make $37,190 annually on average in the US. It is worth noting that educational support services and special food services are the two top-paying industries for personal care and service workers in America. Almost 35,600 new jobs for personal care and service workers will be available between 2022 and 2032.\n\n18. Taxi Drivers\n\nGrowth Rate: 21%\n\nWith a growth rate of 21%, taxi drivers have one of the most secure jobs in America. While the average salary of $35,120 in the US may not be so impressive, Texas pays the highest salaries for taxi drivers with an average of more than $50,000 annually. A growth of 21% will translate into 53,000 new jobs for taxi drivers in the US.\n\n17. Solar Photovoltaic Installers\n\nGrowth Rate: 22%\n\nSolar photovoltaic installers have a median salary of $48,800 annually. They typically enter the field with a high school diploma or equivalent. With no prior work experience required, they undergo moderate-term on-the-job training. The profession is expected to grow with a projected 22% job outlook from 2022 to 2032 and will translate into 6600 new job openings.\n\nIt is also one of the fastest growing green jobs in the world.\n\n16. Home Health and Personal Care Aides\n\nGrowth Rate: 22%\n\nWith an anticipated job growth of 22% from 2022 to 2032, adding 804,600 new positions, the demand for these aides is exceptionally high. This increase is primarily driven by the ageing population in the United States that has led to an increased need for long-term care services.\n\n15. Actuaries\n\nGrowth Rate: 23%\n\nWith a projected job outlook of 23% from 2022 to 2032, the field anticipates adding 7,000 jobs by 2032, making it one of the professions that has the highest demand in USA. In 2022, there were 30,000 positions for the role. Actuaries play a highly critical role in risk assessment and financial planning which makes their expertise highly demanded in different sectors such as insurance, finance, and consulting.\n\n14. Computer and Information Research Scientists\n\nGrowth Rate: 23%\n\nComputer science is one of the fields with the most job opportunities in the USA. Moreover, Data from the US Department of Labor indicates that computer science positions, especially those requiring a master's degree, are among the fastest-growing in the US. Those with just a bachelor's degree already command median salaries exceeding $97,000, but pursuing a master's degree can largely boost earnings.

        "title": "3 Game-Changing Stocks to Unlock Life-Changing Wealth",
        "content": "Finding game-changing stocks in today’s relatively overvalued and volatile market isn’t as straightforward as it was when initial rate cuts drove top stocks to rock bottom prices. While many quickly point to tech stocks as the main wealth-unlocking stocks in today’s economy, forward-thinking investors recognize the importance of diversifying across industries, geographic locations, size, scale, and more.\n\nIdentifying wealth-unlocking stocks also requires thorough due diligence to confirm that a company has a strategic vision and actionable plans to achieve its goals. Financial fundamentals and strength are crucial today; even the best strategies are futile if the company risks bankruptcy.\n\nThese game-changing stocks span a diverse range of sectors and value propositions, yet they all stand on solid financial footing and boast brighter long-term prospects than much of the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) image of a cloud surrounded by various symbols related to internet connectivity and interaction\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-purchaser eCommerce continues to soar in popularity, as demonstrated by giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT), a lesser-known but significant player, targets the massive B2B market, creating a comprehensive platform for businesses to source products and manage all associated logistics.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing, and payment processing. GigaCloud addresses these challenges by providing a complete suite of scaled B2B eCommerce solutions, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and critically, secure cross-border payment processing.\n\nGigaCloud’s financial metrics are particularly striking. Despite a low price-to-earnings ratio of just 16.6—less than the tech sector average of 36x—the company has doubled its earnings per share over the last few quarters. and has robust free cash flow.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) occupies a unique position at the intersection of semiconductor stocks and wealth-unlocking stocks, a standout in a sector where many options are becoming increasingly expensive. The company specializes in developing semiconductor photomasks, a critical niche within the semiconductor sector with significant future implications.\n\nPhotronics’ semiconductor photomasks enhance the precision and accuracy necessary for patterning microchips, advancing cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which demand increasingly complex and precise circuitry. Moreover, these photomasks contain fine details crucial for miniaturizing transistors and components, executing Moore’s Law by shrinking complex technology. Trading at just 14x earnings, Photronics’ blend of compelling value propositions and affordability places it at the vital nexus of current and emerging technologies, making it a prime candidate among game-changing stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX) a hand holding a lightbulb on a green background to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) is far less speculative than the others but still one of those wealth-unlocking stocks. The company trades at appealing low multiples — just 8x forward earnings and 0.5x sales — and maintains a low profile in the green tech and sustainable driving sectors. The company manufactures a range of automotive parts designed to reduce emissions and support zero-emission technologies, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nAmid dwindling consumer interest in pure-electric vehicles, highlighted by the rising sales of hybrid and gasoline vehicles over electric ones, Garrett Motion represents a practical investment for those focused on sustainability but skeptical about the swift global adoption of EVs.\n\nThe company’s stock recently fell following an earnings report that revealed a 6% drop in quarterly sales, though its annual sales remained consistent and both margins and free cash flow remained strong. Despite being overlooked due to the market’s fascination with rapid-growth opportunities, Garrett Motion is poised for recognition as economic shifts favor small-cap value stocks over current mega-cap market leaders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "2 Spectacular Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Finding the right stocks for your portfolio doesn't have to be difficult. Great businesses are built to withstand the test of time even as stock prices shift.\n\nQuality companies continue to widen their moats even in rocky periods, and share prices will eventually follow. As the market has had a solid first several months of 2024, if you're looking for top stocks to buy and hold for the long haul, you don't have to search far.\n\nHere are two rock-solid buys to add to your basket right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't a new name to investors. This diversified tech giant continues to prove that its businesses can withstand the shifting tide of the markets in which it operates and generate substantial profits in the process.\n\nAmazon's strides in the world of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are driving its mainstay cloud-computing business forward, the segment that accounts for most of the company's operating income. Meanwhile, its flagship e-commerce business continues to account for most of its overall net sales. The company is also witnessing notable growth in other areas, including its advertising business.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's net sales rose 13% year over year to $143 billion. Sales from its cloud-computing segment rose 17% from the year-ago period to $25 billion. Online-store sales totaled approximately $55 billion, while sales from third-party seller services came to around $35 billion, up 7% and 16%, respectively, from one year ago. The advertising segment raked in $12 billion in net sales, a whopping 24% increase from one year ago.\n\nAmazon's operating income totaled $15 billion, up approximately 219% from one year ago. Of that total, AWS segment-operating income accounted for $9.4 billion, or more than half of overall-operating income. Amazon's net income more than tripled from one year ago, reaching $10.4 billion in Q1 2024.\n\nThe company's generative AI platform Amazon Bedrock is being used across countless use cases from clients in very regulated industries like banking and insurance to healthcare companies. As one example, management said in the company's Q1 earnings report that the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute built a new research tool using Bedrock that helps medical providers interpret lab results to reach diagnoses, evaluate treatment regimens, and determine forms of care.\n\nMeanwhile, Volkswagen Group's Audi used other AI tools like its cloud-based machine learning platform Amazon Sagemaker and its OpenSearch Service to make a generative AI chatbot that streamlines both enterprise and internal operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe sky appears to be the limit for Amazon and its long-term growth runway. This is a buying proposition that investors might be hard-pressed to overlook.\n\n2. Pinterest\n\nPinterest (NYSE: PINS) has had its fair share of ups and downs following its peak of growth during the pandemic. Even as the company is dealing with a still-challenging ad-spending environment, its financials are improving consistently with each passing quarter.\n\nIts focus on operational efficiency and improving its advertiser experience with an increasing array of ad formats is paying off. In Q1 2024, Pinterest hit a huge milestone for its business. It now has roughly 518 million active users on its platform every single month. That figure was up 12% from one year ago, but approximately 78% from the same quarter in 2019.\n\nOn the financial front, the company brought in revenue of $740 million in Q1 2024. That was a very healthy 23% bump from one year ago. Pinterest reported a net loss of about $25 million according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but that was a notable 88% improvement from its net loss one year ago.\n\nPinterest generated adjusted earnings of $113 million, an increase of 319% from the same quarter last year. Global average revenue per Pinterest user totaled $1.46 in Q1 2024, up 10% from one year ago. This is also a business that is bringing in considerable cash flow, with operating cash flow jumping 94% year over year to $356 million in Q1.\n\nPinterest makes money from running ads for businesses of all sizes, and management has stated that its goal is to make every \"pin\" shoppable eventually. The company has made a stream of updates to its ad offerings in recent years and just launched shoppable video pins this past quarter.\n\nThis means that a user could search for a topic of interest, find a video ad that aligns with that topic, and click the video to view a deck of pins that match the items in that video. Then, they can click any one of those pins to be taken directly to a product or service to purchase.\n\nThere's so much room left for Pinterest to grow as ad spending recovers. Given the unique advertising format of its platform, investors might want to consider even a modest position in this stock in the near future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nWhen you don't even realize your money decisions are keeping you from unlocking greater wealth, you in effect have the \"oh sh*t\" moment that Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita and yours truly had at the Milken Institute conference this week after chatting with Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik.\n\nMailik calls the investment shots for the money-managing giant, which boasts $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Suffice to say, she wasn't on board with my 5% CD or Akiko's high-yield savings account.\n\nIn effect, we are part of the crowd making one of the biggest investing mistakes Mailik continues to see as she travels the world to communicate with investors.\n\n\"Cash on the sidelines [is one of the biggest mistakes], Malik said. \"Studies have shown that when you market time, you lose money relative to if you just stayed invested. This started last year as everyone expected a recession to come. They are holding their cash and 5% returns.\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong with 5% returns, but when the market is up, multiples of that and even fixed-income markets have yields that are higher than that today, [so] you're losing relative money. So I really recommend staying invested.\"\n\nMalik does make a valid point.\n\nThe S&P 500 returned 23% in 2023, including dividends, according to Bernstein data. Municipal bonds generated more than a 5% return. A 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds delivered over 17%.\n\nMoney market funds only yielded 3%, per Bernstein. Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik says put that money to work! Malik (right) talks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi and anchor Akiko Fujita at the Milken Institute Conference. (Yahoo Finance) (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThis year alone, the S&P 500 is up roughly 10% — getting the pep back in its step following a jobs report letdown.\n\nGrocery prices are up nearly 30% since 2019, and here I am crowing about a 5% seven-month CD.\n\n\"5% was good in 2014,\" Malik ribbed me.\n\nSilly Sozzi.\n\nSo with some $6 trillion currently parked in money market funds (aka \"cash on the sidelines\"), it's reasonable to think some of that gets put to work in 2024 amid more clarity on interest rates and the economy.\n\nMalik unsurprisingly suggests investing in stocks.\n\nShe likes defensive stocks that peddle infrastructure. Apple and Amazon could also be viewed as defensive plays, given their strong fundamentals, Malik says.\n\nOne other investing mistake to avoid while I have you: going all in on the Mag Seven such as Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Top names in finance, like Apollo's (APO) Marc Rowan (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management) and Avenue Capital Management's Marc Lasry, struck a cautious note on the Mag Seven trade in interviews with us at Milken.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow off to Bank of America I go!\n\nCurious on how to put cash to work in tech stocks beyond the Mag Seven? Former longtime Cisco (CSCO) CEO turned VC investor John Chambers walks us through his investing process in a new edition of the Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "What's happened to the artificial intelligence (AI) rally?\n\nIt's the question many investors are asking -- and for good reason. Shares of the hottest AI stocks, like Nvidia, cooled off in recent weeks.\n\nNevertheless, we must remember that holding through volatile, choppy markets is integral to the buy-and-hold strategy. Moreover, despite the current pessimism seeping into the market, the AI revolution is set to roll on for many years to come -- meaning there are still great AI stocks out there.\n\nHere are two that our panel of Motley Fool contributors think are worth considering and one they want to avoid. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicrosoft stock is a safe port for AI investors seeking refuge from recent volatility\n\nJake Lerch (Microsoft): Sometimes it's best to keep things simple. That's why my best AI stock to own right now is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nSure, Microsoft's stock isn't likely to go parabolic if the AI rally once again picks up steam. However, what the stock lacks in sizzle, it makes up for in stability: It's easy to sleep knowing you own Microsoft for the long term.\n\nEven though Microsoft is moving full-speed ahead on AI, it's far from a one-trick pony. The company has many business segments, such as gaming, enterprise and personal computing software, cloud services, and advertising. That diversification should comfort investors because the company relies on something other than just the growth of AI to fuel its revenue, profits, and cash flow.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31, 2024), Microsoft generated $61.9 billion in revenue, up 17% from a year earlier. Crucially, about $8.4 billion was returned to shareholders through dividend payments and stock buybacks.\n\nThat means Microsoft investors are getting paid to wait while the volatility in the AI sector sorts itself out. That can't be said for every AI stock, and it's one of the big reasons investors should still consider Microsoft stock a buy now.\n\nSurging profits make Amazon a bargain worth scooping up today\n\nJustin Pope (Amazon):Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) seems like a no-brainer, table-pounding buy today. The technology giant is a key chess piece in the AI game moving forward thanks to its market leadership in cloud services with AWS. Amazon is integrating AI functions into AWS to make it a foundation for customers to build and run their AI models. That's the 10-second elevator pitch. However, the company's recent short-term performance underlines the stock's value today.\n\nThe company just turned in stellar Q1 results. Trailing 12-month operating cash jumped 82% year over year to over $99 billion. Valuing the stock on earnings or free cash flow is tricky because Amazon stubbornly invests most of its profits to grow the business. Unlike Meta Platforms and Alphabet, there are no dividends here.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at the stock versus its operating cash flow gives investors a true peek at Amazon's value. As shown below, Amazon is now valued near its lowest multiple on operating cash flow in a decade despite the stock surging over 70% this past year. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon's magnificent rally might have plenty of juice left. The business is firing on all cylinders, and long-term investors get a diverse multiheaded monster packed with e-commerce, cloud, and advertising growth that keeps one industry from swaying the broader business. Buy Amazon confidently and hold for what should be stellar long-term returns.\n\nAI-generated gains may not be enough to save this stock\n\nWill Healy(C3.ai): At first glance, C3.ai(NYSE: AI) may look like a stock to buy. It develops AI-enhanced enterprise software that integrates with a company's existing software infrastructure, putting it in the company of other fast-growing AI stocks.\n\nAdditionally, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has fallen below 10. While not \"cheap,\" it compares well to many other AI companies that continue to trade at elevated valuations.\n\nHowever, investors can find significant problems when they examine the business more closely. For one, it expects to generate just over 35% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from oilfield services giant Baker Hughes. The current Baker Hughes contract expires in April 2025, meaning that revenue could soon disappear without a new agreement.\n\nMoreover, C3.ai will likely remain in poor financial shape even if it continues its business relationship with Baker Hughes. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, its $224 million in revenue rose by 15% versus the same year-ago period. This significantly lags many other AI stocks growing revenue at much faster rates.\n\nFurthermore, its operating expenses for the period came in at $363 million, almost 1.5 times its revenue. This resulted in a net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 at $207 million.\n\nAdmittedly, it holds about $723 million in liquidity, indicating it can maintain this pace in the near term. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether the company will ever become profitable, and such conditions could explain why C3.ai stock has given back most of its 12-month gains.\n\nBetween the uncertainty of the Baker Hughes relationship and the massive financial losses, investors are probably better off deploying capital in other AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $550,688!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Over the last year or so, many technology companies have made a splash in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft really kicked things off following an investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT. For a brief moment, it looked like Microsoft may have outmaneuvered its big tech peers.\n\nHowever, e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has started to emerge as formidable competitor in the AI realm. Let's dig into what Amazon is doing to accelerate its business, and explore why now is an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares.\n\nDon't call it a comeback\n\nThe macroeconomy has faced some stark challenges over the last couple of years, with unusually high inflation and rising interest rates impacting businesses and consumers. Unfortunately, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing operations are not immune to these measures, and the company's financial results undermine that.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2023, Amazon's free cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis stood at a negative $3.3 billion. Indeed, the chart illustrates the magnitude of Amazon's cash burn during periods of peak inflation and decelerating growth. AMZN Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHowever, fast-forward a year, and the narrative has changed dramatically. For the trailing-12-month period ended March 31, Amazon's free cash flow was $50.1 billion. Since bottoming out last spring, Amazon has turned its ship around and consistently generated positive cash flow. One of the big contributors to this turnaround is some acceleration in the cloud business in particular.\n\nWhat has Amazon been doing to jump-start its cloud services? Similar to Microsoft, Amazon has made some notable moves of its own in AI. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDon't overlook investments in AI\n\nBack in September, Amazon announced that it was investing $4 billion into an AI start-up called Anthropic. Interestingly, Anthropic's co-founders originally came from OpenAI. Per the terms of the deal, Anthropic agreed to primarily use Amazon's cloud infrastructure -- Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThis is a subtle, yet lucrative, component of the partnership with Anthropic because it should help lead to new sources of lead generation for AWS. Furthermore, Anthropic will also be training future versions of its generative AI models using Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips. I see this as another savvy move by Amazon.\n\nAt the moment, the AI chip market is dominated by Nvidia. And while Nvidia will likely continue owning considerable market share, Amazon's investments in developing its own chips and data centers could unlock further gains in the cloud business over the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon stock looks like a great value\n\nI think many investors are overlooking Amazon's progress and are thinking too narrowly as it pertains to the macroeconomy. The current inflation rate of 3.5% is well above the Federal Reserve's long-term target rate of 2%. However, it's important to understand just how much inflation has cooled compared to peak levels two years ago.\n\nThe chart paints an interesting picture. Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio reached a 10-year high back in 2020. However, not long after, the company's P/S ratio began sliding dramatically as inflation started soaring. Now, as inflation begins to cool, Amazon's P/S multiple appears to be normalizing. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nWhat I find fascinating about the dynamics in the chart is that even though Amazon's valuation multiples are rising, they are far from prior highs. On top of all of that, Amazon's P/S ratio is the lowest among the \"Magnificent Seven\" peer set. Considering how much Amazon has grown and redefined itself as an AI behemoth over the last couple of years, I think now is an opportunity to buy some shares at a discount.\n\nI think the growth narrative surrounding Amazon is clear. The company is in early stages of AI development, but it's already making major strides. Given the company's robust operating picture and dominant position in both e-commerce and cloud software, I'm encouraged by Amazon's momentum and am bullish they can keep it up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Surprising Reason the S&amp;P 500 Is Starting to Look Cheap",
        "content": "One of the easiest ways to get a reading on whether the market is overvalued is to look at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500. With a P/E of 27, the index looks expensive compared to historic levels.\n\nBut the market is forward looking and cares more about where companies are going than where they have been. Let's dive into some encouraging market data that indicates the S&P 500 might not be as expensive as it looks at first glance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe data\n\nNew findings from business data firm FactSet Research Systems show that 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. For the quarter, the growth rate for the S&P 500 is 5%, the highest level since Q2 2022. Earnings growth has been incredibly strong -- so strong, in fact, that the forward P/E of the S&P 500 is now 19.9.\n\nAccording to FactSet, that level is still above the five-year average of 19.1 and the 10-year average of 17.8, but it is lower than levels seen at the end of the first quarter of the calendar year on March 31.\n\nAccording to Luxembourg-based ISABELNET, a firm that has been doing private research on the U.S. stock market since 1998, consensus analyst estimates for the S&P 500 are $242 for 2024 earnings and $278 for 2025. At a level around 5,200, that would give the S&P 500 a P/E of 21.5 based on the 2024 forecast and 18.7 based on 2025 estimates.\n\nHere's a look at how the forward P/E has performed over the last five years and how it is expected to fall to around 20 by Q2 2025. S&P 500 P/E Ratio Forward Estimate Chart\n\nIn sum, growth is strong, earnings are delivering, and the S&P 500 is at a reasonable valuation.\n\nFaster growth justifies a higher multiple\n\nThe composition of the S&P 500 is currently more growth oriented than in the past.\n\nThe technology sector makes up 29.3% of the index. Consumer discretionary, dominated by Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), makes up 10.4%. Communications services -- heavily weighted in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- makes up 9.2%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which mirrors the performance of the S&P 500, has 30% of its weighting in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a term for seven top tech-focused companies that includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Nvidia alone now makes up more than 5% of the S&P 500.\n\nThe shift toward growth and tech has led to dramatic changes in the S&P 500 and fueled strong gains in the index led by megacap growth stocks. Growth stocks tend to fetch a premium valuation relative to their trailing earnings because investors are willing to pay up for the prospect of future earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith more and more of the S&P 500 allocated to growth stocks, it stands to reason its valuation should be higher than historic levels. By the same token, if the most valuable companies were instead safe, stodgy dividend-paying behemoths, we would expect the S&P 500's multiple to be lower than prior levels.\n\nTo see how growth can make an expensive stock look more affordable, let's look at the forward earnings estimates of the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNotice that Alphabet and Meta Platforms have roughly the same forward P/E as the S&P 500 despite being high-quality cash cows with above-average growth prospects and impeccable balance sheets.\n\nEven Nvidia, which embodies artificial intelligence-fueled market euphoria, has a 35.9 forward P/E -- which is less than half of its current 75.9 P/E ratio -- because consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings to double over the next year.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nThe stock market can do just about anything in the short term. But over the long term, it's all about how much money companies are making and how much they are expected to make in the future.\n\nIf you were to look solely at big tech stock prices or the levels of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, you might conclude that this market rally looks overextended. But earnings have delivered and are backing up the rally.\n\nThe lesson here is that price doesn't dictate value. Growth stocks were way oversold at the end of 2022, so there was some initial catching up to do in 2023. But the rally has persisted since then because of earnings growth.\n\nOverall, the stock market looks healthy and is going up for generally the right reasons. But there will always be pockets of speculation and greed.\n\nTo filter out the noise, focus on the underlying investment theses of the companies you like: their performance, what's driving or hindering results, and whether the valuation makes sense. This approach will help ensure you invest in a company for the right reasons and will allow you to stay on an even keel no matter how choppy the market becomes.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,115!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $34,588!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $329,437!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 6, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership Insider ownership in Amazon.com is 11%\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 62% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amazon.com, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Amazon.com is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Amazon.com's case, its Top Key Executive, Jeffrey Bezos, is the largest shareholder, holding 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.0% of the stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Amazon.com, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$211b stake in this US$2.0t business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nMany find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

        "title": "GOOG Stock Analysis: Unlocking the Future Potential of Alphabet in 2024",
        "content": "Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager, advocates owning a small group of stocks. He’s willing to ride these best ideas for years. One of those best ideas is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.38 million Class C and 4.35 million Class A shares. Together, Pershing has nearly $2 billion in Alphabet stock.\n\nAckman’s stake in Google’s parent company accounts for more than 18.5% of his firm’s $10.4 billion in assets reported in its Q4 2023 13-F. With the two share classes combined, Alphabet is Pershing’s second-highest holding by percentage, surpassed only by Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) at just less than 19%.\n\nExcept for Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW), each of Pershing’s seven holdings has a weighting of at least 11%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou could argue that Alphabet stock should be the hedge fund’s largest position. Here’s why.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Alphabet Stock\n\nThrough Q1 2024, Alphabet’s trailing 12-month free cash flow was $69.11 billion, 21.7% of its $318.15 billion in revenue. Adding up the trailing 12-month free cash flow of Pershing’s other six holdings, it comes to $11.88 billion, or about one-sixth Alphabet’s.\n\nBased on the other six’s combined revenue of $129.08 billion, the average margin is 9.2%, less than half of Alphabet’s.\n\nFree Cash Flow Margins — Pershing Square Capital Management Holdings\n\nCompany Free Cash Flow (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Margin Alphabet $69.11 billion $318.15 billion 21.7% QSR International $1.25 billion $7.17 billion 17.4% Lowe’s Companies $6.18 billion $86.38 billion 7.2% Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) $1.32 billion $10.20 billion 12.9% Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) $1.74 billion $10.52 billion 16.5% Howard Hughes Holdings (NYSE:HHH) -$266 million $999 million N/A Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) $1.65 billion $13.81 billion 11.9%\n\nAll the other holdings possess healthy free cash flow, except for Howard Hughes, a real estate developer who doesn’t focus on this financial metric. You can’t go out of business if you bring in more cash than you send out.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Pershing cut its Lowe’s holdings by 82%. Ackman likely left some money on the table as LOW stock hit a 52-week high of $262.49 in March. I would not be surprised if Pershing sold out of its Lowe’s position in the first quarter, given it paid an average of $100.43 a share.\n\nIf you take out Lowe’s numbers, the free cash flow margin for the other five stocks jumps to 13.3% [free cash flow of $5.70 billion divided by $42.70 billion], 840 basis points less than Alphabet.\n\nThere is no question that Alphabet is the best free cash flow generator.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Does It Compare to the Other Magnificent 7 Stocks?\n\nThere are 64 analysts covering GOOG/GOOGL stock, with 50 rating it a Buy with a $195 target price, 14% higher than where it currently trades. So, that’s 78% of analysts rating it a Buy.\n\nHere’s how it compares to the other Mag 7 stocks.\n\nAnalyst Buy Rating Percentages — Magnificent 7 Stocks\n\nCompany # of Analysts  Buy Rating % Alphabet 64 78% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 46 65% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 59 95% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 65 97% Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 59 88% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 51 41% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) 67 85%\n\nAt least from the perspective of analysts, Alphabet is not the favorite Mag 7 stock.\n\nI won’t review all the free cash flow margins for the other six Mag 7 stocks. However, Amazon, which has the highest Buy percentage at 97%, has a free cash flow margin of 7.7% based on $45.70 billion in TTM free cash flow and $590.74 billion in revenue.\n\nIn fairness to Amazon, if you exclude its e-commerce revenue, the free cash flow generation is much stronger. With all it has going with its ad business and AI, its free cash in about five years will be considerably more impressive. It’s not hard to see why so many analysts rate it a buy.\n\nNext up is Microsoft, which has a 95% Buy percentage. It’s more of an apples-to-apples comparison. Its free cash flow margin is 29.8% based on $70.58 billion in TTM free cash flow and $236.58 billion in revenue.\n\nSatya Nadella is one of the best CEOs in America. Since taking the helm on Feb. 4, 2014, MSFT stock is up 1020%, 544 percentage points higher than Alphabet over the same period.\n\nMSFT is the class of the Mag 7.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GOOG Stock\n\nLast December, I wrote about how Alphabet was spending money in all the wrong places. Notably, it had repurchased more than $100 billion of its stock over the previous two years. And while its underperforming shares made some buybacks worthwhile, it should have invested at least 50% of these funds in its business.\n\nThe company’s employees are fed up with shareholders getting all the benefits of its strong free cash flow.\n\n“Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases,” Fortune reportedCNBC comments made by an employee after the company’s blowout quarter. “When will employee compensation fairly reflect the company’s success and is there a conscious decision to keep wages lower due to a cooling employment market?”\n\nIf you can only buy one Mag 7 stock, Microsoft is the call. However, Alphabet’s free cash flow always keeps it in the mix.\n\nAlphabet is a Moderate Buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "50 Billion Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's no Tomorrow",
        "content": "Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) efforts to reduce costs in the retail business, including optimizing inventory at its fulfillment centers, is starting to pay huge dividends on the bottom line. The business generated an impressive $50 billion in free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period, a massive turnaround from negative $3 billion in the same period a year ago.\n\nAmazon's growing free cash flow is already paving the way for more aggressive capital investments in Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- the company's highly profitable cloud-services business. This could have positive implications on the stock's returns over the next several years.\n\nAre investors underestimating Amazon's cloud opportunity?\n\nAmazon's cloud business is starting to see accelerating growth again as companies adopt artificial intelligence (AI) services. Over the last four quarters, Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $29 billion of operating profit on $94 billion of revenue.\n\nOn the first-quarter earnings call in April, CEO Andy Jassy said there were \"unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us.\" Jassy explained that most of the world's spending on information technology is still on legacy, on-premise servers that companies manage themselves. That leaves a gigantic opportunity for cloud-computing providers like AWS.\n\nThe increasing adoption of chat-based AI assistants, or generative AI, is providing a strong incentive for these companies to move IT spending from on-premise to the cloud. In Q1, revenue from AWS grew 17% year over year, accelerating from 13% in 2023's Q4.\n\nAt its current rate of growth, AWS revenue could double again in the next five years; given that it already generates most of Amazon's operating profit, growth in AWS will move the needle for the share price.\n\nHowever, AWS can't continue to grow without more data-center capacity. That's why Amazon's $50 billion in free cash flow will be valuable as Amazon tries to protect its lead in the cloud-services market.\n\nAmazon spent $14 billion in capital expenditures in Q1, primarily to expand its AWS infrastructure and generative AI efforts, and management expects it to increase from there. Most of its capital spending this year will go to support AWS infrastructure and generative AI efforts.\n\nWhy buy Amazon stock\n\nWhile Amazon's capital-spending plan could pressure profits within the AWS segment this year, Amazon has a history of realizing high returns on its investments.\n\nFor example, despite building a transportation network the size of UPS during the pandemic, and tripling its capital expenditures to over $60 billion in the process, Amazon's net income is now at record highs. Its retail operation is now focused on bringing down costs of delivering goods to customers, including increasing the number units shipped per box, which could bring even more upside to the bottom line and grow its free cash flow over the next several years.\n\nStory continues AMZN data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon's market cap (share price times the total shares outstanding) is now close to $2 trillion.\n\nHowever, AWS alone could be worth almost half of that, or $940 billion, applying a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 10 to its annual revenue of $94 billion. That is an average valuation for a fast-growing software business. A few years ago, Redburn analyst Alex Haissl estimated AWS was on a path to reach a $3 trillion value. If that estimate is accurate, it would mean Amazon's shares are undervalued by a good margin.\n\nAmazon doesn't spend money unless it sees a clear path to generating returns, so investors should expect AWS to become more profitable and grow Amazon's free cash flow.\n\nAnalysts project Amazon's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 23% over the next several years, which could also be used as a reasonable estimate for free-cash-flow growth. That's more than enough growth to double the share price within the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top 4 \"Secret\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Should Know",
        "content": "When everyone from your barber to your mailman to your financial advisor is talking about a stock, it's probably time to consider alternatives. This seems to be the case with Nvidia, whose stock has risen an incredible 500% over the past three years. Nvidia is a terrific company and will have a long, prosperous future. But here are four lesser-known artificial intelligence (AI) companies for investors looking to add flavor to their portfolio.\n\nEvolv Technologies\n\nSecurity at schools, sporting events and concerts, hospitals, and other gatherings is a top priority, given the rise of mass shooting incidents. It's an unfortunate fact of life these days. Traditional security consists of metal detectors and secondary screenings with wands. This model is inefficient for several reasons. Among them are benign objects like keys and wallets setting off the detectors; plus, people must go through them single file, creating huge lines. Evolv Technologies(NASDAQ: EVLV) uses artificial intelligence to create a solution.\n\nEvolv's sensors look similar to metal detectors, but they use AI to detect weapons based on shape and other characteristics. They don't alert for benign metal objects, and multiple people can walk in at once. You may have experienced them and not even realized it. I noticed this technology was in place when I recently saw the Vegas Golden Knights play at T-Mobile Arena. New York City is now testing the tech on subways after a rash of violence. Overall, 800 schools, 300 hospitals, and 40 pro sports teams use Evolv.\n\nEvolv provides the software for the detectors, so most revenue is recurring, a terrific long-term business model. Customer accumulation is another significant step for Evolv right now, and the numbers are excellent, as you can see below. Image source: Evolv Technologies.\n\nEvolv has a market cap of $600 million, with $75 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Because it is a small, high-growth company, it is a speculative stock. This means it will be volatile and riskier than large, established companies. Don't bet the farm on speculative stocks. Instead, take a nibble now and then if you see potential.\n\nUiPath\n\nThe business world is more competitive than ever, and efficiency is critical to beating the competition. This means automating repetitive tasks that aren't value-added. Robotic process automation (RPA) companies like UiPath(NYSE: PATH) provide the tools to do just that.\n\nRPA mimics a repetitive process normally completed by a human using software. A simple example is data entry, but customer engagement, call center efficiency, and automated bidding are also use cases. The implication for operational efficiency is clear.\n\nStory continues\n\nUiPath reports close to 11,000 customers and $1.5 billion ARR. Total revenue was $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2024, with 24% growth, which accelerated to 31% in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. UiPath guided for tepid 18% ARR growth in fiscal 2025, and the stock reflects this, trading for 8.5 times sales (considerably lower than other growing software companies). Conditions are ripe for management to beat these numbers, and that could lead to gains for shareholders.\n\nArm Holdings\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) has been in the news recently, so the secret is leaking out. Still, this is a company that tech investors should know. Arm is a semiconductor (\"chip\") industry leader, but it doesn't make chips. Arm designs the infrastructure (Arm calls it the \"architecture\") of advanced chips that other companies customize and build. Arm then receives a royalty and license fee for each chip sold.\n\nArm's reach is enormous -- its tech is used in 99% of smartphones, and 280 billion chips using its architecture have been sold to date. Two things intrigue me most about Arm: free cash flow (FCF) and stacked recurring revenue.\n\nAs I said, Arm doesn't make the chips. This means it doesn't have massive infrastructure costs for factories, raw materials, labor, and overhead like manufacturing companies, and that means more cash in its pockets. Each dollar of revenue produces $0.30 of FCF, allowing it to grow long-term debt-free with $3.6 billion in current assets against $866 million in current liabilities.\n\nWhen Arm launches a new product, products produced for other applications still make money, as depicted below. Image source: Arm Holdings.\n\nThese legacy products are extremely profitable since the development costs happened long ago. Meanwhile, new sales streams stack up.\n\nArm is difficult to value because there aren't any good comparables, and it has only been public for a short time. For this reason, dollar-cost averaging is a terrific strategy for interested investors.\n\nAmazon\n\nOf course, we all know Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). It is one of the most recognizable brands on Earth. However, you may not know its huge potential in AI. AI applications, like generative AI, require colossal amounts of data moving at lightning speed. Cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) are crucial.\n\nAmazon released first-quarter results on April 30, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) shined with $25 billion in sales on 17% year-over-year growth. This is a significant acceleration over the 13% growth in Q4. When other companies budget more for data to utilize AI, AWS will benefit.\n\nFoundational models (FMs) are generative AI applications, such as chatbots, that companies can customize to fit their needs. Amazon Bedrock is such a service. Customers can choose from several FMs and run them on AWS. Amazon is also developing its own chips to accelerate AI applications.\n\nAfter its recent rise, Amazon stock is trading at its five-year average P/S ratio, but sales and profits are growing, so it is still an excellent long-term investment.\n\nThe tech industry is as diverse as ever, which is excellent for investors. The companies above are a diverse group on which investors should keep a close eye.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Warren Buffett Stock That Could Go Parabolic in 2024",
        "content": "Warren Buffett isn't known for making bold bets on fast-growing tech stocks. The billionaire investor has a reputation for sticking with companies whose earnings and cash flow trends are predictable well into the future. That's much easier to do with a company like Coca-Cola than it is for one like Nvidia.\n\nYet Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has held onto a big investment into another tech stock that, like Nvidia, is a member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Let's look at some reasons why Berkshire Hathaway might be holding onto Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as an excellent long-term growth investment.\n\nFollow the cash\n\nThe e-commerce titan's late-April earnings report was packed with good news for investors, including positive revenue trends. Amazon added $16 billion to its sales footprint in the quarter, translating into a 13% increase year over year. Cash trends were just as impressive, though, and point to potentially massive earnings growth ahead.\n\nAmazon has been cutting costs even as its sales are tilting more toward cloud services versus low-margin product sales. You can see evidence of the dramatic financial impact here in the fact that operating cash flow has nearly doubled to $99 billion over the past year.\n\nManagement focuses on long-term growth in this key financial metric, and it's clear that gains here are helping push earnings higher as well. Amazon's net income soared to $10 billion from just $3 billion in Q1. \"It was a good start to the year across the business,\" CEO Andy Jassy said, in a press release.\n\nGrowth avenues\n\nYou'd be wrong to think that this business is too big to grow. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment is booming as companies speed up their migrations to the cloud. There's even more excitement for expansion in the platform now that artificial intelligence (AI) is boosting its value.\n\nAll told, that segment accelerated to a blazing 17% growth rate last quarter, beating the pace of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. AWS is now running at a $100 billion annual sales rate.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce business has also returned to fast growth following its post-pandemic hangover. Gains here reflect the company's unmatchable scale and its huge market share in this attractive industry. Many smaller rivals, including eBay, have described challenges in keeping sales moving higher. It's great news for Amazon investors, then, that the company is still winning market share and adding to its huge industry lead.\n\nFlash sale\n\nAs Buffett likes to point out, owning a wonderful business won't do much for your portfolio if you pay too high of a price for it. That's an elevated risk for most stocks today given the market's rally over the past year. Amazon has outpaced that rally, too, soaring 80% in the last 12 months compared to a 24% increase in the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's no reason to ignore this stellar business, though. Amazon's shares are priced at 3.3 times sales, making it by far the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven on this metric. Microsoft is valued at 13 times sales, for context.\n\nAmazon isn't nearly as profitable as the software giant, of course. Compare its 8% operating profit margin with Microsoft's blazing 45% rate.\n\nIt will be a long time before Amazon's margins reach anything approaching that level. But profitability is moving in that direction as sales tilt toward the services segment. Patiently holding the stock for the next few years will allow shareholders to benefit from that positive long-term trend.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Stock Is at an Inflection Point. It's Time to Buy the Stock Like There's No Tomorrow.",
        "content": "It's clear that Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is at an inflection point. After CEO Andy Jassy took over from founder Jeff Bezos, a new emphasis on profitability and cloud computing became evident, which is a massive transformation for Amazon.\n\nGone are the days of haphazard spending on growth; instead, Amazon is growing even faster while generating record profits. Most of the market doesn't realize it yet, but Amazon is at a generational tipping point, and investors would be wise to pile into the stock before the rest of the market notices.\n\nAmazon's business is thriving at all levels\n\nAmazon's business has many moving pieces, but the least exciting is the e-commerce store. While this is the largest segment within Amazon, it's also one of the slowest growing. However, investors should pay attention to the businesses developed around its core offering.\n\nThe second-largest segment (that ties directly in with its e-commerce store) is third-party seller services. This division allows third-party sellers to sell on Amazon's platform, giving them access to Amazon's distribution warehouses and lightning-fast delivery.\n\nHowever, they have to manage inventory and determine what the consumer wants. Because they are taking on this risk, not Amazon, it's a far better business model than buying the items yourself. It also helps shield Amazon from antitrust lawsuits, as it is becoming a vital business partner for much smaller businesses.\n\nAnother exciting division is Amazon's advertising wing. This has been Amazon's fastest-growing segment for some time, and includes paying extra to have a sponsored product appear in searches and Prime Video ads.\n\nHowever, the biggest factor in Amazon's business is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is its cloud computing business. AWS was one of the first cloud computing options available to businesses and quickly shot out to a market share lead. While it has maintained that first-place position, Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud have been taking market share lately.\n\nThese two have been growing in the mid-to-high-25% range over the past year, but AWS has only been growing to the tune of around 10%. This is a problem, as it shows AWS isn't capturing much of the artificial intelligence (AI) business. However, with AWS revenue rising 17% in Q1, it's safe to say this segment is starting to boom again.\n\nWhen you look at Amazon's business as a whole, it's clear that it is booming.\n\nThe stock may be a bit expensive, but its growth backs it up\n\nWhile Amazon discloses the revenue of many of its divisions, it doesn't break out the profitability for all of them. Instead, it lumps them into three categories: North American, International, and AWS. Looking at the company this way, it's obvious that Amazon is doing well.\n\nStory continues\n\nSegment Revenue YOY Revenue Growth Operating Income YOY Operating Income Growth North American $86.3 billion 12% $5 billion 455% International $31.9 billion 10% $903 million N/A AWS $25 billion 17% $9.4 billion 84%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year. Note: International was unprofitable last year.\n\nWith all three divisions' profitability and growing at respectable rates, Amazon is a great growth stock to consider. However, you'll have to pay to own the stock. At more than 40 times earnings, Amazon isn't cheap. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe forward price-to-earnings ratio also doesn't do Amazon justice, as its profitability increases and growth goes far beyond 12 months. Thus, this metric is still slightly skewed. Still, it's something to consider before buying Amazon stock.\n\nAmazon is at an inflection point because its businesses are starting to produce massive profits. This causes its profits to grow substantially faster than revenue, which will normalize the stock's valuation over the next few quarters. As a result, I'm a buyer of Amazon's stock, as I think it can go much higher from these levels if it continues delivering stellar quarters like it did in Q1.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "40.2% of Warren Buffett's $362 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett was born in 1930, and he bought his first stock at age 11. By 1965, he was running his own investment company called Berkshire Hathaway, which he still leads today.\n\nBuffett has steered Berkshire to a total return of 4,384,748% over the last 58 years, which would have been enough to turn a $1,000 investment into more than $43.8 million. The same investment in the S&P 500 index over the same period would be worth just $312,230.\n\nBerkshire's incredible run of success stems from a simple strategy. Buffett likes to own companies with steady growth, sound profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes companies returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. One thing he has never done is chase the latest stock market trend, whether it be the internet, cloud computing, or now, artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith that said, many of the stocks owned by Berkshire have turned their attention to the AI revolution. Two of them account for a combined 40.2% of the conglomerate's $362 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities today. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nE-commerce was Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) primary business when it was founded in 1994, but the company has since expanded into cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and AI. Berkshire didn't buy Amazon stock until 2019, and Buffett has often expressed regret for not recognizing the opportunity sooner. Today, Amazon's $1.9 trillion valuation makes it the world's fifth-largest company.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud services by revenue globally. It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses thrive in the digital age, and it has also become a distribution platform for many of Amazon's AI initiatives. CEO Andy Jassy wants to dominate the three core layers of AI: infrastructure (chips and data centers), large language models (LLMs), and customer-facing AI applications.\n\nLike most cloud providers, AWS offers customers infrastructure powered by Nvidia's industry-leading graphics chips (GPUs), which were designed for processing AI workloads. However, it has also designed its own chips, and Jassy says there is strong demand for its latest Trainium 2 hardware because of its attractive pricing and performance.\n\nAWS also continues to expand its Bedrock platform, which is home to a growing number of ready-made LLMs. Building an LLM requires substantial amounts of data and financial resources, so using an existing model can accelerate the development of AI applications. Amazon built its own family of models called Titan, but AWS customers can also access models from leading start-ups like Anthropic, in which Amazon recently invested $4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo cover the third and final layer, Amazon recently launched an AI virtual assistant called Q. It's capable of analyzing the internal data of any business to provide useful insights, and it can also write, test, and debug computer code to speed up the release of new software. It's the ultimate productivity tool for AWS customers.\n\nAmazon generated $574 billion in total revenue last year, which was more than any of its tech peers in the trillion-dollar club. However, while the company has been profitable over the last three quarters, it has historically generated consistent losses because it favored investing heavily in growth. Combined with the absence of a dividend or buyback program, it doesn't tick many of Buffett's usual boxes.\n\nThat could explain why Amazon stock represents just 0.5% of Berkshire's portfolio. However, the conglomerate might wish it owned a larger stake in the coming years as the AI opportunity unfolds.\n\n2. Apple: 39.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBuffett certainly hasn't shown much hesitation when buying Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. Berkshire first invested in the iPhone maker in 2016, and it has spent around $38 billion accumulating shares since then. Thanks to a significant increase in stock price, Berkshire's stake in Apple is currently worth a whopping $143.5 billion, even after discounting the recent sale of 13% of the conglomerate's position.\n\nThe iPhone is Apple's flagship product, but it has an entire portfolio of hardware successes, including the iPad, Watch, Mac computers, and iPhone accessories like the AirPods. Apple also has a growing number of services, which include Apple Music, Apple News, Apple TV, and iCloud, to name just a few. These services are typically subscription-based and carry much higher profit margins than Apple's hardware products, so they are frequently a point of focus for investors.\n\nApple didn't become a $2.8 trillion company by standing still, and while it has been less vocal about its AI aspirations than other tech giants, it could make a significant dent on the emerging industry. There was an early clue inside the latest iPhone 15 Pro. It's fitted with a new Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which enhances the smartphone's ability to process AI workloads, like those underpinning the Siri voice assistant and autocorrect keyboard function.\n\nIn March, rumors began to fly that Apple was in partnership talks with leading developers of AI chatbots like Alphabet (Google) and OpenAI. These applications could help Apple's customers rapidly craft content, from emails to images, on their devices. They could also become virtual assistants capable of everything from answering complex questions to offering gift suggestions.\n\nIf history is any guide, Apple could charge those companies billions of dollars to have their AI chatbots installed on its 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. After all, Apple already charges Alphabet around $18 billion per year to set Google as the default search engine on its Safari browser -- a similar fee for Alphabet's Gemini chatbot would not be surprising. More will likely be revealed about Apple's AI plans at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\n\nNotably, Apple meets most of Buffett's criteria. It delivers steady revenue growth in most years, it's highly profitable, and its CEO Tim Cook regularly receives Buffett's praise. Plus, Apple pays a regular dividend, and it just announced a new stock buyback program worth $110 billion, which is the largest in corporate history.\n\nSo why did Berkshire recently sell 13% of its position in Apple? Buffett says it was for tax reasons (he speculates that corporate taxes could rise in the future), but he assured investors Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest position at the end of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy.\n\nThe advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year.\n\nAd Revenue on the Rise for Digital Advertising Companies\n\nIn recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company’s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business:\n\n“...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nSo if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.”\n\nWhile the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported an EPS of $1.13 and beat EPS expectations by $0.30. The company's revenue surged by 12.5% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and beat Wall Street consensus by $763.92 million. The company’s advertising business brought in a revenue of $11.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It’s very early for streaming TV ads but we’re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It’s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.”\n\nBarclays Identifies Microsoft's Ad Business Potential\n\nOn February 28, Barclays highlighted Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic focus on advertising investments and emphasized their significance in light of ongoing antitrust actions in the US and Europe, as well as the evolving landscape influenced by artificial intelligence, as reported by TheFly. The firm believes that the company’s advertising assets could potentially reach a value of $50 billion over time and can challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the advertisement segment. Barclays estimates the intrinsic worth of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) advertising segment at $30 billion, largely propelled by platforms like LinkedIn and Bing, and anticipates a potential $20 billion surge in sales through aggressive distribution strategies. Barclays has a Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares with a $475 price target.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings on April 25, posting an EPS of $2.94 against $2.82 expectations. Its revenue of $61.9 billion was up over 17% year-over-year, and outperformed the estimates by $971.29 million. The company’s CEO, Satya Nadella made the following comments at its Q3 2024 earnings call:\n\n“We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest-rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines, and descriptions.”\n\nKeeping in mind the recent growth in advertising and marketing industry earnings across the board, some of the best marketing stocks to buy are Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:IAS), Nexxen International Ltd. (NASDAQ:NEXN), and Boston Omaha Corporation (NYSE:BOC). 12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\n12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 30 marketing and advertising agency stocks from SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:MRAD), Yahoo Finance stock screener, and some of our prior related articles. Next, we took each stock’s analyst sentiment from The Wall Street Journal and narrowed down our list to the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside, as of May 9.\n\nHedge fund sentiment around each stock has also been added. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\n12. Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.4%\n\nOmnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is a New York-based company that provides advertising, marketing, and corporate communications services. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 27 hedge funds had stakes in the stock with total positions worth $694.181 million. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the most dominant shareholder in the company with a stake worth $244.483 million.\n\nOn May 7, Barclays upgraded Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) to Overweight from Equal Weight and increased the price target to $110 from $100. The stock has Buy-equivalent ratings as per the 11 out of 15 Wall Street analysts that have covered it over the past three months. As of May 9, the average price target of $107.58 represents an upside of 12.4% to the stock’s current price.\n\nIntegral Ad Science Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:IAS), Nexxen International Ltd. (NASDAQ:NEXN), and Boston Omaha Corporation (NYSE:BOC) are some of the best marketing stocks to buy, along with Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC).\n\nArtisan Partners made the following comment about Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is a global advertising and marketing services holding company. Organic growth came in slightly lighter than expected, which caused the stock to sell off. Even after the pullback, the stock has returned 22% over the prior one year. The business, while cyclical due to its ties to ad spend, is a royalty on competition as clients around the world seek Omnicom’s expertise in creating, managing and tracking advertising campaigns. The business generates strong free cash flow, which has funded capital return in the form of share repurchases and dividends (3.8% current dividend yield), and is mostly a cost-plus business, which lessens the risk of margin pressure. Omnicom also has a flexible cost model allowing it to cut overhead during economic downturns to protect operating profit. While we cannot predict the economic cycle, Omnicom is a business that has delivered high returns on equity over a full business cycle and is currently selling at an attractive ~12X earnings.”\n\n11. Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 15\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.57%\n\nCriteo S.A.

        "content": "Walmart WMT shares held their own in last month’s market weakness, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning, particularly relative to Target TGT and Home Depot HD.\n\nFrom the market’s March 28th peak through the end of April 2024, the S&P 500 index lost -3.8% of its value, while Walmart was down only -1.4%. Target lost -9.2% of its value during that same period, while Home Depot shares were down -12.9%.\n\nWalmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under increasing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release on Thursday, May 16th; Target reports the following week on May 22nd.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.52 in EPS on $159.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.1% and +4.5%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, so any favorable turn in the demand trends for this relatively discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target and Home Depot. Home Depot reports on Tuesday, May 14th.\n\nThe chart below shows the one-year performance of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target relative to the S&P 500 index. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTarget shares were up big following each of the preceding two reports, which assured investors about management’s ability on the margins and the ‘shrinkage issue’ they appeared to be struggling with over the last couple of years. Home Depot is a housing play and, as such, remains exposed to the seemingly higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 21 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 21 retailers that have reported are up +54.5% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 57.1% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators have struggled to exceed EPS and revenue estimates in Q1. In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.\n\nWith respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 21 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 460 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 10th. We have almost 400 companies reporting results this week, including 7 S&P 500 members. In addition to Walmart and Home Depot, this week’s line-up includes Cisco Systems, Deere & Company, China’s Alibaba, JD.com, and many others.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 460 index members are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings growth for these companies would have been +7.9% instead of +4.8% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag. The chart below puts the Q1 ex-Energy earnings growth pace in the context of other recent quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been on the weaker side for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nThe chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2024 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -1%, while the growth pace improves to +8.9% on an ex-energy basis.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9.2% on +4.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe revisions trend has been very favorable for Q2 estimates, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is the Q2 revisions trend on an ex-Energy basis Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% on +1.5% revenue growth.

        "content": "AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says\n\nThe recent earnings season has made it abundantly clear that the AI revolution is not just knocking on the door but has forcefully entered the tech world.\n\nThe impressive results from tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), AlphabetInc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) underscored this transition, according to Daniel Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush.\n\nThese companies have reported “eye-popping capital expenditure numbers,” initiating an “AI tidal wave” in software and cloud development driven by generative AI.\n\n“The next phase of AI spending is now on the doorstep for the likes of Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and many others,” Ives wrote.\n\nThe expert said companies were “laser-focused on deploying generative AI” across various sectors. Additionally, major players such as Meta and Apple were diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promised significant spending in the coming years.\n\nOther major players like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promises significant spending in the coming years.\n\nIves projected AI and related purchases will account for 8%-10% of IT budgets in 2024, a stark increase from less than 1% in 2023. This surge represented a “massive growth catalyst” in what he referred to as the “initial wave of AI software growth.”\n\nIndustry-Wide Impact and Consumer Trends\n\nIves highlighted Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft as leaders in this burgeoning field, with their influence paving the way for a trillion-dollar spending spree over the next decade.\n\nRecent consumer surveys conducted by Wedbush show “broadly positive” trends for Internet-related groups, with expectations of strong digital advertising growth in 2024.\n\n“Our findings strongly support our expectations for accelerating e-commerce and digital advertising growth in 2024,” Ives said, pointing to bullish indicators for Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft’s ‘iPhone Moment’\n\nDescribing the current phase as Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” Ives believed AI would significantly alter the cloud growth trajectory for the company in the coming years. “We see an acceleration of adoption for generative AI and Copilot activity,” he explained.\n\nThis trend is boosting Azure cloud deal flow for Microsoft, with AI use cases “exploding across the enterprise landscape.” Ives estimated that for every $100 spent on Azure cloud services, there was an additional $35-$40 of AI spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s Foray into AI\n\nLooking ahead, Ives was particularly excited about Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where he anticipates the unveiling of a comprehensive AI strategy.\n\n“We believe Apple is set to unveil its long-awaited AI strategy to its golden installed base and developer community at WWDC,” he said.\n\nThis includes a new iPad lineup and the iPhone 16, which are expected to set new standards in AI technology.\n\n“The AI strategy at Apple will consist of an AI App Store that will be the foundational starting point for developers and AI apps,” Ives said.\n\nRead Now: Utilities Notch 7th Straight Session Of Gains: ‘Potential Derivative Play To The AI Boom’\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Friday, May 10, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Visa Inc. (V) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Amazon have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+24.7% vs. +17.2%). The company’s first quarter results were driven by Prime and AWS momentum. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance.\r\n\r\nUltrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio were beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers was a positive. Robust advertising business contributed well. Notably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings remain tailwinds.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s expanding global presence remains a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Additionally, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nVisa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the year-to-date period (+7.6% vs. +5.4%). The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. It expects net revenues to increase in low double digits for fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nVisa, fueled by increased payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth. It reported strong fiscal 2Q24 results. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance.\r\n\r\nA robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challengesIt is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Pfizer have gained +0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +14.9%. The company beat first-quarter estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Pfizer’s top line is declining due to a steep drop in revenues from its COVID-19 products, the Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, due to lower demand.\r\n\r\nConcerns remain about its long-term growth drivers. Nonetheless, Pfizer expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the future quarters, driven by its in-line products like Vyndaqel and Prevnar, new launches like Abrysvo, Velsipity, Penbraya and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen.\r\n\r\nHuge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position.

        "title": "5 Stocks Driving Dow's Market-Beating Performance",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average emerged stronger than the other two major indices in the latest market rally, driven by renewed hopes of rate cuts, solid corporate earnings and increased stock buybacks. The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year.\r\n\r\nWhile 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS.\r\n\r\nThe outperformance came as the market’s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\r\n\r\nThe blue-chip index also benefited from Apple’s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\r\n\r\nAnother big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index.\r\n\r\nFurther, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nAmgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets. The stock has risen 14.5% so far this month.\r\n\r\nAmgen saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.\r\n\r\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It jumped nearly 9% over the past seven days and saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nAMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nApple designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories worldwide. The company offers iPhone, a line of smartphones, Mac, a line of personal computers, iPad, a line of multi-purpose tablets, and wearables, home, and accessories comprising AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products and HomePod. Shares of AAPL are up 8% so far this month.\r\n\r\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending September 2024) with an estimated earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nBoeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades. The company’s premier jet aircraft along with varied defense products position it as one of the largest defense contractors in the United States. It has a solid estimated earnings growth of 95.9% for this year.\r\n\r\nBoeing has risen 8% so far this month. It has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. It has risen 6.8% so far this month.\r\n\r\nGoldman saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 71 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 60.8%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 currently.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Uber Continues To Enjoy Robust Demand But Legal Bills Take A Toll On Its Bottom Line\n\nOn Tuesday, Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) posted a mixed first quarter report. Although Uber slightly surpassed revenue estimates, it posted an unexpected loss.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the three months ended on March 31st, revenue grew 15% to $10.13 billion, slightly surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $10.11 billion. Gross bookings amounted to $37.65 billion which is below StreetAccount’s estimate of $37.93 billion.\n\nThe mobility segment grew 25% YoY as gross bookings amounted to $18.67 billion with revenue rising 30% YoY as it brought in sales of $5.63 billion.\n\nThe delivery business reported gross bookings grew 18% YoY  $17.7 billion while revenue only grew 4% YoY to $3.21 billion. Uber noted that the delivery margin was harmed by business model changes.\n\nFreight business brought in $1.28 billion as it contracted 8% YoY.\n\nUnexpectedly, Uber’s net loss widened to $654 million, or a 32-cent loss per share, while LSEG expected a 23-cent loss, as long-running legal fights took a toll on its bottom line. But, adjusted EBITDA rose 82% YoY to $1.38 billion.\n\nUber gathered 149 million monthly active platform consumers, marking a YoY rise of 15%. Completed trips also rose 21% YoY to 2.6 billion.\n\nSecond Quarter Outlook\n\nFor the current quarter, Uber guided for gross bookings in the range between $38.75 billion and $40.25 billion, with StreetAccount’s estimate of $40 billion being in the upper part of the range.\n\nInstacart partnership\n\nThanks to Uber Eats, the grocery delivery company Instacart, Maplebear Inc (NASDAQ: CART), announced this week it is getting restaurant delivery. Instacart has been investing heavily in order to compete with DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT). It’s no secret that DoorDash is significantly ahead in restaurant delivery. Moreover, DoorDash can tout the growth of its grocery business which is why it is a threat for Instacart. Instacart also reported its quarterly results on the same day, that reflected a strong start of the year. Instacart posted revenue growth of 8% as sales amounted to $820 million, along with a net income of $130 million. Unlike Uber, Instacart posted an earnings beat.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment.\n\nThe interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market.

(NASDAQ:TSLA),  held 70% of the market cap last year, however, now they position in the 40% to 50% range, with names like Meta and Tesla not performing as well. He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand. He closed the interview by highlighting that if the industry is to keep progressing, NVIDIA is to keep working harder.

        "title": "Q1 2024 Arcadia Biosciences Inc Earnings Call",
        "content": "Participants\n\nThomas Schaefer; Chief Financial Officer; Arcadia Biosciences Inc\n\nStanley Jacot; President, Chief Executive Officer, Director; Arcadia Biosciences Inc\n\nBen Klieve; Analyst; Lake Street Capital Markets LLC\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for standing by. My name is Priella, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Arcadia Biosciences Q1 2024 financial results and business highlights conference call. (Operator Instructions)\r\n I would now like to turn the conference over to TJ Schaefer, Chief Financial Officer, at Arcadia, please go ahead.\n\nThomas Schaefer\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Joining me on the call today is Stan Jacot, Arcadia's President and Chief Executive Officer. This call is being webcast and you can refer to the company's press release at arcadiabio.com. Before we start, we would like to remind you that Arcadia Biosciences will be making forward-looking statements on this call based on current expectations and currently available information.\r\n However, since these statements are based on factors that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual performance and results may differ materially from those described or implied today. You can review the company's safe harbor language in our most recently filed 10-K.\r\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to Stan.\n\nStanley Jacot\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter results for 2024. Since we last talked six weeks ago, I am pleased to report that the positive business trends from Q4 2023 have continued in Q1 2024. Revenue continues to grow both sequentially and year over year. Our gross profit margins have been greater than 30% for five consecutive quarters. Operating expenses continue to decline at a double-digit pace versus last year. All of these factors have contributed to Q1 2024 achieving a lowest loss from continuing operations in over six years.\r\n Let's now turn our attention to GoodWheat. The GoodWheat brand continues to expand with Q1, adding a couple of hundred stores of distribution on pancake and waffle mixes. Our focus continues to be nurturing our existing points of distribution and building success stories by category. There are plans in place for each customer addressing everyday pricing, promoted pricing, shelf placement, fuel expansion and account-specific marketing. These plans will require significant expense to execute but are necessary in order to achieve brand scale and defend shelf space from fierce competition.\r\n On our last call, I mentioned several accolades, our GoodWheat brand had received from some significant publications, including Better Homes and Gardens and the website, [Eat This, Not That]. And I want to share another activity that could we have received from a customer. In Q1, we launched GoodWheat mac and cheese nationwide on Amazon and three varieties, Classic Cheddar, White Cheddar and Three Cheese.\r\n At Amazon recently selected GoodWheat, Three Cheese, Mac and Cheese as an Amazon choice new arrival pick. This designation is solely driven by Amazon's criteria, which includes being highly rated well priced and available to ship immediately. This is one more example from an independent source that proves that we already know that our proprietary wheat is commercially viable to create great-tasting products while sneaking in more fiber and protein.\r\n To reiterate our business model includes expanding the use of our technology into food products beyond GoodWheat. There are thousands of products across the grocery store and in foodservice that can offer the same valuable benefits. So we see a long-term path to generate recurring royalty revenue. We have been actively pursuing two key steps to monetizing this technology one partner with a wheat supply chain in order to produce a scalable, cost-effective identity preserved resupply.\r\n We need our wheat technology integrated into all customer preferred wheat varieties and then efficiently move from seed to farm to mills to deliver cloud. We are currently in final discussions with potential partners and hope to update you soon.\r\n In parallel the second step is to work with large food manufacturers to create a demand for our wheat, this can create a long term pull through partnerships to ensure we have enough volume through our supply chain system. Conversations are underway across several categories and will take some time to develop products with their R&D groups.\r\n Now let's move to Zola coconut water. The coconut water categories continued to perform well in Q1 2024, with unit sales and dollar sales both increasing 10% versus a year ago. According to Nielsen data for the 13 weeks ending March 30, 2024. Zillow momentum is continuing in the latest four weeks ending March 30, 2024, so Zola growing 15% in dollar sales and 14% in unit sales.\r\n Zola it is back to growing share in the category and we are optimistic that this double-digit growth will continue in 2024 for a couple of reasons. One, our flavor innovation will begin shipping in Q2, adding more variety to Zola's naturally hydrating lineup, original line in pineapple flavors and then it was 16.9 ounce resealable tetra pack container have been well received by retailers as pineapple is the number one coconut water flavor and lime is the number one flavor in sparkling water.\r\n Two, we have confirmed several new accounts that we will be adding a lot to their single-serve beverage set in the produce section. The store count for this new distribution of nearly 1,300 stores, bringing our total store count facility over 3,300 by the end of Q2. Our focus will be to ensure these new stores can quickly achieve the same velocity and dollar sales as our current retailers enjoy. So we expect that to be a key growth driver for us in the future for both revenue and gross profit, and we will continue to explore the next wave have consumer-preferred innovation.\r\n Last initiative to discuss today is the strategic review announced last year, which stated that Arcadia would explore a range of strategic options, which could include an asset sale acquisition, merger sale or other strategic transaction. Since that time we've allowed our bankers have engaged with a significant number of potential transaction partners to find the best outcome for Arcadia and our shareholders.\r\n And while we operate and provide a detailed update today, we continue to have discussions and performed the due diligence work necessary to accelerate our ability to monetize our IP and deliver cash flow positive results. We will keep you updated as material events occur, and we must point out that there can be no assurance that this exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the company entering or completing any transaction and no timetable has been set for the conclusion of the strategic review.\r\n As discussed on our last call, we anticipated our 2024 net operating loss to be under $10 million for the first time in the company's history. Our Q1 performance and trend has met our expectation in order to deliver that objective, and we plan to grow revenue, optimize margins and reduce operating expenses for the remainder of 2024 in order to achieve this goal.\r\n With that, I'll turn the call over to TJ, to discuss our Q1 financial results. TJ?\n\nStory continues\n\nThomas Schaefer\n\nThank you, Stan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that all comparisons to our prior year results exclude the impact of our body care brands, which were discontinued in September 2023.\r\n With that, let me walk through our results for the first quarter of 2024. Revenues of approximately $1.3 million, increased 7% sequentially and 2% compared to the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter improvement was attributable to a 28% increase in Zola as Q4 is seasonally the softest quarter for coconut water. Our year-over-year growth was primarily driven by GoodWheat and Zola sales, partially offset by higher costs associated with new distribution.\r\n Gross profit of $435,000 was slightly below the prior quarter and prior year due to product mix, but still resulted in a very healthy gross margin of 35%. And as Stan mentioned earlier, this is our fifth consecutive quarter delivering gross margins in excess of 30%, which is a testament to the progress we have made in delivering high-quality revenue.\r\n Research and development expenses of $272,000 declined 18% quarter over quarter and 24% year over year due to the timing of innovation work following the launch of new GoodWheat categories as well as new Zola flavors.\r\n Selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.2 million decreased 7% versus Q4 2023 and 22% compared to the same period last year as we rightsized the organization and our marketing investments. Total operating expenses of $3.5 million improved 9% sequentially and 21% year over year, resulting in a loss from continuing operations of approximately $3.1 million, which is the lowest level in the past six years.\r\n From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $8.5 million in cash and short-term investments, which is $3.1 million below our Q4 2023 ending balance. As we stated on our last earnings call, we believe our use of cash will be in the single digits, and we continue to hold to that guidance. However, our use of cash will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, driven by larger cash payments related to employee bonuses and insurance.\r\n Our inventory balance stood at $5 million at the end of Q1 2024, of which 84% was GoodWheat. We will continue to work down these balances as we focus on driving velocities in existing stores versus new distribution.\r\n In summary, Q1 continued the positive momentum we've achieved over the past few quarters. Our revenue grew quarter over quarter and year over year. We have achieved gross margins in excess of 30% for five straight quarters. At the same time, we have reduced our operating expenses by 21% or nearly $1 million, which has resulted in our loss from continuing operations being at the lowest level in six years, and we estimate our use of cash to be in the single digits for the first time since Arcadia went public in 2015.\r\n So while we still have plenty of work to do in order to achieve positive cash flow results and deliver value to our shareholders, we are very pleased with the progress we made in Q1.\r\n I will now turn the call over to the operator questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions)\r\n Ben Klieve, Lake Street.\n\nBen Klieve\n\nThanks, for taking my questions. First a couple of questions around the expenses associated with the GoodWheat expansion that you both noted in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering, first, if you can kind of help characterize the magnitude of the associated expenses and impact on gross profit from during the first quarter?\n\nStanley Jacot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ben, for calling in, and I'm actually to turn that over to TJ to answer that question.\n\nThomas Schaefer\n\nYeah. Ben, so a lot of the upfront investment is around promotions and slotting, but as we've noted previously, our overall marketing investment will come down significantly relative to prior quarters or prior years, as we focus more on our existing customers and again, driving those velocities versus new distribution into new stores.\n\nBen Klieve\n\nOkay. That's helpful. I think you've kind of answered my follow-up question, but I will ask it anyway here. Around kind of the trajectory of these costs throughout this year. So it sounds like you're saying you think the costs associated with all these initiatives that you've outlined today are going to be potentially ramping down here into the second, third quarter or they're going to stay at the kind of a consistent run rate from first quarter levels?\n\nStanley Jacot\n\nYes, Daniel, it will probably start to ramp down by Q4.\n\nBen Klieve\n\nOkay. Very good. That's helpful. Thanks, Stan. And then the you talked about your focus on kind of nurturing existing retail relationships. Today, something you've talked about for the past couple of quarters has been a focus throughout 2024. I'm wondering if you could just talk on a high level about kind of the early results thus far in this process. Are you happy with the kind of progression of the relationship that you have with your existing retailers or the things that are going uniquely well, or there challenges that are still in place? There's anything you can elaborate on regarding the strategy would be great.\n\nStanley Jacot\n\nI'd say the results are mixed Ben. We do have some high spots with some retailers, but there are some retailers were really still struggling to execute the plan that we've laid out. And again, there's a variety of reasons behind it differs by account, sometimes it's a change in the buyers, sometimes it's real resistance to either changing the planogram or adding SKUs other times, it's the difficulty in securing promoted prices. So that it's -- but I would say it's mixed at this point, it is difficult and competitive in these markets.\n\nBen Klieve\n\nYeah. That's fair enough, there's no doubt about that. Okay, very good. We'll look forward to updates on that on that in coming quarters. And then on last one for me is on Zola. You guys seem pretty enthusiastic about the opportunity here from it's been your both the SKU count with new flavors and also expansion of single-serve. Can you kind of characterize the your vision for Zola progression here throughout this year and especially into 2025, as all of these initiatives begin to scale. I mean, is this something that's going to be the ultimate I'm trying to understand if Zola is going to be really a revenue driver above and beyond GoodWheat here in coming quarters, given these initiatives.\n\nStanley Jacot\n\nI think that's a fair characterization that Zola is going to be the majority driver of revenue and in particular, gross profit growth and part of the reason for that is because the growth that we have in Zola, doesn't come with the same kinds of costs. It's a much different category in that protein set in terms of selling dollars required in promoted dollars required.\n\nBen Klieve\n\nGot it. Okay, very good. Well, best of luck, rolling those initiatives that a dollar. Thanks for taking my questions. And I'll get back to you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to you Stanley Jacot, for closing remarks.\n\nStanley Jacot\n\nThank you. So in conclusion, our Arcadia continuing its positive trajectory. We have transitioned the top line to high-quality revenue, that generates gross profit across multiple sources. We have rightsized the organization and streamlined our cost structure in order to extend our runway. Our GoodWheat is in more than 35 hundred stores in three categories and Zola coconut water is positioned for double digit growth with new flavors and new distribution.\r\n And finally, we remain focused on monetizing our IP and accelerating delivery of cash flow positive results. We look forward to updating you in the future. Thanks again for joining us and have a great rest of your day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call and thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Overlooked AI Gems: 3 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Potential",
        "content": "Everyone who has tried generative AI knows it’s a transformational technology. And it isn’t a fad; artificial intelligence will be with us for decades. Let’s highlight some under-the-radar AI stocks to profit from this revolution.\n\nInvestors have increased their exposure to AI investments as the payoffs of the innovation become clearer. A major focus has been on semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and software stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While these industries might still have more upside, the AI impact is likely priced in.\n\nInstead, other companies in adjacent industries could have material upside as AI investment goes into overdrive. During Q1 2024 earnings, hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) disclosed increasing their capital expenditures to support their AI efforts. These capex plans have a straightforward implication: a multi-year AI data center buildout.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis capital expenditure bodes well for these under-the-radar AI stocks whose products go into AI data centers. Their products are integral in supporting the AI revolution.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne major investment area triggered by AI is the buildout of data centers. According to McKinsey estimates, U.S. demand based on power consumption could grow from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 35 GW by 2030. This creates an upside for one of the under-the-radar AI stocks, Vertiv (NYSE:VRT).\n\nDue to the significant computations, AI data centers run hot. That’s why Vertiv’s solutions are key to data center players. The company provides a portfolio of power, cooling and IT infrastructure solutions geared to this industry. For instance, it offers a range of data center cooling solutions to maintain optimal temperature levels.\n\nIndeed, Vertiv is heavily exposed to the data center at 75% of revenues. Furthermore, it is banking on its decades of experience serving the segment. Therefore, management is confident that they will capitalize on the AI trend.\n\nNotably, the company saw 60% organic order growth related to large-scale AI data center projects in Q1 2024. Pipeline velocity surged in the quarter, leading to an $800 million backlog increase, pushing the total to a record $6.3 billion.\n\nDue to the robust demand, Vertiv is ramping up production. Management expects expanding demand as larger projects come online. It will be a top beneficiary as a key supplier of cooling solutions for data centers.\n\nCummins (CMI) A Cummins sign in bright red.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cummings (NYSE:CMI) is mainly an engine and commercial components provider, it is one of the best under-the-radar AI stocks to buy. That’s because it’s one of the primary providers of backup power generators necessary to keep data centers running.\n\nData centers need reliable power at all times. Cummings provides a range of power generators that guarantee unlimited operation hours without limit on the average variable load factor. These backup solutions are critical, especially during power grid outages.\n\nDue to the robust demand, Cummings posted a 21% revenue increase in the North American power generation segment. Similarly, it revealed accelerating data center demand in the Chinese market.\n\nIn the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the robust demand from the data center market. CEO Jennifer Rumsey said they expect power generation revenues to increase 10% to 15% in 2024. She cited the data center market as the main driver and noted that some products were sold out through 2025.\n\nDemand for data center power generation solutions is surging. In line with this, Cummings has increased its revenue growth guidance for the power generation segment from 5%—10% to 10%—15%. This increased optimism makes CMI stock a top buy.\n\nEaton (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nEaton (NYSE:ETN) will be another beneficiary as the data center buildout to support AI innovation accelerates. According to Goldman Sachs, data center power demand will grow at a 15% compounded annual growth rate between 2023 and 2030. This will spur demand for the power distribution and backup power protection equipment Eaton offers for data centers.\n\nToday, Eaton’s equipment is integral to multi-tenant and hyperscale data centers, making it among the best under-the-radar AI stocks. For instance, most data centers use their power distribution equipment, which includes panelboards, switchgear, busways and transformers.\n\nEaton provided an update on the AI data center market after impressive Q1 2024 results. Management expects the market to grow at a 25% CAGR between 2022 and 2025. Additionally, they noted Eaton’s strong position in this market, which accounted for 14% of total revenues in 2023.\n\nRegarding forward growth, CEO Craig Arnold highlighted that orders had doubled over the trailing 12-month period. He also noted that the company had a strong negotiating pipeline. In the quarter, the project negotiation pipeline increased 169% year-over-year.\n\nThese solid fundamentals point to the momentum from AI data center growth driven by AI, big data and edge computing. The secular growth in data center demand makes Eaton one of the top under-the-radar AI stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "The auto sector is entering an exciting and more lucrative era. That’s because automakers are starting to charge subscription fees for high-tech services. I believe that these companies will soon also start offering to track the well-being of various components within vehicles in exchange for fees. Which may transform them into the one of the best auto stocks investors want to buy. Of course, for the owners of electric vehicles, keeping informed about the welfare and needs of their EV’s batteries is extremely important. As a result, I’m sure that many owners will be willing to pay to stay on top of those matters.\n\nImportantly, most consumers seem willing to pay monthly fees for services within their vehicles. But they often like to try out these services first. In July 2023, S&P polled roughly 4,500 consumers who had a free trial or a subscription for services within their vehicles. More than 80% of the respondents said they would consider purchasing subscription-based services in the future. For investors who want to profit from this trend, here are the three best auto stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nModern electric vehicles are much more computerized than their gas-powered counterparts. Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) CEO Peter Rawlinson explained in 2021 that computing has become central to vehicles, especially EVs. As a result, it’s much easier to offer software-based services through EVs than gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, automakers that sell many EVs will be much better positioned to offer software subscriptions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmong the veteran automakers, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the best positioned firms to become a top seller of EVs. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV jumped 500% last quarter year-over-year to 5,800. The Chevrolet Bolt was a top-selling EV in the U.S before it was taken off the market. However, GM is slated to release a retooled version of the Bolt next year. Moreover, the automaker has begun selling electric versions of many of its most popular trucks and SUVs. I believe that these will become best sellers in the longer term. Boding well for the future, GM expects its North American EV business to enter the black in the second half of this year.\n\nFinally, GM reported very strong first-quarter results, has a very low valuation, and is returning a great deal of cash to its shareholders.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHow can anyone not love a company that’s an integral partner of both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt appears that EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) could be on the verge of achieving that huge milestone. As of last October, the start-up had provided Amazon with 10,000 of the delivery vans that the e-commerce giant has ordered. And tech website DigiTimes recently reported that Apple is considering forming a partnership with Rivian.\n\nSuch an alliance would certainly make sense for Apple. Obviously, the software behemoth is interested in selling products via EVs. And Rivian is one of the top American EV-oriented firms.\n\nMeanwhile, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe did not deny that the automaker could partner with Apple. He even noted that his company has a history of partnerships. Given these points, I think there’s a very high chance of the two firms forming an alliance. Such a deal should prove to be very lucrative for Rivian.\n\nVinFast (VFS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of Vietnamese car manufacturer VinFast (VFS) on screen in front of business web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) is a Vietnam-based EV startup that’s growing very rapidly and has a semi-secret weapon. Last quarter the company’s sales soared 270% YOY to $302.65 million. Meanwhile, its EV deliveries jumped 444% YOY to 9,689.\n\nThe automaker’s semi-secret weapon is its alliance with Israeli EV battery maker StoreDot. The company’s batteries will be utilized by VinFast’s commercially available vehicles starting next year.\n\nAnother EV maker, Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY), recently reported that a test they conducted showed that StorDot’s battery can add 200 miles worth of charge in just 10 minutes.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in RIVN and AMZN.The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

Reintjes\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning. YETI delivered a great start to 2024 as evidenced by our strong first quarter results. We saw positive global demand for our brand and our broadening range of products, and we had great execution across multiple fronts, driving double-digit growth in both our wholesale and DTC channels as well as our Coolers & Equipment and Drinkware categories. \r\nOur wholesale performance was supported by sell-in and sell-through relative to the year ago period, while our DTC business showed continued growth across e-commerce, corporate sales, Amazon and YETI retail. \r\nIn Coolers, with our new innovation and expanded awareness campaign, we believe we are well positioned for the upcoming seasonal demand. In Drinkware, our range of bottles and tumblers continue to deliver strength within the category. \r\nBy geography, International growth exceeded 30% year-over-year to reach a YETI high of 19% of total sales, even as our domestic growth was nearly 10%. Behind the strength of the brand, the growing product portfolio and global expansion, we are on track to deliver on our full year top-line outlook. \r\nGiven the combination of inbound freight recovery, product cost improvements driven by outstanding work by our supply chain and operations team and strong price discipline, we're pleased to report profitability to build upon our historical strength, delivering a 450 basis point improvement in gross margins. Following our top-line performance and gross margin strength, our adjusted operating margin also expanded by 440 basis points for the period. \r\nIn the quarter, we also delivered on our capital allocation priorities, starting with the completion of our Mystery Ranch and Butter Pat acquisitions. Our integration of these businesses is on track as we accelerate our mid- and long-term opportunities in bags and cookware. \r\nFinally, we announced a $100 million accelerated share repurchase plan in late-February, which was fully executed last month. \r\nFrom a top-line perspective, we remain optimistic on our demand drivers for the full year. We expect sales performance consistent with our original guidance, as we balance performance against anticipated ongoing conservative purchasing at higher price points, balanced channel sell-in and demand and are compared against headwinds as a result of last year's recall-related gift card redemptions. \r\nLooking at our bottom line, we are raising our outlook to reflect our margin strength and the execution of our ASR. As previously indicated, we will continue to evaluate thoughtful and strategic capital allocation opportunities in the quarters ahead. \r\nTurning to our growth strategy in 2024 and beyond. Our priority remains to extend brand reach and engagement, drive product diversification across our portfolio, leverage our powerful omnichannel to reach customers and build our global business. \r\nShifting to our brand reach. Q1 highlighted the ongoing evolution of YETI's breadth and depth brand strategy. In the early months of 2024, we have activated alongside some of our larger global partnerships. \r\nIn the second year of our partnership with the World Surf League, we became the presenting partner for the first event of the season, the YETI Pro pipeline in Oahu. On the Mountain, our activation included continued events such as natural selection. Finally, in Formula One racing, our partnership with RedBull Racing is proving to find creative ways for YETI to integrate and support the team. \r\nWe also established a new partnership in the world of professional soccer with a club looking to disrupt the status quo. In March, the Kansas City Current debuted the world's first stadium built specifically for a women's pro sports team. We're incredibly proud to support the Current, their visionary ownership and the team's efforts to elevate the profile of both the sport and these incredible professional athletes. We look forward to the many innovative ways we will connect our brands. \r\nOur community marketing efforts, combined with the amazing work our team does on the brand side, showed how we grow, develop and connect our global audiences. Fitness was a natural place to start the year, highlighting the work our ambassadors put in before heading out to the wild, and the YETI gear that gets them through it all. We expanded our health and fitness efforts this year, with brand placement in nearly 1,300 gyms across the country. \r\nNext, we focused on highlighting our expanded Drinkware offerings in coffee, driving awareness, reach and relevance for new and existing global customers. As you may have seen this week, we added to the portfolio a new YETI French press that can double as a beverage pitcher, as we look to release the stand-alone pitcher later this summer. \r\nYETI also received 2 incredible brand accolades during the quarter that speak to the passion, talent and creativity of our team. Ad Age is 2024 In-House Agency of the Year and Fast Company's most innovative companies in PR and brand strategies. These affirmations, while not the goal, are a testament to the energy, realness and humanity that the team puts into our brand. This is what creates the emotional connection and sustainable passion for what we do. \r\nThis isn't about a moment. It's about growing a movement towards reconnection of people and community to the wild. I want to thank the entire YETI team for their belief in pouring themselves into this against a market backdrop that at times is more focused on buzz. This brand has been built on consistently and sustainably engaging customers and communities showing up in real ways and staying true to the spirit of what YETI is, all while growing and evolving globally. \r\nTo that end, in the current quarter and throughout 2024, we will find moments to engage new and existing customers from spring travel to gift-giving occasions, to the start of summer, with incredible story to tell the people in places that support our expanding product assortment. \r\nAs we shift to product, there are 3 key themes this year: a focus on growth in our cooler family, the evolution of YETI into broader food and beverage and the product expansion potential under the YETI brand umbrella and brand-building playbook. \r\nAcross our product range, we're in a great position to capitalize on the warmer weather in the beginning of summer travel and outdoor activities. We're leveraging a few key demand drivers as we head into the season: innovation, awareness and conversion. \r\nWe're excited about the next wave of hard cooler innovation in 2024, building upon our legacy dating back to our first hard cooler in 2006. Recently, we debuted our Roadie 32-cooler, our smallest and most portable wheel cooler to date. The Roadie was designed to pull up to a camp site, move through a tailgate or handle weekend tournaments. \r\nLater this summer, we plan to introduce a personal-sized hard cooler, which will anchor at the entry price point for YETI hard coolers at $200. Think of this as a good day out type cooler that will work well in a side-by-side on a golf cart or on the job. \r\nOn the Drinkware side, we're seeing a great response to our deep portfolio of 50-plus offerings across our premium range of bottles and tumblers. This is part of our growth and expansion strategy as we support more moments in their day. We are evolving this category and building out solutions to address what we see as consumer needs and opportunities. \r\nFor instance, the previously announced french press and pitcher complement last year's beverage bucket and wine chiller, and are a sign of the evolution and the opportunity. Additionally, after years of requests from our customers, we will launch a couple of highly giftable barware items in limited supply and time for Father's Day. \r\nTo round out the 2024 offerings, we also plan to introduce our first YETI cast iron cookware later this summer. Outside of Coolers and Drinkware, we're excited by the prospects of what we see as possible in bags, cargo and the expanding group of offerings under our Coolers & Equipment family. We expect to deliver innovation across this entire range, starting with our flagship dry bag expansion earlier this year, following last year's addition of new waterproof dustproof cargo boxes. There's more to come around this. \r\nWe continue to be focused on driving awareness in top of mind for YETI. We're deploying a range of brand efforts across TV, digital, print and out-of-home, to keep the brand and product in front of the consumer. This includes an incredible partnership with our wholesalers to drive awareness during those important moments as we launch new products. \r\nAdditionally, we're using a broad range of direct performance marketing programs focused on driving consumers towards conversion. Through these expanded efforts in innovation and marketing, we will continue to deliver integrated storytelling that connects people and products, highlighted at times with color inspiration from the wild. \r\nAs we see opportunities to reach more customers, engage them in impactful ways and tell powerful brand and product stories, we're also focused on strengthening our global go-to-market. Our strong and diverse channels to market are a key contributor to the balanced growth achieved in the first quarter, and speak to the consistency and power of YETI. \r\nTurning to our DTC performance. We saw the benefits of customer value in UPT against a some more challenging traffic and customer count, as we lap the start of last year's recall and our selected end-of-life transitions. Our Amazon marketplace remained consistently strong as we see that customer loyalty to the channel, further supporting our strategy of diverse channels to market. \r\nCorporate sales delivered strong order volume and inbound demand. The addition of more efficient and cost-effective printing technology for hard coolers underscores our continuous improvement efforts, delivering value for the customer and YETI. \r\nWe opened the newest locations of our YETI retail stores in the Woodlands outside of Houston and in New York City's Flatiron District. Our stores continue to provide a singularly unique opportunity to see the depth and breadth of YETI's product offering, engage with product experts, learn and shop. We are targeting to open 6 total locations this year, including the upcoming openings in Kansas City and Calgary, which would bring our fleet total to 24. \r\nIn our wholesale channel, we saw positive demand across categories, further supported by better sell-in compared to last year's period. Channel inventory is in good shape, as our partners continue to lean into seasonal colors and remain bullish on product releases we have planned throughout 2024 and into 2025. \r\nAs previously outlined, we are thoughtfully expanding our global wholesale reach, including the already announced partner in Tractor Supply in the U.S., combined with new partners in Canada, Australia and Europe. In addition, we also continue to cultivate new wholesale partnerships that align with our increasingly diverse product assortment. \r\nAs we shift to our non-U.S. business, I'd like to provide some color on how we're building out our global leadership to support our focus and growth in these areas. Naoji Takeda joined YETI recently as our new Managing Director, Asia. Naoji most recently comes from KEEN, the outdoor footwear brand, where he held a variety of global and regional roles, including leading the brand's growth in Japan and throughout Asia Pacific. With his experience in passion-based and innovative brands, I'm excited to see him take on the immense opportunity we have in the region. \r\nLooking at the overall international business. We continue to see strong momentum for the brand and incredible opportunity in undeveloped markets. In addition to solidifying our regional structure, our near-term focus is on growing brand awareness and building our successful omnichannel approach. \r\nIn Europe, overall brand traction is outstanding as we see strong results in the U.K. and Germany as well as other markets throughout Europe. It has been increasingly fun to see YETI show up from the countryside to the city streets as we activate the brand. Supporting this momentum, we're making key investments in our team, the brand and processes to scale the business. This includes the transition of our U.K. 3PL this month, which will support future growth, while also driving improved speed to market and operational efficiency. \r\nIn Australia, we had another incredible quarter. Our team in Australia continues to show that the YETI growth playbook travels even as they contribute to making a stronger and nuance to the market. We really like the balance we have in Australia with powerful independent retailers all the way up to our partnership with outdoor leader, BCF. We will also begin testing a new partnership with a sporting goods retailer as we focus on reaching customers deeper into urban markets. \r\nFrom a product offering perspective, we see great traction across the portfolio with customization capabilities and demand, much like we have seen in North America. In Canada, growth was supported by strong wholesale sell-through despite some of the same channel caution that we have seen domestically. Within wholesale, we're beginning to test several new targeted relationships that will complement our channels to market and allow us to reach new consumers in different buying moments. \r\nOn the DTC side, we've seen strength in our emerging corporate sales business, and are excited about the opportunity to scale customization to support both the customer and corporate demand. \r\nIn closing, I want to take a quick moment and highlight a particularly important event for the company, our recent YETI round up in April. Once a year, we bring together our global team at our Austin headquarters for a week of immersion, learning and connection. This is a powerful way to stoke the brand and keep connected to our growing global team. \r\nI always come away from this week energized and with an incredible appreciation for our team and what they are creating here at YETI. Importantly, it solidifies my unwavering conviction in the long-term untapped growth opportunities ahead for this brand. \r\nBefore handing the call over to Mike to review our financials and outlook, I want to thank our outstanding customers, partners and friends who show up for YETI every day at every launch and in every new market we enter. This is what drives us forward. \r\nNow I will turn the call over to Mike.\n\nStory continues\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a few comments on the impact of certain strategic actions on our GAAP results, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results. I'll then provide an overview of our performance in Q1 across our non-GAAP measures. Finally, I will give some details on our updated fiscal 2024 outlook before opening it up for your questions. \r\nOur GAAP results for the first quarter of 2024 include the impact of 2 items that I would call out for you all this quarter. 1, transition costs associated with our recent acquisitions, including the impact of purchase accounting on our gross margins; and 2, costs associated with the closure of our Vancouver design center. While we were pleased with the work that our team in Vancouver was delivering, the acquisition of Mystery Ranch provided an opportunity to consolidate this work into 1 location in Bozeman, Montana. The impact of these and other items is excluded from our non-GAAP results. \r\nPer our normal practice, our results discussed on this call will be on an adjusted non-GAAP basis in order to better focus on the operational performance of the company during the period. \r\nNow moving on to the details of the quarter. First quarter sales increased 13% to $341 million. As Matt detailed, our strong performance was balanced across categories, channels and geographies. These results include the initial contributions from Mystery Ranch and $2 million of gift card redemptions related to remedies offered to customers impacted by the product recall. We are pleased with the progress we have made to integrate our recent acquisitions, and they are on track to generate approximately 200 basis points of top-line growth for YETI in 2024. \r\nBy category, Drinkware sales increased 13% to $215 million. Our performance was driven by a number of factors, including a portfolio of over 50 products that we continue to expand, exceptional growth outside the United States and continued strong customer demand for color and customization on a global basis. \r\nHere are a few specific examples of products that drove our growth in Q1. We launched a new lineup of 3 stackable tumblers that offer our customers the same great performance, with added functionalities such as improved space saving, hand fit and cup holder compatibility. The products that we launched last Q4 continued to gain traction, including our smaller coffee specialty sizes, our 42-ounce straw mug and our cocktail shaker. We had a great quarter in bottles driven by the wide range of sizes, materials and lid options that we offer our customers. And we remain excited by the growth of our tabletop and barware offerings such as the beverage bucket and wine chiller. \r\nCoolers & Equipment sales increased 15% to $120 million. Both hard coolers and soft coolers posted growth for the period. We are excited to now have our full assortment of products available in the market, including in seasonal colors. And we continue to add to this product lineup with the recent innovation in hard coolers that Matt mentioned. While we do continue to expect to see some pressure on higher price point items as we go through this year, we believe we are in a strong position to win in coolers as we head into the peak summer months. \r\nBeyond coolers, we saw strong organic performance from our legacy YETI bags lineup, led by our Panga waterproof line and the expansion of our SideKick Dry Gear Case line. The category also benefited from the inclusion of Mystery Ranch, which was on plan for the quarter. \r\nFrom a channel perspective, direct-to-consumer sales grew 12% to $188 million, representing 55% of total sales, driven by growth in both Drinkware and C&E. Additionally, we drove solid growth across each of our DSC channels during the period, including e-commerce, corporate sales and Amazon. \r\nWhile still a relatively small contributor, we were also pleased with the growth of YETI Retail. As Matt mentioned, we are modestly accelerating our new store plans this year, as we look to expand our reach and provide more opportunities for consumers to experience the full breadth of our product assortment. \r\nWholesale sales increased 13% to $154 million, driven by growth in both C&E and Drinkware. Importantly, sell-through for both product categories was positive and our channel inventory levels remain in good position. \r\nOutside the U.S., sales grew 32% to $66 million, representing 19% of total sales, driven by outsized growth in Europe and Australia. The opportunity outside the United States remain significant as we look to drive brand awareness, expand our wholesale footprint and leverage our full set of D2C capabilities. \r\nGross profit increased 22% to $196 million or 57.5% of sales compared to 53% in the same period last year. Positive drivers of this 450 basis point increase include 370 basis points from lower inbound freight and 190 basis points from lower product costs. These gains were partially offset by 60 basis points from higher customization costs given the continued growth of our custom business, 20 basis points from strategic price decreases on certain hard coolers that we implemented during the quarter and 30 basis points from all other impacts. \r\nSG&A expenses for the quarter increased 13% to $157 million and remained flat at 45.9% of sales. Non-variable expenses increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales, offset by variable expenses decreasing 10 basis points as a percent of sales. Within non-variable, higher employee costs and marketing expenses were offset by lower warehousing costs. \r\nOperating income increased 82% to $40 million or 11.6% of sales, an increase of 440 basis points over the 7.2% that we reported in the prior year period. Net income increased 89% to $29 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to $0.18 in the prior year period. \r\nTurning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $174 million in cash compared to $168 million in the year ago period. The decline in cash on a sequential basis was driven by our accelerated share repurchase agreement, the acquisitions of Mystery Ranch and Butter Pat and the normal seasonality of our cash and working capital. \r\nInventory increased 5% year-over-year to $364 million. We expect year-end inventory to generally grow in the range of sales, but there may be quarters this year, where it grows at a faster rate than sales as we build inventory ahead of new product launches. \r\nTotal debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing fees and finance leases, was $81 million compared to $84 million at the end of last year's first quarter. During the quarter, we made a principal payment of $1 million on our term loan. \r\nNow turning to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We continue to expect full year sales to increase between 7% and 9% compared to fiscal 2023's adjusted net sales, inclusive of approximately 200 basis points of contribution from our 2 acquisitions. As we previously indicated, we expected a stronger growth rate in the first quarter. \r\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect relatively balanced growth across the upcoming quarters, with Q2 plan slightly below our growth rate in the second half of this year. There are a number of compare dynamics to consider this year, including gift card redemptions, which we will start to compare against in Q2. The largest impact from prior-year gift card redemptions will be in the second quarter, when we saw $12.5 million worth of redemptions in the prior-year quarter. \r\nWe are reiterating our expectations for growth across channels, categories and geographies. By channel, we expect balanced growth between wholesale and D2C. By category, Coolers & Equipment is expected to outpace Drinkware, given both the return of our full soft cooler lineup and the incremental sales of Mystery Ranch products. And we expect International growth of between 20% and 25% compared to Domestic growth in the mid-single-digit range. As a final comment on sales, consistent with last quarter, we continue to take a prudently conservative approach to how we plan the remainder of the year. \r\nMoving down the P&L. Supported by our strong performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our 2024 gross margin target to approximately 58% compared to our original target of approximately 57.5%, and up from 56.9% last year. This increase is due to slight benefits across a number of drivers within our gross margin line versus one single factor. The ongoing recovery of inbound freight costs remains the largest driver of our year-over-year gross margin expansion this year, but we do continue to see some offsetting rate pressure due to the Red Sea conflict. \r\nFrom a phasing perspective, we expect margin expansion to start to ease in Q2 versus the significant increases we have seen over the past 4 quarters. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to have largely comp the benefit of lower inbound freight costs. Thus, our gross margins in the second half will be much more in line with the prior year. But over the long term, we still see opportunities to continue to expand our gross margins through drivers such as sales mix, product cost savings and other supply chain efficiencies. \r\nWith the increase in our gross margin outlook, we are also raising the high end of our operating income outlook. We now expect adjusted operating margin of between 16% and 16.5%, up from our prior outlook of approximately 16% and compared to 15.6% in fiscal 2023. On a quarterly basis, we expect operating income growth to be roughly in line with sales growth. \r\nAs we have discussed previously, we will continue to use a portion of our gross margin upside to incrementally invest in our business. These investment areas include our global expansion efforts, our D2C business, and support for inorganic opportunities. Therefore, while full year SG&A is expected to grow at the high end of our sales range, the timing of investments may drive some variability in our SG&A growth rate on a quarter-to-quarter basis. More importantly, our focus is on delivering our top and bottom line outlook for the year and on driving top line growth over the long term. \r\nBelow the operating line, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25.3% for the year, slightly above the 24.8% rate in 2023. As we disclosed in an 8-K filing, we entered into a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement during Q1. That contract fully executed as of April 22, and thus, we expect full year diluted shares outstanding of approximately 86.1 million. Due to this lower share count and raising the high end of our operating income range, we now expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to increase 11% to 16% to between $2.49 and $2.62 compared to $2.25 in fiscal 2023. \r\nAs for cash, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $60 million and free cash flow of between $100 million and $150 million this year. We will remain opportunistic going forward as we look to deploy cash between M&A and further share buybacks. As a reminder, we have $200 million remaining on our most recent share buyback authorization. \r\nIn summary, we were pleased with our first quarter execution. We delivered balanced top-line growth across the business, continue to improve our profitability, made progress on the integration of our recent acquisitions and delivered on key pieces of our capital allocation strategy. At the same time, we are mindful of the relative size of the first quarter and some ongoing uncertainties in the overall market. Thus, some caution continues to be reflected in our updated full year outlook. But we will also remain opportunistic as we go forward, making investments and taking actions that support our long-term growth ambitions and drive value to our shareholders. \r\nNow I would like to turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) At this time, we will take a question from Joe Altobello from Raymond James.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nThis is [Martin] on for Joe. Just wondering if we can get an update on overall demand trends, particularly on hard coolers? And just any explanation that might be driving them, whether it's affordability, competition, saturation or sort of some combination of all of the above?\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nYes. Martin, thank you for the question. So I think, first of all, we were pleased to return to growth in both soft and hard coolers. In soft coolers, obviously it was related to having the recall products back in our lineup, but in hard coolers, there was an element of a sell-in compare in wholesale. But at the same time, during Q1, we were also comping against the EOL transition promo, that was an issue in Q4 that we called out. \r\nBut like we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we saw growth in C&E on both a sell-in and a sell-through basis. But I think the key point is that Q1 is our smallest quarter, and there's a seasonality aspect in coolers to consider. But as we look forward, as we enter the seasonally higher period, we think we're in a really good position to win in coolers. We've got our entire assortment back in the market of soft coolers and we've got new innovation coming in hard coolers. \r\nWe do believe there's some sensitivity to higher price point items in the market that still exist. But for the demand that is in the market, we believe we're in a really great position to go win it. \r\nFrom a competitive standpoint, I think like we've said all along, we've got -- we've had competitors in all categories for years. We believe we've got the best products in the market and we're in a good position to win.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nGreat. And just kind of on our last thought about sort of softness in high-end items, have the targeted price cuts on certain Roadie and Tundra products help this for demand? And should we anticipate any additional pricing actions as well as any future innovation, will that be at lower price points, just to combat affordability?\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nYes. I think -- so just to touch on the second question, the -- we introduced, as Matt called out, we talked about 2 new products, a lower price point -- our lowest price point wheeled cooler and then a new entry point hard cooler for the category. I wouldn't say that's being done in response to anything happening in the market. This is us just completing what we believe is a full portfolio of the products that meets a number of use cases out there. So I wouldn't characterize this as being done in response to anything that's happening in the market. \r\nAnd I think the same thing goes for the price reductions. I mean what we did in Q1 was -- and we talked about this last quarter, it was really in response to the new innovation that was coming and making sure that our pricing stack made sense is that the price to value as you go up the portfolio makes sense in the consumer's mind. \r\nSo in terms of what happened in Q1, it was a select number of SKUs. It wasn't the entire portfolio, but it was largely in line with what we expected. We saw the elasticity on a unit basis that we expected, and we were pleased with the results.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nGreat. Congratulations on a great quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Randy Konik from Jefferies.\n\nRandal J. Konik\n\nMatt, I wanted to ask a question around innovation. When I think about, let's say, the last couple of years, I've thought about incremental growth being derived a lot from, let's say, additional color ways to the assortment. But more recently, it appears to me, and I could be wrong, that there's been a sizable impact from form factor changes in innovation as it relates to, let's say, the french press, or the cocktail shaker, coffee ceramic products, et cetera, on the Drinkware side. \r\nCan you maybe kind of give us that -- your perspective there on that innovation around as it relates to form factor changes versus color? Because I think what would be interesting there is, if, in fact, a lot of the incremental growth is coming from form factor changes, it just provides a lot more kind of opportunity and changes for existing and new customers to buy into more and more YETI products? I just want to get your perspective there.\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nRandy, thanks for the question. I think it's a combination of things. You're correct. And as we have continued to scale, as we continue to draw on new audiences domestically and globally into the brand, we've seen opportunity to expand our product portfolio within our 2 big groups. \r\nDrinkware has expanded. We think in a really thoughtful kind of powerful way as you know from following our story. We focus on our productivity and the leverage we get on each SKU we launch. And the same with C&E, we've driven innovation within hard coolers, within soft coolers, expansion of our cargo business, the expansion of our bags, the addition of M&A to drive an accelerant there. And so we do think that it gives us the opportunity to address more consumer needs and more points in time or more points in their day. \r\nSo that form factor change, I think you're going to continue to see a rhythm of us doing that as we expand and diversify the product portfolio. And we think that's a really impactful way to grow the business. \r\nColor does play an important role in not just customer acquisition, but also repeat purchase. As people build out their YETI ownership, what we see is that people want more color. They want to add into their portfolio, and that's not just a Drinkware thing, that's actually across the range. \r\nWhat we really work to do is find a balance in those things. We don't want to chase smaller and smaller opportunity and more and more bespoke. We want to continue to put big consumer-relevant items out there in form factor, big consumer relevant items out there as it relates to color. And that's a formula that's worked for us. And as we continue to grow and scale the business, it's a formula we're seeing work not only in the U.S. but around the world.\n\nRandal J. Konik\n\nYes. Very helpful. And then last question and related to that, just give us your long-term vision then around how you think about the MYSTERY RANCH acquisition and product set, and then also your ambition around cookware. Just give us your thoughts there again on the long term, that would be very helpful.\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nThanks, Randy. 2 things, and we've said this before, we think those are 2 very large, highly fragmented categories, very global in nature, both bags and cookware. We think there is an opportunity to leverage YETI's commercial go-to-market the way we tell brand stories, the way we do our product marketing, the way we cultivate our consumer base. We think it's a really attractive opportunity in both of those to drive further ownership of YETI repeat purchase further use cases. \r\nSo I think what you're going to see in both those instances, and I talked about this on the call, we'll have our real first entry into cookware, the kind of top end of cast-iron later this year. In bags, as we look at taking the some of the ingredients and the capabilities and the talent that came along with the Mystery Ranch acquisition and we combine that with some of the materials and talent and designs that we had at YETI, is bringing that together and really building out our bags portfolios as we think about the opportunity in active and every day and in travel. \r\nAnd so with the team that we put in place around both of those things, we're really excited about what that can mean underneath the YETI brand umbrella. And we talk all the time, our focus is on what the TAM is for the YETI brand. And we think both of those categories fit really well underneath that.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd now we have a question from Anna Glaessgen from B. Riley.\n\nAnna Glaessgen\n\nI think last year, you noted that the introductions of tumbler has brought a lot of new customers into the fold. Can you talk about how these new customers are engaging with the brand? Are you seeing repeat purchase behavior? Any color on that would be great.\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nAnna, this is Matt. A couple of things I would say, and a little bit to the prior question from Randy. As we keep expanding the product portfolio in what I would call useful ways to the consumer and thoughtful ways for them to engage, we've also continued to diversify our consumer base. \r\nAnd as we said in our prepared remarks, the value of our customers continues to go up. The returning and newly acquired customers from a value perspective, we like that dynamic where we can give them more product that's useful to them. \r\nI think when you look at the expansion, what we're seeing is people diving deeper into our product portfolio, people coming back and repeat purchasing their favorite product. And that's part of our marketing efforts, it's part of our product marketing efforts. It's also part of how we're advancing some of our analytics and how we put the right offer, the right opportunity at the right time in front of the consumer. \r\nBut we really like the customers that we've acquired over the last 3 to 4 years to complement the customers that we've had kind of long-standing with YETI. And we think that's the opportunity to keep bringing innovation in form factor, keep bringing excitement in color and then keep that emotional engagement with YETI.\n\nAnna Glaessgen\n\nGreat. And could you expand a bit? You noted that you're reinvesting in the brand and not flowing through kind of the full gross margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit more about what's the key priorities are with that investment?\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nYes. So I'd say it's a couple of areas. #1, it's really around what we're doing to grow YETI outside the United States. So -- and you're seeing the results of that, including this quarter, where we grew international over 30%, and it's now 19% of our business. \r\nSo I think within International, it's building out the teams we need, it's growing the brand, building brand awareness, building the technology tools that we need, the supply chain infrastructure we need, et cetera, #1. \r\n#2, as we look to kind of build out our inorganic opportunities and be able to support inorganic opportunities, there's obviously a need to build out a team internally to do that, and we talked about that last year in terms of the first steps that we were making there. \r\nAnd then I think third, even domestically, as we look to expand the portfolio into new areas, that are focused on new communities, there's an element of really driving brand awareness in those new areas and in those new product categories. So those are just some of the areas that you'll see us continue to invest in and hopefully see the results as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Peter Benedict from Baird.\n\nPeter Sloan Benedict\n\nFirst, kind of a follow-up on one of the earlier questions. Just curious around Mystery Ranch. I mean, Matt, you mentioned it as being an accelerant to your bags innovation. I'm just curious around the timing there. Is 2025 too soon to think that you could see an acceleration in your bags innovation, leveraging some of what you've gotten with Mystery Ranch? Or is it going to take longer than that? Or is 2025 a good time to eye for some initial innovation? That's my first question.\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nPeter, thanks for that. I would say, almost frankly before we even closed with Mystery Ranch, we started to work with the teams on how we bring sort of the best ingredients together of both businesses. And so they're active and well down that path. \r\nI think as we go into 2025, we'd look to bring out some additional products that will have the results of the work of those 2 teams coming together, and that's what they're racing towards. This is not something where I think we're years out from seeing the benefit. And it's the result of partnering with a great group of people, who have the talent, combined with the talent we have at YETI, that we can move really quickly on this. So we're excited to get going and kind of put our first products out together.\n\nPeter Sloan Benedict\n\nGreat. And then I want to pivot over to the international business. Nice to see kind of the management or the addition for the Asia region. Just remind us kind of how you're viewing the org structure now internationally, how you plan to build that out and support the growth? \r\nAnd then is there any margin difference we should be thinking about with the international business relative to the U.S. as that business continues to improve its penetration? Is there any DTC to wholesale mix to think about or anything else from that angle?\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nThanks. I'll take the front end of that from a structural perspective, and then Mike can step in on the margin. As we think about the opportunity internationally, one of the things we've shifted our structure, our go-to-market structure to have commercial organizations focused on each of the major regions. So the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and then Asia Pacific. \r\nAnd the reason being all 3 are different stages of their maturation and their development and their growth and their needs. And so to have a team that is focused on taking advantage of those opportunities, taking advantage of the opportunity we have in the Americas and taking advantage of the opportunity -- the burgeoning opportunity we have in Europe and in the Middle East. \r\nAnd then the opportunity we have building off the strength of an incredible business in Australia, as we called out on the call, but in North Asia and in Greater Asia. And so I think that's where we're excited to get a leader in Naoji over that region to start really kind of stoking what we think is opportunity underneath the surface.\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nPeter, it's Mike. And so a couple of things on your question. First, at a sales mix level, it really kind of -- it differs by region, but I would say that international, we haven't given specifics, but what we have said is that we don't have our full D2C model outside the U.S. and in several cases, we've said that corporate sales is underpenetrated. \r\nWe haven't had customization at scale. And so that would imply that maybe wholesales are a slightly bigger mix, a piece of the mix internationally just because of not having the full D2C model. But we certainly believe that we're in a position to drive that going forward, and you'll see the D2C mix internationally continue to increase. \r\nFrom a margin perspective, what we said once you normalize by -- for channel that the gross margins are relatively the same as in the U.S. There's some differences by region. But for the most part, internationally, they're pretty -- versus the U.S., they're pretty similar. \r\nWhere you see the difference is on the operating margin line. So some of the more -- the regions where we've been in market for longer, Canada and Australia, we see really strong operating margins that are accretive to YETI and newer regions that are still emerging like Europe, we're still investing. And so you -- we still got some room to sort of drive operating margins up in those countries. \r\nBut as Europe continues to grow, we'll see that benefit. That just may be offset by new regions that we enter like Asia, where we're going to be going through a similar dynamic that we've been going through in Europe where the first few years are really about investing and building out the region.\n\nPeter Sloan Benedict\n\nGot it. So as we scale internationally, there's nothing structural, but that keeps the margins below it other than just investments in growing new markets. So -- perfect.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have a question from John Kernan from TD Cowen.\n\nJohn David Kernan\n\nJust a couple of questions here. The Drinkware business accelerated the [last 2] quarters over 12% growth close to 13% this quarter. Maybe talk to some of the drivers of that. There's been some new entrants into the marketplace. You've obviously had some category expansion. Just curious, how should we think about Drinkware versus Coolers & Equipment for the end of the year?\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nYes. Thanks, John. I'll take the kind of the dynamic piece and then Mike can help out and take the back end of that. I would say, as Mike said in an earlier comment, we've always lived in a competitive market for our products. I think what YETI has done consistently is drive innovation, tell consumers why it's relevant, put relevant products out in front of the consumer and be thoughtful about not only our form factor innovation, but also color. I think the success that we're seeing is both new and returning YETI customers responding to the product offering. \r\nAnd I think when you think about our product portfolio and the reason we call out the 50-plus SKUs is that in Drinkware, that diversification, giving consumers more reasons to engage with YETI products throughout the day, I think is a key part of our strategy, and I think it's a key part of the success that we've had.\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nYes. And the only thing that I'd add, John is, Matt talked about innovation, just the growth opportunity outside the United States that we have. And then as we look forward and what we expect for the year, we said we expect C&E to outpace Drinkware growth, but we do expect to have -- to grow Drinkware this year kind of a similar rate that we saw last year. And we think there's -- we're off to a good start to deliver that based on Q1.\n\nJohn David Kernan\n\nGot it. Maybe then just a follow-up on 2 partners, DICK's and Amazon, obviously, Amazon being on the DTC side and DICK's on the wholesale side. I think the 2 channels account for almost a quarter of the company sales at this point, when you gross up the wholesale dollars it takes. \r\nTalk about, I guess, the wholesale channel, sales space there, particularly at DICK's and then also Amazon, growth there continues to outpace the company average. I'm just curious what you're learning on Amazon and how much more you can do with them?\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nSo let me -- I'll take the DICK's question maybe kind of expand out to wholesale broadly. And then Mike will talk about the DTC dynamics in the overall for YETI. \r\nAs you think about our wholesale, and we've said this before, we feel great about the wholesale footprint we have, we feel great about the reach we have with consumers and how we're intersecting. As you know, we've been very thoughtful at how many doors and how rapidly we expand because we continue to invest in our in the productivity at the stores in which we operate, and we invest in the productivity and the performance for our partners, and that's been a hallmark of YETI. \r\nWe've commented before that our shelf space is -- remained the same. Our mix on the shelf as we launch new products and as we innovate, our wholesale partners continue to find ways to merchandise us, find the space for our products. So the biggest change we've seen in recent is how much of the total space within stores is committed to our categories. \r\nAnd I think that's a dynamic of the consumer interest, particularly around Drinkware and particularly around hydration, which we think the attention to the category, as you've seen in the results from YETI, only continue to benefit the strong product offering that we have there. \r\nSo I'd say, as we look across our wholesale landscape in the U.S., we feel very good about the footprint we have. We feel very good about the support we have from our wholesale partners, we feel great about the receptivity to our innovation and the things that we have coming. And they continue to be a really important piece of YETI's performance.\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nOn Amazon, John. I mean, obviously, with our disclosures in the 10-K, it would imply we had a really strong Amazon year last year from a growth perspective. We called it out as we went through the year. It was a driver, not only our growth but also from an SG&A standpoint. \r\nWhat we said this quarter is that we saw good growth across all of our D2C subchannels, Amazon included. And that's on top of having a really strong year last year. So we didn't give specific color on Amazon or haven't given specific color on Amazon from a guidance or outlook perspective, other than to say we think it's a really important channel for us. It can continue to be a really important channel for us. But it's going to be, I think, balanced with our other D2C subchannels this year.\n\nOperator\n\nNow let's take a question from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler.\n\nPeter Jacob Keith\n\nNice results here. Sticking on internationally. I've gotten a couple of questions. But with the acceleration you've seen in the last 2 quarters, I was hoping you could just maybe highlight where some of that acceleration is coming from? \r\nAnd then Mike also with the acceleration, why would the full year guide still be 20% to 25% for International? And finally, on International. I think you've talked about a 30% sales penetration target long term. Is there any thought that, that might be higher as we go forward?\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nThanks, Peter. I'll take a bit of that and then Michael weigh in a bit, too. \r\nWhen we look at kind of where that acceleration is coming from, we called out on the call, Australia continues to perform extremely well. We have an incredible team down there. They have a great wholesale footprint that is getting the brand out in front of consumers throughout Australia. We have a strong e-commerce business. We identified and called out the opportunity in the growing customization or personalization capabilities. They're building a really nice corporate sales business. \r\nAnd then we're a little earlier in New Zealand, but New Zealand is a great market for us. It's a market that's a perfect fit for YETI. So I think that's a market where we've got a lot of things in place to be able to build on top of the momentum and the success that, that business is at going back to 2017. So I think that business is in the kind of build strength-on-strength mode. \r\nIn Europe, we called out the U.K. and Germany, been broadly in Europe, we're seeing the brand awareness grow. We're seeing product placement. Our partnerships, our marketing, our ambassadors, our event activations, so running the classic YETI playbook is really starting to pay dividends. \r\nAnd we launched that business right before -- in late-2019, right before the pandemic. So it had a little bit of a slower start with the wholesale disruption during that period. I think now we're in a mode where wholesale partners are starting to grow. We're getting the right kind of and thoughtful additional doors. We're driving a strong e-commerce business. We've got a corporate sales business that's really starting to turf up some really interesting opportunities that are really brand -- on brand, brand right and exciting ways to get that kind of first-hand shake of product into the consumer's hands. So we feel really good about those growth platforms. \r\nIn Canada, as our longest-standing international market, continues to diversify their channels to market, continues to grow the corporate sales, continues to drive the customization, has great wholesale partnerships. So overall, I think we're at the mode where that accelerant is something we're putting some energy into to the previous question and putting kind of smart dollars behind it. \r\nI think as far as the target of where it can go, when we first -- when we were kind of talking about 0 international sales, we put illustrative examples of brands that were U.S.-based that have grown internationally, and that's where the 30% came. It was never necessarily a target. But as you look at the opportunity that we're proving is out there and then the opportunity we haven't yet tapped, we haven't put a cap on what we think international can be as far as a contribution to YETI.\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nPeter, this is Mike. The only thing I'd add is in terms of why we didn't adjust the guidance, and I think it comes down to just -- it's 1 quarter, it's our smallest quarter. Still have a lot of the year left to go. If you take the full year guide and kind of back out the Q1 results, you're still in that range that we've talked about of 20% to 25% growth for the year. \r\nBut obviously, as we think there's a lot of momentum here, we think there's opportunity here for us, not only this year but long term. But for now, we're going to sort of hold our guidance for the year. We're just focused on delivering the 7% to 9% for the company overall, and we feel like International is going to be a big piece of that.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd now we have a question from Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.\n\nBrooke Siler Roach\n\nWhere do you think a sustainable long-term margin path might look like for the brand as you increasingly diversify your business into new categories and geographies relative to the prior rates that you achieved in 2021?\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nBrooke, I think the front end of your question, at least on our line, cut out, so I apologize, but could you repeat the question?\n\nBrooke Siler Roach\n\nYes. Sure. Can you hear me now?\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nYes.\n\nBrooke Siler Roach\n\nGreat. I was just hoping you could help us understand where you think the sustainable long-term operating profit margin path might look like for the brand as you diversify your business into new categories and geographies relative to the 2021 prior peak?\n\nMichael James McMullen\n\nBrooke, it's Mike. Thank you for the question. So as we've talked about, we believe that as we -- that we've recaptured a lot of the inbound freight cost peak that we saw in the 2021 and 2022 time frame. We are at a point that now we've captured that, we believe we can start to kind of build back operating margin over time. \r\nI think you're going to see that in sort of 2 ways. Obviously, 1 would be continue to drive up gross margins through sales mix, supply chain efficiencies, product cost efficiencies. And 2, we believe that over time, we will begin to -- we will start to get leverage on our SG&A. There's going to be quarters here there where that may not -- you may not see that just quarter-to-quarter variability. But over the long term, that is absolutely our goal and is absolutely what we believe we can deliver. \r\nWe talked about the international piece a bit earlier. 2 of our regions are, from an operating margin standpoint are absolutely accretive to the company. They're at a point to where -- they've got a good piece of the infrastructure they need. Europe is where we're doing a lot of our investing now just because of the opportunity that we see. \r\nSo -- but over time, as we scale that business, we'll start to get benefit as they drive up their operating margin. That just may be offset as we launch new regions. And obviously, we took a big step recently with a new member of our team is going to help lead our entrance into that region. \r\nFrom a new product standpoint, I think we'll have to see kind of where we go. But as we've done over the last 6, 8 years, as we broadened our product portfolio beyond just Coolers and Drinkware, those new products, as we've launched them, are even expanded within those core categories. They've all been at margins that are relatively in line with what we've done in the past. \r\nSo we have -- we don't have a history of as we expand the product portfolio, the margins go down. So we believe we can continue to expand our operating margins from here, both through gross margin upside as well as leverage on our SG&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd this will conclude our question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the conference back over to Matt Reintjes for any closing remarks.\n\nMatthew J. Reintjes\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks all for joining the call this morning. We look forward to speaking with you during our Q2 call.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd this concludes our conference. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Will Its Colossal Gains Continue or Reverse?",
        "content": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has grown remarkably, soaring approximately 490% in under two years. However, Meta recently saw its most significant market cap decline since 2022, shedding around $200 billion following its Q1 results. The stock received downward revisions in target prices across Wall Street. The crucial question now is whether to buy or sell. Personally, I view this as an opportunity to invest in the stock based on its AI-based growth trajectory. I believe it can keep rising.\n\nWeak Revenue Outlook, Higher AI Spend Disappoint Despite Q1 EPS Beat\n\nMeta’s Q1 adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $4.32 per share. Also, earnings more than doubled year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.20 per share in the prior-year period. Revenues jumped 27% year-over-year to $36.5 billion, meeting consensus estimates by $36.2 billion.\n\nThe revenue jump was fueled by a 27% rise in Advertising revenue (accounts for 98% of total revenues) to $35.64 billion. However, the Reality Labs division (the division that invests in the Metaverse) continued to report losses, amounting to $3.85 billion for the quarter.\n\nDespite the EPS beat, the stock experienced its largest single-day decline (15%) in over two years. This decline can be attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance and higher-than-expected capital expenditures (CAPEX) forecasts.\n\nThe Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent expects Q2 total revenue to range between $36.5-39 billion, while the consensus was pegged at $38.3 million. CAPEX is expected to increase to $35-40 billion versus the prior guided range of $30-37 billion. Further, expenses are expected to increase and are forecasted to continue to increase through next year. For FY2024, total expenses are predicted to range around $96-99 billion versus the prior guided range of $94-99 billion.\n\nMeta Plans to Invest Heavily in Creating Massive AI Infrastructure\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg elaborated on Meta’s heightened investment plans in AI infrastructure. The company aims to inject billions into the AI space and develop its proprietary AI chips, thereby reducing dependence on chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIn terms of newer products, the company also announced that MetaAI, featuring Llama 3 (competing with Microsoft’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini), is poised to become the most efficient AI assistant. This innovation could represent a substantial business opportunity in the coming years, further contributing to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta’s AI investment plans align somewhat with its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the AI domain. While Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported CAPEX of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent $14 billion. Both Google and MSFT plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nHowever, Google and Meta’s shares soared after their recent earnings. On the contrary, Meta’s shares plunged as their capital investments are still not visible in their revenue and earnings growth. For instance, Google and Microsoft’s capital investments in AI are yielding impressive growth in their cloud businesses. However, Meta’s Reality Labs business segment still remains unprofitable, with reported losses exceeding $45 billion since the end of FY2020.\n\nIn essence, while AI spending is translating into direct gains for Google and Microsoft, it’s taking Meta longer to show such returns, turning it into a capital-intensive, cash-sucking endeavor. Therefore, the following question arises: should investors wait and observe or buy the stock at current levels following the recent decline?\n\nIn the long run, Meta’s move to produce its own chips will likely benefit the company significantly by reducing costs associated with expensive GPUs procured from NVDA currently. Additionally, owning its AI infrastructure promises faster and more efficient processing of vast amounts of data for the social media giant.\n\nMeta Stock Is Attractively Valued and Backed by Stable Free Cash Flows\n\nIn terms of its valuation, Meta is attractively valued. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 23.5x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. For the sake of comparison, Microsoft is trading at a P/E of 35x, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at over 50x.\n\nDespite elevated capital expenditures, Meta’s free cash flows remain healthy at $49.5 billion for the past 12 months, or 4.1% of the current market capitalization. It is worth noting that the company started a dividend for the first time in the preceding quarter and continued to buy back shares, implying that management is confident in the company’s fundamentals.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about the stock. Overall, META commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. Meta Platforms stock’s average price target of $530.93 implies 11.73% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Current Stock Price Weakness as a Buying Opportunity\n\nSocial media giant Meta has built a vast user base over time, establishing itself as the clear industry leader. Its steady position among the world’s “Magnificent 7” mega-cap stocks is well-deserved, supported by the continued growth in advertising revenue per user. Notably, Meta’s revenues and margins have been growing impressively, and the integration of AI infrastructure across its portfolio is poised to drive revenues even higher in the coming years.\n\nFor those who missed out on Meta’s remarkable stock rally (second only to NVDA) over the last two years, the current dip presents a buying opportunity, in my view. I personally plan to buy the stock and hold it for the long term.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&amp;T-Style Breakup Next?",
        "content": "Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week.\n\nNow, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space.\n\nMehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year.\n\nThe case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space.\n\nSpecifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space.\n\nLast week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox.\n\nGoogle is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy.\n\nThe final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023.\n\nRead also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake?\n\nThe case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department. The central argument of the lawsuit is that Google’s control of today’s internet is extensive enough to be considered a monopoly, and that it violated antitrust laws by paying competitor firms, cell phone manufacturers, and wireless internet providers to maintain its position as the default search engine.\n\nThe company then benefitted from the extra traffic via its ad business.\n\nFor its part, Google has argued that its market dominance is merely a result of the superior quality of its products in a fair competition game. While the company has admitted to paying partners and competitors to give its search engine a prime position, it has argued (both in an open letter from September 2023 and in the trial) that web browser developers choose to showcase Google by their own will.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has also argued that competitors like Yahoo or Bing also pay browser developers to receive a preferential position in their software and that it's very easy for users to change the default search engine on any device.\n\nThe importance of the trial is hard to overstate. This case marks the first time the Federal Government has brought a big technology company to court on antitrust charges in over two decades, since a U.S. judge ruled that Microsoft had violated the nation’s antitrust laws in 2000, in a lawsuit initiated by the Justice Department and 19 states in 1998.\n\nThe consequences of the decision could also ripple across several other antitrust lawsuits currently shaking up Big Tech companies, including an ongoing antitrust probe by the Federal Trade Commission into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as well as a probe by the same agency into Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), parent company of Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram.\n\nGoogle is also under fire in Europe, where the EU’s Court of Justice is fining it $2.6 billion over antitrust penalties.\n\nWhat's At Stake For Google?\n\nIn a press release, the Justice Department has compared this lawsuit with other landmark antitrust actions including Microsoft in 1998 and AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 1974 trial which eventually broke the Bell system into several companies nationwide in 1982.\n\nBy the end of last week's arguments, Mehta said he has not arrived at a decision yet. According to CNN, the judge proposed that in order to be able to compete with Google's dominant position, a hypothetical competitor would need to invest billions, not just in developing the complex search tool itself, but also in competing with Google on its billion-dollar exclusivity contracts with web browser developers and device manufacturers.\n\n\"I can't conceive of a world in which some other competitor, particularly a new competitor, could do that. Microsoft couldn't do it,\" Mehta said.\n\nIf Mehta rules in favor of the Justice Department, the trial would move to a second stage, wherein the court would determine which penalties Google should face. In these separate proceedings, plaintiffs and the company would present different ways in which Google should respond in order to relinquish some of its alleged monopolistic power.\n\nPossible avenues would be to break up the company into several units, including a separate one for the Android operating system, which is currently owned by Google, according to Bloomberg. Another possible penalty would be forcing Google to disclose its search data to competitors in order to level the playing field, or forcing the company to give up its exclusivity agreements with other companies.\n\nBill Baer, a former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division told the New York Times that it's unlikely that DOJ. will seek some sort of breakup for the company.\n\n\"It's more likely there will be some sort of restrictions on Google's behavior going forward,\" he said.\n\nNow read: Has Chrome Been Tracking You During ‘Incognito’ Mode?

        "title": "Reddit is maturing as a company, CEO says",
        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) is entering its adult years, and that may turn out well for investors.\n\n\"A lot of things are really starting to click,\" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above).\n\nThe company this week reported its first results since going public in late March — and there was much to prove the bears wrong.\n\nDaily active users increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year.\n\nTotal revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after ringing a bell on the floor in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nHuffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\n\"Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note.\n\nFor Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024.\n\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\n\nThe stock began trading at $47 per share and quickly shot past $53.\n\nShares finished their first day of trading on March 21 at $50.44.\n\nThe stock currently trades at around $50 and received a double-digit percentage boost after earnings this week. Reddit's market cap is now roughly $8.1 billion.\n\nThe company was the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\n\nDespite being in business for almost 20 years, Reddit had never turned a profit before the first quarter. Last year the company saw sales rise 21% year over year to $804 million. The net loss clocked in at $90.8 million.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is also full steam ahead on AI, just like Reddit. In the latest episode of the Opening Bid podcast, Amazon's AWS CEO Adam Selipsky took investors inside the tech giant's AI plans.

        "title": "Q1 2024 Laird Superfood Inc Earnings Call",
        "content": "Presentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining the Laird Superfood First Quarter 2024 financial results. My name is Kate, and I will be the moderator for today's call. At this time. All lines are in a listen-only mode and will be until the question and answer portion of the call. I would now like to turn the call over to Trevor Rizza You may proceed.\r\n Trevor.\n\nThank you and good afternoon. Welcome to Ruby Foods First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On today's call are Jason beak mode. Superfoods President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ernie Handel, our Chief Financial Officer. By now everyone should have access to the company's first quarter earnings release filed today after market close is available on the Investor Relations section of Laird Superfood website at w. w. w. dot Laird Superfood.com.\r\n Before we begin, please note that during the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the context of federal securities laws. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. Please refer to today's press release and other filings with the SEC for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\r\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\n\nThanks, Trevor. Good afternoon and another big thank you to everyone who has joined us again today. I am excited to share that the Laird Superfood turnaround story has officially become a growth story. Once again, during the first quarter, we grew the net sales of our business by an impressive 22% versus the same period one year ago. Our sales growth during this period was led by our e-commerce segment, which grew 33% year over year, despite another sizable decrease in marketing spend across those periods. Amazon led the way this quarter with an astounding 48% growth rate, driven by our continued improvement in product availability, marketing effectiveness and inventory management. We have continued to hone our execution, driving out unauthorized resellers of our products and winning the buy box to ensure that our brand sales on the Amazon platform are being filled by our Laird Superfood team perhaps the biggest surprise to the PC industry observers will be our impressive 25% growth in our own DTC business, where we continue to demonstrate our ability to convert viewers into buyers buyers into repeat buyers and repeat buyers into subscribers. Approximately half of our DTC business is now made up of subscription sales. Over the past months. Our team is focused on creating a website and e-mail platform where we can share health and wellness, nutrition and lifestyle tips and stories with our consumer base, thereby giving them a reason to continually interact with our brand and website and by continuing to leverage Laird Hamilton and his wife, Gabby Reece, we have been able to create highly relevant, authentic and original content that provides a competitive advantage for our brand. Further, our customer service and net promoter scores remain best-in-class and our consumers clearly recognize and appreciate the care with which we handle their orders from their website interaction to arrival at their door.\r\n On the wholesale side of our business, we grew net sales by 10% year over year during Q1, which is even more impressive since it was done without the benefit of a price increase during the last 12 months. Even more encouraging is that retail scanner sales for our Laird Superfood brand were up significantly more than our net sales during this quarter, reported as plus 30% across U.S. food for the 12 week period ending March 24th, given the growth rate discrepancy between retailer scanner data and our LSS internal sales, there was clearly a deloading of inventory across our two large distribution partners. And so we expect to see continued strength in this channel of business as we move forward.\r\n Within wholesale, our business grew during Q1 across all our measured categories in terms of both units and dollars, led by our coffee and instant latte products, which now combined to be our largest category at retail. Our club business also remains extremely healthy, and we continue to see growth in our sales velocities behind our improved product following last year's QUALITY events.\r\n On the operations side, our team continues to demonstrate strong results driven by supply chain execution across procurement, production and distribution, as well as favorability in our trade spend our gross margin was 40% during Q1, which was several points ahead of our own internal projections. Despite a planned write-down in the value of our coconut milk powder that planned write-down was actually a positive result for us as it was driven by the recognition that we are now able to procure our largest commodity ingredient at a significantly better rate than we had previously been able to with our supply chain team executing at a high level, we have been able to effectively offset various cost increases. And at this point, expect to be able to do so throughout 2024.\r\n As we shared previously, the first quarter is a strategic investment quarter for us as the marketing activities that we fund early in the year are able to be leveraged during subsequent quarters. That said, we were able to once again reduce our year-over-year marketing expense during Q1 behind better execution and more efficient activations our marketing expense for the quarter was just over 20% of net sales, which obviously represents a dramatic decrease from prior years as we move forward. Our midterm goal is to continue to press this down into the low 10s and eventually into the high single digits. But with the opportunities in front of us and a return to solid brand growth in the first quarter. We are quite pleased with where this currently stands. In fact, we are very pleased with the first quarter results where we over executed our internal plan and are now on pace to exceed our stated goals for 2024. With this in mind, I think it's time to change the storyline on Laird Superfood from a turnaround project to a growth story, one in which we are growing our consumer base across our various sales channels and preparing ourselves for the next chapter of expansion.\r\n With that, I will now turn it over to Anya to discuss our first quarter 2024 results in more detail.\n\nStory continues\n\nThank you, Jason, and welcome, everyone. Our team's work over the last 18 months has transformed our financial foundation and positioned our business for growth. I am pleased to share with you that our first quarter results have exceeded our operating plan on every key metric. Net sales grew 22% to $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $9.2 million in the prior year period. And we're up by 700,000 sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2023. As Jason indicated, both the e-commerce and wholesale channels contributed to Q1 growth. E-commerce sales increased by 33% year over year and accounted for 59% of our total net sales with our Amazon and B2C platforms delivering impressive growth of 48% and 25%, respectively. Amazon sales growth was fueled by tremendous execution on a platform where our team was able to improve our inventory positions, increase our buy box win percentage and drive efficient media spend. Q1 growth in our DTC platform was driven by steady increase in subscribers and repeat orders, higher order value and lower discount rates due to strategic shifts in promotional spend wholesale net sales increased by 10% year over year and contributed 41% of total net sales, reflecting continued growth in club velocity improvements and distribution expansion in grocery as well as more efficient promotional expense.\r\n Gross margin was 40% in the first quarter, which is a 17 point improvement on a year-over-year basis and was driven by the continued benefit of transitioning to third party co-manufacturing and distribution model and lab and expenses related to the product quality event in the first quarter of last year. This is the second quarter in a row of gross margin of at least 40%, which supports our expectation for sustainably achieving gross margins in or above the upper 30s in the coming quarters.\r\n Operating expense decreased 1.1 million in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This reduction was primarily driven by lower people costs, lower marketing and a broad strategic reduction in spend. Net loss for the first quarter was 1.0 million, which is 75% better versus the prior year period, driven by higher net sales and expanded gross margin as well as continued discipline around G&A spending versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Our Q1 net loss was 1.2 million higher due to stepped-up planned marketing investments and timing of G&A spend.\r\n Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $7.3 million of cash and no debt as we continue to conservatively manage our balance sheet. Our cash burn in Q1 was 400,000, which is obviously significantly better than our historical burn rate, but higher than the last quarter due to stepped-up marketing investments and payout of our company bonus, which had been fully expensed during 2023. Our cash consumption rate is steadily improving due to our continued discipline in managing operating expenses and working capital, including significant reductions in inventory in the first quarter, inventory was reduced by $700,000 or 11% compared to the year end of 2023 while also supporting 22% revenue growth. Also, we just entered into a credit facility agreement that allows us to access up to 2 million in cash as backed by the sale of our accounts receivables. This will create additional liquidity source should we choose to utilize it. We continue to project that we have enough cash to fund our operations into at least 2026 as we continue to grow our business and make operating improvements that drive us towards breakeven and profitability. Overall, these results strengthen our confidence that the strategic initiatives our team has been implementing during the last 18 months are achieving our intended results. At this point, we are increasing the upper end of our guidance for full year 2024. We now expect net sales of 38 to 42 million, which represents 11 to 22 points of growth versus prior year. And we are now projecting gross margin of 30% to 41%, representing a seven to 11 point improvement versus 2023.\r\n And now I will turn the discussion back over to Jason for any closing remarks.\n\nThank you, Andrea, and thank you to everyone who has been listening to and supporting us during the past two years. I hope you'll agree that we've made good on the expectations that we outlined during those quarters. And while it's been extremely satisfying for our LSF. team to achieve these results so far, we are even more excited and motivated for what is yet to come.\r\n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer portion of the call. If you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing star followed by a one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove your question, you may do so by pressing star followed by a two. As a reminder, if you're using a speakerphone, please remember to pick up your handset before asking your question again to ask a question. It is star followed by a one on your telephone keypad. First question comes from the line of Bobby Burleson with Canaccord Genuity.\r\n Bobby Your line is now open.\r\n Great.\n\nThanks for taking my questions. And congratulations. It sounds like things are definitely shifting to this growth phase. And I guess my my first question is just trying to understand at this Xantic coming to them dynamic in your food is medicine and food and health and whether or not there's a bigger role for Laird to play within that growth story a body, Jason, thanks for presenting all of this today.\r\n Yes, you know, the Olympics, it kind of has that the craze that's taken the nation, I would say it's largely not impactful to us. And that's because the consumers that are seeking us out. They truly are food as medicine, you know, and it's always going to be a smaller than mainstream niche. We still think a very sizable and growing niche, but certainly it's not the mainstream eat, whatever you want to take a pill afterwards to cure what you just did to yourself. We are very much focused on the consumer or I would say, very relevant to the consumer that is going the opposite direction. That says what I put into my body is ultimately going to be what, Tom, what determines my future F'08 and as opposed to trying to solve the problems they create. So we watch what's going on we're interested in it, but frankly, very detached from it with regards to our own food and portfolio because the consumers that are interested in Laird Superfood and our direct competitors are really coming at it from a different direction.\r\n Yes, fair enough. I guess I probably asked the question in too narrow of a sense. I think what I was getting at was is there a greater awareness on the part of consumers as a result of a lot of a lot of the things we're starting to see within CPG where there's maybe a food as medicine dynamic where people are paying attention to ingredients. And you guys have kind of a vanguard there where you're maybe not fixing mistakes, people are making, but you can promote health outcomes to a greater degree to a more receptive audience because of these Visa, there are trends driving greater awareness in that connection.\r\n Yes, Bobby, I am. I appreciate that with I love this question and I can frankly talk for hours on it, but not as eloquently as either Laird or Gabby, who really I've been at the forefront of this for a long time. And it's really interesting and I'll give you I'll give you the analog and then I'll use that to expand a little bit when I came, I came in from the food industry had income from big food, but I came from from WhiteWave, we've been at the forefront of bigger companies leading the charge to change boot in the way people eat for the better. But I would say I came in I've been at a couple of other brands after that and the human not really understanding, if I'm honest not really interesting Laird Superfood and some of the guardrails that have been placed on us. And so when I got here is our man, we could really make this food taste a lot better by using natural flavors as an example, why are we using natural flavors? And we started to go down the bad about Apple, and it takes a little bit better. And the reality is our food tastes like food is supposed to taste and natural flavors are not actually natural. Yes, that's one of the dirty secrets among many in the food space, especially amongst big food poisoning that frankly, that they have put into into bodies over decades now. And you're really hitting hitting again hitting a nerve with me here, the reality is, and I'll just give you this example, natural flavors, the other direct, they are derived from a natural product, but that chemically extracted in almost all cases, maybe all that chemical residue is passed on to the food that they go into. You might you might naturally extract a bit of tomato flavor, but you quote unquote in, call it a natural flavor, but it's got a chemical residue that comes because it was a chemical that derived was able to extract that flavor from from the tomato and at Laird, Hamilton will be several times as we have those discussions early on. If you take these products that you're talking about every day in a little bit of a small amount, a small amount of chemical, but used many times during the day over many days of your week over many weeks or months of your year to your life, suddenly in a decade down the road you have health problems and you can explain why? And there's there is an increasing recognition and understanding and awareness in that specific issue around natural flavors that's starting to grow, but more certainly more broadly across the other ingredients that you look at on the backpacks. And you don't understand and we're really marketing that.\r\n Now if you look at what we're doing with our greens relative to competitors. We talk about the fact that we are we're not a supplement or a food when you turn over the pack, you recognize in our grains all of the ingredients that are there and starts with fruits and vegetables, as you would expect. And you know, and you look at competitors, and that's not always the case. So we're using that added marketing, you have to be careful. People don't always like we preach to now with regards to, in fact, actually don't with regards to their diet and the products. They're consuming apps. We're doing that in a nuanced fashion, but we're finding more and more people receptive to it more and more people are searching and researching their foods and you see a number of podcasters such as Joe Rogan and neuroscientist and dietitians and others that are really getting vocal about these issues. And I think we're just at the beginning of a revolution in this space.\r\n Bobby, and your question's a great one. There is certainly more recognition of the skills that people are receiving from the food that they've been eating into the secret, you go to the researchers whole lot of secrecy in the food industry of what you're putting into your body that people are starting to become aware of.\r\n That's fantastic. I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on wholesale. Obviously, you guys have a lot of momentum in e-commerce and Amazon's picked up in a big way at what point do we see kind of the growth baton maybe get handed to conventional in the conventional grocery channel? I know you're doing some work there on expanding distribution and maybe growing your shelf space there, but curious like when you see a potential inflection in that particular channel.\r\n Yes, it's a great, great follow-on question. You know, the the way that we're looking at this where we've been looking at this strategically is conventional as kind of our last destination because we really know it's expensive to play your turn it become quickly. There's a lot of competition. And there obviously are margin challenges for smaller companies. So we've tiptoe into that space over the last couple of years.\r\n Bobby, we've you know, the natural channel has been very good to us. Our consumers identify has quickly and shop that space with the kind of attributes that we have as a product in mind. And so you're exactly right, your what you're seeing is a tremendous growth on Amazon DTC. has put up a couple of really nice quarters and really turned strategically turned that corner with the initiatives that we've implemented there the natural channel, so doing incredibly well for us and expanding rapidly. And we do recognize that the big piece of the pie is sitting out there in the conventional space. But I'd say we're still a year away from really being ready ready to go.\r\n And I would add, I mean, if not even full throttle at least had an increased throttle in that space because we do want to let consumers catch up to us a little bit on that exact trend you asked about in your last question, we want to allow more of those mainstream consumers to begin to identify the food as medicine type of mentality that you ask about in them and come to us there. So I would say we're still a year out from really starting to make major headway in that particular channel.\r\n Great. Thank you.\r\n Thanks, Bobby.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of George Kelly with ROTH Capital Partners. George, your line is now open.\n\nEveryone. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on another really nice quarter. So maybe if we could start, I'm still a little confused on Amazon. I was curious if you could just maybe expand a bit on what's been driving growth there and has inventory fill been a component of of that really rapid growth that you just reported in 1Q?\r\n Yes. George, thanks for your questions. Good to hear from you. Yes, we're really excited about Amazon. We expected to have strong growth in Amazon. Honestly, we replanted at about half of this growth rate and we knew that there was an opportunity in the channel for the first half of the year relative to the quality event that we had last year, but we had to pull inventory and you'll know we talked about that ad nauseam last year. So and I won't go into so much detail, but we ended up having to pull our inventory out as a slow slow pull on the creamer products, only creamer products. So we knew there was an opportunity as we lap that this year. But we are well in excess of our expectations on that platform in this in this quarter, we what we saw is really strong growth across a number of different segments. And so not only the creamer products that did really well. But our coffee, our performance mushrooms are greens, are bars. Everything is it's really doing well on Amazon right now. And a couple of things happened. One was we got inventory back into place just as you asked about. So we've done, I would say, are to keep our team has done an exceptional job of reselling and managing, especially in light of the surging demand because there is a little bit of a lag to restock into their micro DCs team has done an excellent job in that space, but they've also gone out and won back the buy box for our products where we had resellers, you know, you're always fighting resellers. It's a little bit of a game of whack-a-mole, honestly, as one you knock one down and then another one pops up with your product at a discounted price where they happen to pick up two or three products at their local grocery on sale. So we've been doing a really nice job of knocking that down. We've hired an agency to help with some of that. And we I would say that we've just been executing that channel really well operationally. And at the same time, we did invest. We found we've had some really strong returns on some of the ads that we've created in the search that we've been able to execute. And so we've had done some really great commercial and operational execution there for the last quarter.\n\nThat's.\n\nThat's helpful.\r\n Thank you.\r\n And then the next question I wanted to ask about on your hydration business. It grew a lot year over year my sense is maybe that's driven from the greens product, correct me if I'm wrong. And if that's the case, I'm just I'm wondering how you're going to keep calm sort of pushing like what's the plan behind that, your expectation to continue growing that product? And like what how are you going to continue to kind of broaden it?\r\n And so yes, there would be deals?\r\n Yes, you're at your intuition is exactly right, George. It is largely the greens product that has been providing that growth. And I would say the greens and the reds. We launched a sister product to our greens called. It's called the daily reds, which is a kind of a heart health on ancillary product and similar to the greens, how each of the bulk of those are made exclusively from fruits and vegetables. They are the cleanest products on the market. We're marketing them as such. And what we're finding is that there's been a there's a significant market that's been created in the country for a daily greens product. And I'll stay with that for a moment because that's less than the 95 to the five, probably the category, if not more. And what we're finding is that based on our cost structure now we can have the best pacing our best efficacy product on the market had a lower cost than a lower price than some of our competitors. And that's turning out to be a tremendous opportunity for us. And I think we're just getting started in this space. We have some really strong marketing that's coming and behind it, some some really great activations that we're doing. And what we're finding is that once consumers flip over to become subscribers on that product. They're really stick with us on a daily basis that turns into a great long-term relationship with them.\r\n And is that product sold exclusively online.\r\n It's not it's where we started. We launched it. And I would say this is generally our launch pattern is to launch first in our own website or Laird Superfood TTC. website. We take all the learnings behind that and use that also as a way, by offering those early exclusivities to consumers as a reward for shopping on our site but then we broaden it from there. So we've launched it into Amazon. And in fact, we have it out now in a number of retailers, a growing number of retailers in the natural food space.\r\n Okay, great.\r\n And then last question for me. I'm just trying to sort of map out your year when it comes to getting to your annual revenue guidance and how that should look quarterly? Is there much seasonality in the business has been kind of in flux for a little while now? And so I'm just trying to map out like what's normal seasonality? Maybe there still still isn't any kind of normal seasonality now that you're sort of back in growth mode, but any any help on mapping out the year would be appreciated.\r\n Yes, George, I'm going to do that. The honest, you've been dying for somebody asked a question, if you could answer.\n\nSo this is going to go to George Yes. So yes, there is some seasonality to our business to fall with the pumpkin creamers and then also holiday season with the peppermint creamers are big seasons for us. So those shipments happen ahead of those on time, so in Q three, so that's where we expect to see seasonality most pronounced in that quarter.\r\n I'm going to, I guess, townhouses and actually feel it on your own?\r\n Yes, I got interrupted. So I had no, I was going to say that I was going to say I don't know.\r\n Go ahead.\r\n You go there must be a delay or something happening in e-commerce, of course, with the prime be happening or actually maybe two prime days in the second half. Thus also, we expect higher seasonality driven by that.\r\n Okay. That's helpful. That's all I had for you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\r\n Thanks, George.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum.\r\n Alex, your line is now open.\r\n Hey, guys.\n\nThanks for taking my question and congratulations on another really good quarter here on. I wanted to ask about your promotions and discounts on notice for most of this year now there's been substantially less discounting activity on your direct to consumer side. Your and really any sales you've done looked like they've been pretty targeted on either to specific items or very, very limited on time type sales. So just wondering if you've had any meaningful customer churn as a result of this or if maybe some of your customers have been ordering less as these discounts have come down. Obviously, customers of yours aren't pulling back too much considering you're raising your revenue guidance for the year. But if you can just talk to us at all about how customer behavior may have changed as you've become a lot less promotional? And has it been a little bit harder to go out there and get new customers without without these periodic sales?\r\n Alex, good to hear from you and good question. Yes, you know, we just had this discussion. We had quite a lot recently because this really was this was this is the result of a big strategic shift that we had on the DTC. side a couple of years ago when I came in our RDTT. site was essentially a big sales platform set a bunch of products listed not really any content, and we ran it increasingly after the IOS changes that busted Facebook, we ran more and deeper sales in order to top customers in. And what we found as we've actually managed to look at this is we had really taken our brand down market. And so there's been a strategic shift underway for the last 18 months that you're really seeing. Now what you're seeing now is the manifestation of that where we now have. If you go to the PC side, you're going to see in our e-mails, what you'll see is we have an enhanced content strategy. So we're really bringing new news, cultivating some of the stories that are that are out there that were in the world were up that we want to make sure our consumers are aware of with regards to health and wellness and fitness and nutrition and lifestyle and overall wellness around it. And so we cultivate those we bring into Laird and Gabby specific content. We include other content that we're able And linked to that, that we feel is some advantageous to our consumers and give them a reason to be there. And in doing that, we've also pulled back on the level of promotion. We did take price up on the channel a while back, we pulled back promotion, but we left a really nice subscription benefit. And what this has done behaviorally to your question is it's allowed us to pick up a much larger set of subscribers. So I mentioned in that pre record that we've turn consumers into buyers and buyers and repeat buyers and repeat buyers and subscribers. And that's the funnel kind of that virtuous cycle that we're really trying to pull people through it as we do that they improve their health and we are able to lock in a consumer for a longer period of time, obviously, and usually into more products. And so it's really a harmonious and win-win for the consumer and for us when we're able to do that. So about right, around 50% of our total DTC sales are now subscriptions. All those subscriptions are coming at a discount. So you're getting essentially our best sales. Typically, our best sale that we run is going to be that free shipping plus 20% off that subscribers receive. We do now a couple of just a couple of events through the year with very few sales. But what we do with the very big batch of Black Friday is one of those and we tried to execute those very minimally so that we're able to really retain that premium brand image that we're seeking to have.\r\n Okay.\r\n That's really helpful. Thanks for that.\r\n Jason. And then just one on the numbers, your returns and discounts as you report your sales by category, um, you know, it looks like the lowest rate of returns and discounts you've had in about a year and a half kind of continuing on that trend moving in the right direction last quarter, was there anything in particular that's really driven that improvement and should we expect to see that improved results sustained throughout this year?\n\nYes, Alex, this is Anya. Thanks for the question. I'll take the phone and yes, so I would say that was also the outcome of our strategic shift and how we think about trade and promotional strategy and to DTC that you just asked about is certainly contributing to that strength but also our wholesale business with retail and club business specifically. And we have invented our promotional approach there to really tried to cut out any inefficient trade and really focus on programs that directly impact consumers and drive all loss base itself.\n\nSo okay, I think that's really helpful.\n\nAnd I think that's yes. And we and that's to continue throughout the rest of the year.\n\nTerrific. Thank you very much.\r\n Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, there are no further questions registered in the queue. As a final reminder, if you would like to ask a question star followed by a one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause here briefly to allow any remaining questions to be registered. You may do not have any further questions registered in the queue. So I will turn the call back over for any final concluding remarks.\r\n I'd just like to thank all of you for once again joining us on the call as you know, for us, this has gotten more and more exciting each quarter. This has clearly been a story. And over the last six quarters or so, has been a turnaround and down. It's nice to be coming through that and be able to indicate that we're on the cusp of really big some big growth numbers against this business. And in this quarter. It was the first to really bear that out, but it's still very much in line with the guidance that we had previous previously, critically given So and I feel like we're doing what we said we were aiming to do, and I'm really excited to bring the next quarters in and continue that same story. So thanks, everybody, for joining.\r\n That concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect your lines.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Affirm Holdings Selloff Is 'Baffling': Analysts Dive Into Financial Results\n\nShares of Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) were climbing in early trading on Thursday, after dropping more than 9% on Wednesday, after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter results.\n\nThe results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways.\n\nJPMorgan On Affirm Holdings\n\nAnalyst Reginald Smith upgraded the rating from Neutral to Overweight, while raising the price target from $41 to $43.\n\nThe steep decline in Affirm's shares on Wednesday, despite the company posting another headline and operating margin beat and announcing a better-than-feared GMV outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter, \"was baffling,\" Smith said in a note. Affirm Card active cardholders surpassed the one million mark, rising from 700,000 in the previous quarter, he added.\n\nPay Now is increasing as a percentage of Card GMV, \"which may be a sign of progress towards becoming a top-of-wallet card,\" the analyst wrote. \"In light of strong recent performance, Affirm is beginning to open their risk aperture, which includes offering better credits lower APRs to drive incremental GMV growth, as well as expanding their credit box at the margin,\" he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs On Affirm Holdings\n\nAnalyst Michael Ng reiterated a Neutral rating, while lifting the price target from $20 to $21.\n\nAffirm raised its full-year GMV guidance, \"driven by the outperformance in the quarter & continued momentum in the business,\" Ng said. GMV growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter to 36% year-on-year, with volumes from the company's top five merchants growing faster than the overall business, he added.\n\nAffirm Card generated GMV of $374 million in the fiscal third quarter, \"which currently has more than 1 million active card holders,\" the analyst wrote. \"Affirm Card has seen strong use in categories that AFRM historically has not addressed (e.g., restaurants, groceries, fuel),\" he added.\n\nCheck out other analyst stock ratings.\n\nMizuho Securities On Affirm Holdings\n\nAnalyst Dan Dolev reaffirmed a Buy rating and price target of $65.\n\nThe decline in Affirm's shares, following \"a fantastic F3Q\" with upbeat GMV and outlook, is likely in sympathy with Shopify Inc's (NASDAQ:SHOP) stock, which fell on \"soft guidance and opex concerns,\" Dolev said.\n\nThe reaction appears \"overblown,\" as Shopify accounts for merely about 10% of Affirm's gross merchandize value versus around 20% for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the analyst states. \"We believe the initial post-earning upward move in the stock is more appropriate for AFRM, and recommend buying on the strength of the fundamentals vs. kneejerk negative stock reaction,\" he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeedham On Affirm Holdings\n\nAnalyst Kyle Peterson maintained a Hold rating on the stock.\n\nAffirm reported its quarterly results ahead of the Street’s expectations, \"though most of the upside was due to lending-related revenue (interest, gain on sale, servicing), which we believe warrants a lower valuation from investors compared to network revenue,\" Peterson wrote in a note. He added that the company's allowance for credit losses rose on both a sequential and year-on-year basis.\n\n\"While delinquencies remain stable, we expect some increased anxiety in response to the higher allowance given the current stage of the credit cycle,\" the analyst further stated.\n\nAFRM Price Action: Shares of Affirm Holdings were up 4.6% to $33.06 at the time of publication on Thursday.\n\nNow Read: Unemployment Claims Surge More Than Expected, Hit 8-Month Peak: Dollar Falls As Traders Bet On Rate Cuts\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for AFRM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Barclays Maintains Overweight Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral Feb 2022 Jefferies Downgrades Hold Underperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AFRM\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Affirm Holdings Selloff Is 'Baffling': Analysts Dive Into Financial Results originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Amazon’s New Fees on Sellers Likened  to 'Kick in the Gut'",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. merchants have found themselves caught in an economic vice.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings ‘Seriously Underwater’ Home Mortgages Tick Up Across the US Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Marjorie Taylor Greene Finally Got What She Deserved: Defeat\n\nEarlier this year, the e-commerce giant rolled out changes to the fees its charges them — essentially shifting more of its operating costs onto the small businesses that account for most of the products sold on the site. Making matters worse for merchants, shoppers are trading down.\n\nIn the first four months of the year, American consumers have increasingly opted for the least expensive products in nearly all categories, according to a report released Thursday by Adobe Inc. That makes it harder to pass price hikes along to shoppers, and online merchants are struggling to make money.\n\nDuncan Freer, who sells weighted blankets and sleep masks on Amazon, expects his profit margin to slide to 8% from 20% as a result of the new fees. One, imposed in March, charges a levy on shipments sent to the company’s fulfillment centers. That will drive the cost of shipping two pallets of Freer’s products to Amazon to more than $800, up four-fold from what it cost him in October, he said. Amazon reduced the cost of fulfilling each customer order, but Freer said it only partially offsets the new fees.\n\n“Amazon just keeps grabbing more and more,” said the Chicago businessman, whose sales on the marketplace amount to about $500,000 a year. “It’s like a kick in the gut.”\n\nAmazon said the new fees are intended to reflect its own cost of distributing inventory around the US so more items can be delivered in just one day, which helps boost overall sales for online merchants. Some fees actually went down. In January, Amazon cut commissions for sellers of low-cost apparel, a move interpreted by merchants as an effort to blunt competition from Chinese fast-fashion startup Shein.\n\n“When we announced these new fee changes in December, we estimated that sellers will on average see an increase of $0.15 per unit sold, which is significantly less than the average fee increases announced by other fulfillment service providers,” company spokeswoman Mira Dix said in an emailed statement. “As sellers are adapting to these changes we have seen that the actual impact is even lower, and many more sellers are seeing a decrease in the average fees that they are paying to Amazon.”\n\nStill, many merchants say Amazon is mostly benefiting from the higher fees, an assertion reflected in the company’s earnings. Revenue from seller services, which includes the popular Fulfillment by Amazon logistics operation, increased at a faster rate than fulfillment expenses in each of the past seven quarters. Amazon’s seller services revenue of $34.6 billion for the period ended March 30 was up 36.5% from two years earlier, more than triple the pace of growth of its fulfillment costs, which were $22.3 billion in the period.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn last month’s earnings report, the cloud computing division’s strong performance overshadowed the growing tension between Amazon and its sellers. Amazon Web Services in the first quarter contributed more than 60% of the company’s operating income even though it accounts for less than 20% of revenue. But sales in the core e-commerce business grew at a slower pace than the number of units sold, another indication that consumers are watching their budgets. Amazon’s marketplace model helps the company keep growing through a slowdown by charging fees for advertising and logistics.\n\nAntonio Bindi, a Brazilian businessman who has sold home storage and kitchen products on Amazon for five years, said the fee structure is getting increasingly complex. Of particular concern: a levy introduced in April charged when sellers’ inventory runs low. That’s on top of previous storage fees that increase when slow-selling inventory lingers in Amazon warehouses. It’s too much for his 20-person team to manage, so he’s whittling his catalog of 500 products down to 400 to simplify the operation.\n\nFive years ago, he said, “Amazon was a platform that would facilitate your business operations and let you focus on what you’re good at, like creating great products. You could just send your products to Amazon, and they’d take care of everything. Now you need an entire department to deal with the complexity. The costs are prohibitive.”\n\nSan Francisco seller Neil Ayton sells golf yardage books, yoga gear and pickleball equipment. One of his most popular products is a yoga stick practitioners use to stretch. It was 59 inches, the longest it could be to avoid a higher fee tier. Earlier this year, he noticed Amazon cut the size limit, and suddenly his yoga sticks were one inch too long. Shipping costs for each product jumped from $10 to $26, and Ayton began losing $3 per sale. He recalled hundreds of yoga sticks from Amazon warehouses and trimmed an inch off each one, but said doing so merely minimized his losses. Now he plans to wind down his Amazon business.\n\n“Amazon kind of teases you,” Ayton said. “It’s great when it’s working nicely, but you never know what surprise is coming tomorrow.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "This is the Amazon everyone should have feared",
        "content": "A little less than six years ago, I wrote an article with a similar headline to this newsletter.\n\nAt the time, Amazon had once again posted its largest quarterly profit in history—$2.5 billion at the time—on the back of its two fastest-growing businesses that hadn’t even existed when Jeff Bezos took the company public: Amazon Web Services and Amazon Advertising.\n\n“An Amazon that is posting growing profits from its non-core business,” I wrote back in 2018, “means an Amazon that can continue to keep prices low and invest in ever-speedier delivery times to widen its defensive moat in its main retail business. That should be a very scary realization for rivals.”\n\nAnd it mostly has been. Fast forward to last week, when Amazon announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Amazon’s net income surpassed $10 billion for the quarter and would have exceeded $12 billion if not for a $2 billion non-cash expense from its investment in the electric carmaker Rivian.\n\nOn the revenue side, its year-over-year growth rates accelerated across the board, for its AWS, advertising, and core e-commerce divisions, respectively. That’s a revenue acceleration even as AWS is on track to surpass $100 billion in annual sales by the end of 2024, while its investments in what could be a transformational technology of generative AI are just ramping up. The law of large numbers doesn’t seem to be holding AWS back.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon’s ad business should top $50 billion for the first time in 2024, and that’s with the tech giant just starting to really court TV advertisers to buy ads on Prime Video, thanks to its deal to stream NFL games—and, soon, NBA basketball games too.\n\nOver the decade-plus that I’ve covered this company, it’s become common for stock analysts to ask Amazon officials on earnings calls whether the company is currently operating in more of an investing cycle than a profits one, or vice versa. And on last week’s earnings call, an analyst posed such a question once again. But the answer was much different than ever before.\n\n“I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the call. “I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses—in the stores business along with advertising and AWS—there's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think…we don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side.”\n\nFor the first time in a very long time—maybe in the company’s 30-year history—Amazon is at a point where it can afford “to do both.” That’s noteworthy.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be clear, the company is facing myriad challenges, including some self-induced. Its plans to reinvent brick-and-mortar shopping through technology haven’t gone as planned. The Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, however unlikely, could someday force the company to overhaul its business or even split it into parts. Amazon’s relationship with the hundreds of thousands of sellers who account for 60% of the company’s product sales has probably never been worse no matter what Amazon’s CEO says. And as the nascent generative AI sector has boomed, Amazon has found itself in some instances trailing competitors.\n\nBut for today, considering the financial results Amazon is showing, and considering the fact that the company is finally at a size that it can, as Jassy said on the earnings call, both invest aggressively in its future while also pumping out real profits, this certainly feels like the Amazon everyone should have feared.\n\nAgain.\n\nJason Del Rey\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThe rest of today’s Data Sheet was written by David Meyer.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Amazon (AMZN) is a Great Choice",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Amazon (AMZN), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AMZN that show why this online retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor AMZN, shares are up 3.67% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry is up 1.77% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 1.1% compares favorably with the industry's 0.55% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Amazon have increased 9.95% over the past quarter, and have gained 70.61% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.14% and 27.07%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to AMZN's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. AMZN is currently averaging 45,585,900 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AMZN.\n\nOver the past two months, 12 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AMZN's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.06 to $4.54 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 12 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that AMZN is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Amazon on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Google – The Battle For AI Dominance\n\nCommentators highlighted Microsoft’s exceptional leadership and its dominance in AI talent as key indicators of strength. Despite criticisms about its AI capabilities, particularly compared to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), known as Google, Microsoft’s strategic application of AI has been a standout feature. Its multifaceted approach, spanning cloud computing, software development, gaming, hardware design, search, advertising, and acquisitions like GitHub and LinkedIn, underscores its status as a diversified powerhouse. “It’s more like a mini etf itself,” commented Redditor St3w1e0.\n\nComment\r\n byu/Physioweng from discussion\r\n instocks\n\nThe debate over AI leadership between Microsoft and Google sparked further analysis. While Google is recognized for its innovative prowess, commentators noted Microsoft’s practical application and superior execution in AI.\n\nMicrosoft’s ability to find real-world applications for AI technologies has given it an edge, contrasting with Google’s struggles to maintain product continuity.\n\nAlso Read: Google’s DeepMind Co-Founder Mustafa Suleyman, Shares His Exciting First Month At Microsoft: ‘Truly Transformational’\n\nMicrosoft Vs.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com (AMZN) Outperforming Other Retail-Wholesale Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "The Retail-Wholesale group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Is Amazon (AMZN) one of those stocks right now? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Retail-Wholesale peers, we might be able to answer that question.\n\nAmazon is a member of our Retail-Wholesale group, which includes 213 different companies and currently sits at #14 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN's full-year earnings has moved 15.9% higher within the past quarter. This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock's earnings outlook is more positive.\n\nOur latest available data shows that AMZN has returned about 23.7% since the start of the calendar year.

Welcome to Instacart's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Rebecca Yoshiyama, VP of Investor Relations, Capital Markets and Treasury. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Yoshiyama\n\nThank you, Josh, and welcome, everyone, to Instacart's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Fidji Simo, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Giovanni, our current Chief Financial Officer; and Emily Reuter, our current Vice President of Finance and incoming Chief Financial Officer. After brief prepared remarks, we will open up the call for live questions with Fidji and Emily.\r\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements related to our business plans and strategy, future performance and prospects, including our expectations regarding financial results, partnerships, equity, issuances and share repurchases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. You can find more information about these risks and uncertainties, including those related to the classification of shoppers on our platform in our last Form 10-K filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these statements after today's call, except as required by law.\r\nIn addition, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, which have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from or a substitute for our GAAP results. A reconciliation between these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included in our shareholder letter, which can be found on our Investor Relations website.\r\nNow I'll turn the call over to Fidji for her opening remarks.\r\nThanks, Rebecca. Hi, everyone. I hope you had a chance to read our shareholder letter, which highlights our strong start to 2024 and how we're continuing to raise the bar across all the most important dimensions of groceries. As the largest online grocery marketplace in North America, we provide 98% of families with access to delivery and pickup from over 1,500 retail banners who represent more than 85% of U.S. grocery sales.\r\nOn top of the best selection, 45% of our orders are accepted by shoppers who are already at or within a mile of the store, which means your first item is often being picked out faster than it might take you to get out the front door. Our shoppers also have the advantages of experience and our technology. With shopper tenure on the platform at an all-time high, constant improvements to our models and in-store tools like planograms, shoppers can complete orders faster and with more accuracy. Simply put, no other marketplace offers the leading customer experience we provide at the scale and competitive cost we deliver it at.\r\nAnd now by partnering with Uber, we are giving people more of what they're looking for. By bringing on hundreds of thousands of restaurants to Instacart overnight, we're creating an unmatched combination of grocery and restaurant options for Instacart customers. The Instacart app can now serve more of our customers' food needs, and our Instacart+ membership becomes twice as valuable with no delivery fee on grocery and restaurant orders over $35. By giving our customers more reasons to turn to Instacart, we believe we'll also be able to drive more sales and growth opportunities for our retail and brand partners, which remains our top priority. \r\nOverall, I'm excited for what's ahead for Instacart in 2024 and beyond. We have a strong operating foundation of relentless focus on profitable growth, and we're executing well on our vision to build the technologies that are transforming the grocery industry.\r\nSo it is with great confidence that we announce Emily Reuter as our next Chief Financial Officer. Nick will retire at the end of Q2, and Emily's role is effective immediately after we file our Form 10-Q, which is expected later this week. As Nick and I discussed the best CFO profile for our future business, I wanted someone with a depth of operating experience in a complex marketplace business similar to our own. We found out and more in Emily, and she's been contributing enormously since she joined in January. Emily is undoubtedly the best CFO to help drive Instacart's future.\r\nI want to thank Nick for his exceptional contributions over the past few years. By instituting a new level of financial rigor across the company, Nick helped transform our business into one that delivers strong profitable growth and was one of very few tech companies that could make a successful public market debut last year. \r\nNow I'll turn the call over to Nick to provide a few remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nNick Giovanni\n\nThank you, Fidji. It has been an incredible 3.5 years, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished together at Instacart. The level of execution and teamwork required to create a sustainable, profitable and growing company and then to take it public after the longest tech IPO drought in history was one of the most satisfying experiences I've had in my career. Instacart is in a great position as the clear leader with strong operating fundamentals. And after working closely with Emily over these past several months, I'm certain that our team, our partners and our shareholders cannot be in better hands. It has been a pleasure engaging with all of our investors and analysts over the past few years. Thank you all.\r\nAnd with that, I'll step off the call and turn it over to Emily.\n\nEmily Reuter\n\nThank you, Fidji and Nick. Since joining Instacart in January, I've become even more bullish on the company's future. I joined Instacart because of its clear leadership position with an online grocery and its impressive vision for the future of grocery technology. I'm now even more confident in our ability to capture our share of the massive market opportunity ahead.\r\nMy confidence is driven by a few things: the depth of our technology integrations as well as the breadth of our long-standing retailer and brand partnerships; our ability to deliver a great customer experience. This means having the best selection combined with high-quality service all at the price and speed customers wanted; our cost serve advantage, underpinned by our ability to fulfill multiple big basket grocery orders from the same store at the same time. This allows us to generate efficiencies from batching while also giving shoppers more earnings opportunities; and finally, we aren't just focused on delivering results for the next few quarters or years. We're investing in technologies that will shape the future of grocery and grow the pie for all our stakeholders.\r\nI could not be more excited to work with our teams to drive even more profitable growth for Instacart as we work to further extend our lead across all of these dimensions. I also want to thank Nick for his support over these past few months and Fidji for her inspiring and collaborative partnership from day one. \r\nNow let me provide more color on our financial results and outlook. Q1 was an exceptionally strong quarter for us with both GTV and adjusted EBITDA beating the high end of our guidance ranges. On one hand, our outperformance in GTV was driven by a continuation of trends we've been discussing. This includes improving cohort dynamics consistent with what we've said in the past, which is our mature cohort declines continued to improve, and our new cohorts continue to be bigger than pre-pandemic cohorts. It also includes a lessening year-over-year EBT SNAP headwind, which had the biggest impact in Q4 and a smaller impact in Q1, primarily because of the successful EBT SNAP launches with Kroger and Costco. \r\nOn the other hand, our year-over-year GTV growth in Q1 also benefited from a number of onetime things. This included just over 1 percentage point of growth from leap day in addition to a stronger-than-expected seasonality as Q1 2024 was an exceptionally bad winter season, especially compared to the prior year quarter. After taking all of these factors into consideration as well as what we've seen so far in this quarter, we arrived at our Q2 GTV guidance of $8 billion to $8.15 billion, representing 7% to 9% year-over-year growth. This growth outlook is a bit lower than Q1, primarily because we don't expect the benefit of inclement weather. While Q2 growth will not have the benefit of leap day, we largely expect this to be offset by EBT SNAP moving from a modest year-over-year headwind to a tailwind from Q1 to Q2. Overall, our Q2 GTV outlook represents a sustained step-up versus the 5% year-over-year growth we delivered in 2023.\r\nWe are also guiding to strong Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $180 million to $190 million and are well on track to delivering adjusted EBITDA expansion in full year 2024 on both an absolute and percent of GTV basis. One important thing to note about our adjusted EBITDA outlook is it reflects our ability to manage multiple levers across our P&L to drive leverage.\r\nIn Q2, we expect advertising and other revenue to grow largely in line with what we experienced over the past 2 quarters. This means our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of GTV is expected to grow year-over-year, primarily driven by transaction revenue and adjusted OpEx leverage.\r\nWe are also continuing to take a disciplined approach to equity management. We continue to expect net dilution to be in the low single digits before any share repurchases. And in 2024, we are committed to making sure that the net value of equity we grant employees this year is less than the adjusted EBITDA we delivered in 2023. We are confident in our ability to execute and generate more shareholder value over time. This is why we cumulatively repurchased approximately 27 million shares for $751 million by the end of Q1. As of March 31, we had $249 million of remaining share repurchase capacity and plan to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares.\r\nOverall, our business is performing well and our operating fundamentals are solid. We remain relentlessly focused on making our service better, deepening our leadership position and innovating with new technologies like Caper and our partnership with Uber. While we don't expect these new growth initiatives to materially impact our financials in Q2, we believe that they have the potential to drive more value to consumers and growth to our retail and brand partners over time. We also expect all of this will help us drive more profitable growth and progress towards our long-term financial targets over time.\r\nWe're excited about the future, and we appreciate your support as shareholders. With that, Fidji and I are here to take your questions. Operator, you may now begin.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\n\nNick, thanks for all the assistance and help over the years. And Emily, best of luck in the role going forward. Maybe I'll ask sort of a two-parter. In terms of the building blocks of GTV growth as you think medium to longer term, can you unpack how you're thinking about the broader consumer demand on the platform, the input of sort of continued supply growth more broadly and how to think about simulating rising utility amongst your user base as we think about sort of longer-term objectives around GTV against broader industry growth?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nThanks, Eric, for the question. So we are still very excited about the long-term growth that we anticipate in a market that is still moving online and still deeply underpenetrated online. What we see as the building blocks of that long-term growth are kind of the same things that are making us succeed today and allowing us to have this leadership position.\r\nNumber one is selection. We continue to have leading selection. And we are, in fact, continuing to increase the selection not just in grocery but now also adding a new use case with restaurants. We were able to add hundreds of thousands of restaurants overnight, which will create a new use case for the app.\r\nQuality is absolutely critical. You can see in the letter more details on how we continue to improve that and be at an all-time high since the pandemic on found rate and fill rate. And we have a real leadership position there with not only a very healthy shopper; supply but shoppers that are highly qualified and at the highest of their tenure right now.\r\nWe also see speed being a critical advantage, which, again, is tied to our shopper supply with 45% of shoppers being at the store -- within a mile of the store. And that means that we can deliver these orders faster than anyone, and we know that speed matters enormously in this market.\r\nThe last one is affordability. That remains the thing that we need to keep working out to continue expanding the TAM, and we are hard at work on it through a multipronged approach, where we are adding a lot of different savings whether it's from retailers, from CPGs, loyalty programs, weekly flyers and really working with retailers on optimizing their pricing so that the customer that buys online feel like they are getting maximum value. And you're seeing us make progress on that as well with $4.75 saved on items per order, which is up 20% year-over-year.\r\nSo these components aren't changing. They are what's going to drive long-term growth. And every quarter, you're going to hear us talk about how we're making progress on all of them to really activate the growth. \r\nNow at a macro level, we are -- we have also talked about the fact that mature cohorts improving quarter after quarter, as we saw again this quarter, is definitely a big driver of long-term growth as well as new cohorts continuing to get bigger, which is certainly what we've seen in '23 and now in '24 compared to pre-pandemic. So we feel very well set up for the long term.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein.\n\nNikhil Vijay Devnani\n\nI wanted to ask about reinvestment, please. It looks like your transaction revenue stepped up a bit sequentially, and sales and marketing was sort of flattish as a percent of GTV sequentially as well. Given you beat the guidance pretty comfortably on EBITDA, did you look at the possibility of reinvesting some of that excess profit to support growth for the rest of the year? I guess why not go on the front foot more? Was it simply a lack of ROI on some of that investment? Or did other factors come into play as well?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nSo I want to be clear that we actually did reinvest to support growth, and that's not always seen in the sales and marketing line. Sometimes it's seen in the incentive line, which is contra-revenue. And the reason we have been able to reinvest to support growth while having high confidence that this will return is because we have really overhold of an incentive system in the last year to be able to really target the right incentives to the right customers at the right time to drive long-term value, to drive habituation, to drive more engaged customers.\r\nAnd so what you're seeing us do is actually reinvest heavily into the business to continue to support that growth. That may not appear in the numbers immediately because we take a long-term view to this reinvestment. And so some of these incentives or marketing might be driven at long-term retention, like, for example, getting you to adopt one more retailer or one more category or buying from a club, all of which are predictors of long-term retention and higher LTV. And so you might see that pay off over the longer term rather than in quarter. But we are very much investing in the business and don't feel limited in our ability to invest.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\n\nFidji, just a couple of questions on these partnerships. So I guess, first, maybe we can clear the air on the Amazon elephant in the room. You guys work with Whole Foods in Canada. Sounds like Amazon is going to go another push here with their new pricing mechanism for Prime in the U.S. I guess what's your view on that? And is there any reason why, at some point in the future, not exclusive or whatever, you couldn't go back to working with Whole Foods? That would be first question.\r\nAnd then the second one is on the Uber partnership. I guess just how big do you think this could be? And do you think that restaurant ordering will be just folks that are IC+ members who kind of order a la carte from food delivery apps? Or do you think there's like a high overlap of DashPass subscribers that might come over and use Instacart now?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nThanks, Ross. So on Amazon specifically, I would say Amazon has experimented with many different pricing structures over the years. We have been testing this add-on subscription for some time. And within this construct, we remain very confident that we still have the winning customer value prop and some critical advantages. We have the best selection, 1,500 retail partners, reaching 98% of households. We know how much selection matters in this market. That's a key advantage. \r\nWe also have a key advantage on speed. As I said, 80% of our orders are on demand, half of which are priority, whereas in the case of Amazon, you have to schedule orders far in advance. And we know, again, that speed matters enormously in this market.\r\nAnd we really have the best value with Instacart+ being $99 a year, now twice as valuable with the addition of restaurants and not requiring an extra subscription. So we feel really good that under any construct from this competitor, we will be able to continue gaining share as we have in the past.\r\nWe work with them in Canada. We are pleased with the results. There is no reason why we wouldn't be able to expand to Whole Foods, but that's their decision, not ours. We would be thrilled to work with them, but that's for them to decide.\r\nNow on the Uber side, I'm really excited about the partnership. I think this is adding enormous selection overnight at positive unit economics, which, as you know, is really hard to pull off when you enter a completely new category. So we think this is something that's going to be incredibly accretive to the Instacart user.\r\nAnd on your more specific question on which type of usage do we see, we actually see that we have a lot of incremental audiences that Uber does not have especially in family, especially in the suburbs, which is a big part of why this partnership is also valuable to them, and we are going to be aggressively wanting to convert these customers into restaurant customers. We know that our customers already go to other apps to order restaurants. That's why we decided to prioritize entering this category. And I think with the value proposition of Instacart+, which is not increasing in price despite adding all restaurants and free delivery above $35 from both grocery and restaurants, we have a very strong value proposition here with leading selection in grocery and leading selection in restaurants. So we're really excited about our ability to attract new users and convert our existing users to become restaurant customers as well and as a result, make them more engaged.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\n\nJason Stuart Helfstein\n\nJust 2 questions. So you had some comments about expanding to pickup. Just how do you think about like what are the savings that a customer gets when they do pickup? And do you think this better positions you to compete with Walmart for online grocery?\r\nAnd the second question just to Uber. Can the economics work to expand the partnership so that they would actually offer your grocery offering on their app? So open-ended question on that.\n\nFidji Simo\n\nSo on pickup. Pickup is a big part of our affordability strategy because it is a cheaper option for people who value price over convenience. And so that's why we're focused on it, and that's why we actually made it free this quarter to use pickup. So to your point on the savings, it's a great option for people who may not have the time to get inside the store and want to benefit from those time savings but don't want to pay the cost of delivery. And we see that it is, in fact, a different customer because 75% of pickup orders are incremental.\r\nNow pickup is a smaller part of our overall business in big part because we started with grocery, but it's the part that continues to grow, and we continue to expand with large grocers like Kroger, Albertsons, many more to continue to grow the pickup business. So we're excited about it, but it is a smaller part of our overall business.\r\nAs for your question on Uber and grocery, to be clear, this partnership was very focused about us entering restaurants. We are still going to compete in grocery. And we continue to have leading category share in grocery, so this is something that we're excited to continue further.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.\n\nColin Alan Sebastian\n\nNick, all the best to you on your next steps. And Emily, welcome and congrats. Looking at the advertising revenue opportunity, this seems like still an area that's a significant opportunity as you engage with more CPG and brand advertisers. And so looking at that business, looking at the take rate, if you could perhaps maybe update us on the road map there? Any specific platform enhancements or products this year that we should pay attention to and ultimately, Fidji, your vision for advertising on the platform?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nAbsolutely. So we still have very high conviction on our long-term targets, which are that advertising would reach 4% to 5% of GTV over time. It will not be linear. If you look at the last couple of years, advertising has grown very fast over the last couple of years. And so that's something that has changed in the last few quarters, mostly as we've told you before, because ad growth lagged GTV growth, and we haven't seen ads fully catch up yet.\r\nBut our conviction around the long-term model is very strong. The reason we have this conviction is because we continue adding more and more partnership to measure the performance of our ad and optimize that, and the results always come back showing that we are an incredible place for advertisers to place their dollars.\r\nYou have seen that probably in the latter with our partnership with Circana. We continue to launch new objectives and optimization capabilities like, for example, new-to-brand objective and target ROAS this quarter. And so all of these capabilities are really contributing to giving brands confidence that we have a channel by which they are going to see high return, high sales lead, high incrementality.\r\nIn terms of what to pay attention to, in addition to these measurement improvements, targeting, et cetera, which is really our bread and butter, we have extended the strength of our ad platform beyond the world of the Instacart app. You have seen us do partnership with Google, recently NBCU, The Trade Desk, where we are taking the data and the strength of our targeting and our audiences and applying it to advertising platforms outside of Instacart.\r\nWe have taken a similar approach with Carrot Ads, where we power ads on our retailers' website, whether that's [Props], Schnucks, many more. And that's also a way to continue growing the ad business. \r\nAnd then finally, expanding [this ad] business inside the store on Caper with Caper Carts, which is obviously small right now given that we have hundreds of carts out there. But as we ramp up to 1,000, of course, this is something that will get a lot bigger, especially as you look to 2025. So overall, like we feel very confident about the performance of our ad. Some initiatives take time, but we feel good about our trajectory.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\n\nEmily, can you provide any more color on what you're seeing across cohorts and if you see a time frame for mature cohorts, those declines to flatten out? And then anything that you can help us understand around the benefits of the new partnerships with Kroger and Costco on EBT SNAP and on quantifying just as you flip from a headwind to tailwind over -- into 2Q?\n\nEmily Reuter\n\nThanks for the question, Doug. So on cohorts, what I'd say is that everything that we've said about cohort dynamics remains true. So our mature cohort declines continued to improve in the quarter, and new cohorts are bigger than pre-pandemic. What I would note, though, is that the strong Q1 performance that we saw benefited all of our cohorts. And so for that reason, I would expect that there was some acceleration and improvement in Q1 that we don't expect to repeat in Q2 given those onetime impacts. So overall, I think the underlying trends continue to move along the same trends with the onetime impact in Q1.\r\nAs it relates to the benefit of the new partnerships on EBT, overall, what I'd say is that the year-over-year headwind improved from Q4 to Q1. So the impact was strongest in Q4. And in Q1, the launches of Kroger and Costco helped mitigate that impact. As we move into Q2, we do expect to lap the expiration of those benefits. But the overall impact is modest. The way that I think about it is that the EBT SNAP benefit in Q2 would effectively offset the impact that we had in Q1 from leap day, so about 1 percentage point of growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson.\n\nMichael Paul Morton\n\nTwo if I could. They're related. Could you speak to the defensibility and contract length of some of the largest and exclusive relationships? It's a question that we frequently get from the investor base. And any clarity there? And we do appreciate that it's not essential to the success of your business, but it's FAQ.\r\nAnd related to partnerships, I would love to know how you think longer term when it comes to working with the likes of Walmart and Amazon. Research shows that they're taking share in grocery and could be taking share from your core customer base on the grocer side. And a lot of times, they like to pull things in-house eventually. So is there any risk that you're feeding the beast and bridging them to their own sustainable solutions?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nThanks for the question. So on contract length and exclusivity, first off, I just want to remind everyone that exclusivity is not our strategy. The strategy is fundamentally to be the partner of choice by being very embedded in grocers' business because we drive growth for them.\r\nAs for the contracts, they are, I would say, 1 to 2 years, and they all have different timing. So it's not as if there is a cliff coming up at any point. And what we usually see is that when retailers go nonexclusive and go to other platforms, what happens is that they continue to grow with us, invest more in the relationship, and the use case that happens on other platforms is quite different from our own. It ends up being very small baskets, the thing that you add after a restaurant order, like a bag of chips and a can of Pepsi, and so very different from what they can do on our platform, which is really everything from small baskets to large baskets.\r\nAnd so we continue to invest in our technology with grocers. We have a relationship even when they're not exclusive. We are very open. We power their owned and operated business. We power their fulfillment. We do pickup with them. We do EBT SNAPs. We do virtual convenience. The list goes on, and it's obviously a much more strategic relationship than just sitting on a marketplace. So that's very much how we think about this.\r\nIn terms of partnership and long-term working with competitors, I would say what we obsess over is always having the best possible selection for our customers, and that's what got us to have a selection that represent 85% of U.S. gross retail being on Instacart. And so that's why we want to work with every grocer. However, when you talk about competitive advantages, we think our competitive advantages are very strong and in particular, when it comes to fulfillment advantages, the scale at which we operate gives us very significant advantages over any retailer wanting to do that themselves.\r\nAnd that's why you are seeing even the largest guys, the Krogers of the world, et cetera, really relying on us for fulfillment because we can do that at economics that are highly competitive, at the scale that is incredibly competitive, with quality that's topnotch, and as a result, we can grow their business rather than them doing that themselves and not growing as fast as they would if they relied on our technology. So we want to make it always the smartest choice for them to partner with us, and that's exactly what has happened to date.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.\n\nAndrew M. Boone\n\nThe NBCUniversal partnership is very interesting. Can you talk about the potential of off-platform advertising and what you need to do to unlock more budget as well as more partners?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nThanks for the question, Andrew. So the way we think about it is that we have really unique customer data that can help advertisers identify audiences, for example, who would be new to their brand, who is an engaged customer that may -- that used to be engaged but may have churned. All of these audiences are incredibly critical for advertisers especially in a world where cookies are going away. And other platforms are really hungry for high-quality third-party data. And so we are able, through our first-party data, to do these partnerships where advertisers are able to take our audiences and leverage that on other platforms to make their advertising on other platforms more performant. And so that's very exciting.\r\nIn addition to that, some of these brands decide to point directly to Instacart because they know that people are going to convert better because they land on a page where the ads allow them to buy and get the product inside their hands within an hour. So it's really a full funnel approach that we have with Google, The Trade Desk, NBCU, and that's why we're really excited to continue deepening these partnerships.\r\nNow in terms of materiality, I would say it is still small because it's a new thing and it requires a new infrastructure and a new muscle. Very often, the people that we talk to, to go get these budgets are different people than the people that are allocating spend on Instacart because they're just allocating spend on other platforms that are more maybe awareness driven or other objectives. So it takes a bit of time to sell this in, build these new relationships, add the new tools to make these services easier to access, optimization capabilities.\r\nBut we've done that in the past with our own platform. We know exactly the playbook. That's the playbook we're applying to this year, and we hope to see the results of that in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nMaybe as a quick follow-up to one of your prior questions, Fidji. I wanted to ask about just the comments in the letter around operating data. I think you have -- you talked about a decade of operating data. And I wanted to just understand the strategic moats that you have as a result of that, both for the consumers and your retail partners because I think that's something that's often discussed.\r\nAnd to that, maybe another question around, I think, the comments on the call around quality -- or in the letter around quality, specifically around receipt analysis and the benefit of LLMs. Just talk to us about the benefits that you gained from that.\n\nFidji Simo\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks for the question. The reason I talked about operating data in the letter is because, very often, we talk about having the best prediction models and things like that, which is incredibly important. I want to be clear. But even if someone literally duplicated right now all of our prediction models, if they didn't have the 10 years of operating data, the model wouldn't be that accurate. You're only as smart as the data you collect.\r\nAnd so what we've done is really amass a large pool of data, both on the consumer side and on the inventory side. On the consumer side, it's 11 to 12 years of large baskets data of everything that customers want to buy, everything that they substitute, which is critical because that allows us, if an item is not on the shelf, to substitute it with something that they prefer.\r\nLots of data about the types of products that are complementary to others that we can surface the best product recommendation and also surface the best ad recommendation. So all of that contributes to a richness of consumer data. That means that when you have invested in Instacart, you have placed a couple of orders, it's really hard to go to another platform because you would have to rebuild your entire basket or rebuild all of your habits, rebuild all of your preferences. And we have all of that for you. And that's why you're seeing, in the letter, we mentioned that 75% of customers have purchased an item from the Buy It Again list because, again, this is data we have on all of their purchase history.\r\nNow on the kind of the shopper side and inventory side, it is also really critical to have data that allows us to predict what's on the shelves. And so again, because we have 600,000 shoppers roaming the aisles of grocery stores and we partner with retailers to get not only their catalog files but their balance-on-hand data, in some cases, we are able to create a system by which we can predict quarter after quarter what's going to be on the shelves with more accuracy, given that we have developed all of these technologies to tell us what's exactly on the shelves right now.\r\nAnd as I've mentioned in previous calls, the biggest compliment that we have on our technology is that some retailers and CPGs are actually using our out-of-stock predictions to optimize their operations because we know what's on the shelves much more in real time, with much more accuracy than retailers and CPGs themselves. And so we see them using our data to optimize their operations.\r\nThen once you have kind of predicted what's on the shelves, you also need shoppers to find the items inside the store. And that's why we have planograms for -- that represents 75% of orders on the platform, so that when the shoppers arrive in the store, they are able to find the item with max efficiency and be able to increase the found rate.\r\nAnd then finally, I mentioned receipt data in the letter because once you're done completing this order and you found the items, sometimes it happens that shoppers could make a mistake. And with receipt data, we're able to tell them in real time now because we can analyze with receipts data, \"Hey, actually, you missed this item. Hey, you might have switched this item into a different order,\" and allow them to self-correct on the spot.\r\nAnd so the combination of all of these technologies is really what gives us massive leadership and results in found rates and fill rates that, again, are at an all-time high since the pandemic. So we're really proud of this system and continue to improve upon them quarter after quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.\n\nThomas Steven Champion\n\nI'd love to hear you talk a little bit about affordability and how you're productizing deals within the platform and the product. And I guess maybe beyond that big picture, could you talk a little bit about your view of the consumer and the range of outcomes you're contemplating for this year?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nYes. Thanks. So on affordability, we obsess over it, and that's why you are seeing results like our savings increasing 20% year-over-year to $4.75 on items per order. And that's a metric we track really carefully because we want to make sure that when customers come to the platform, we give them a variety of ways to get a deal.\r\nAnd so when you're talking about productizing deals, there's actually a variety of deals, and it's a lot of different products that you have to build to do that. One is loyalty programs. A lot of retailers offer a lot of deals to their loyalty programs. And quarter after quarter, we integrate with the loyalty programs of more and more retailers, which allows us to surface more deals.\r\nWe have retailer-funded deals where they are going to offer, for example, $10 off a particular order to attract customers to them. So that's also a platform that we've built recently and allows retailers to actually put their own funds to attract delivery customers.\r\nWe are also digitizing the weekly flyer. If you look off-line, a lot of people end up looking at the weekly flyer in a paper form before they go to the store to kind of figure out what are the deals that they want to not forget when they get to the store. We're digitizing that so that people benefit from that experience.\r\nAnd then finally, we also have CPGs that are coming in and funding specific deals on their specific product. And we have a format called Stock Up and Save, which is actually an ad format, where CPGs can come and like basically give a deal for people to buy more of that particular product and get a discount for higher quantities.\r\nWe also look at savings in terms of delivery options and providing more affordable delivery options like pickup and No Rush. So that's the people who value price of our convenience can have the great benefit of our service as well. And so all of these adds up to really making it feel like the service quarter after quarter becomes more affordable, and that is reflected in the fact that if you look at our demographics, a couple of years ago, it was -- we were very highly concentrated in terms of affluent demographic. Whereas right now, we actually map to U.S. population pretty closely. And that's something we're very proud about because that means that we align with the entirety of the TAM.\r\nAnd then finally, you asked me for my view on the consumer. I would say we've seen quite a resilient consumer I would say, on the lower end, we certainly see that people are -- with lower income are trying to stretch their budget, trying to make their dollars go faster, and therefore, they do a lot more planning when they think about grocery shopping. And as a result, we want to make it as easy as possible for them to get the best deals, to be able to shop multiple retailers if they want to combine different deals and really see us as a place that helps them meet their budgets and their family needs in the best possible way and really meeting consumers however they want to shop. So that's been really the focus.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\n\nSteven Bryant Fox\n\nJust one question from me on the Uber relationship. I guess from a financial standpoint, how would you expect it to ramp? And what should we think about in starting to see some financial benefits from it? Would it be mainly focused on seeing better subscriber growth or user growth that translates into your business? My understanding from this morning's call is that Uber would basically be using their own couriers to be able to advertise on their space within your channel. So can you just sort of give us a sense directionally how we should think about this helping your business or earnings over, say, the next 2 to 6 quarters?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nYes, absolutely. We're not going to obviously guide specifically here because we have not even launched the service. But I can tell you, at a high level, we are getting an affiliate fee from Uber on orders that we send to them. The deal is positive unit economics day 1 for us, which we're excited about, but we're also going to be investing on top of that to ensure success of the service and adoption.\r\nBut we're not really looking at the restaurant business specifically. What we're really looking at is how this deal can help our business overall by making Instacart an even more engaging app, a more frequent use case by getting us more Instacart+ subscribers. And so we're going to really be looking at all of these metrics and in fact, driving adoption in a way that actually strengthens the entire business, not just get us a restaurant business but really get us a more engaged customer across all of our services. So that's what we're excited about, and we'll -- in terms of ramp-up, we'll have to launch to see that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rob Sanderson with Loop Capital Markets.\n\nRobert Jason Sanderson\n\nMany of my near-term questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to ask about smart cards. What are grocers looking for in terms of proof points to expand deployments? Like are they looking at an ROI calculation? Or are these just more experimental proof-of-concept stages at this point?\r\nAnd what would be a reasonable expectation for when we could think about deployment to maybe 5% of stores? Is that something that could happen like in a 3-year time frame? Is that realistic? And does the hardware costs have to come down meaningfully to think about things like 5% penetration?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nThanks, Rob, for the questions. So in terms of what grocers are looking at, it's exactly the same as the things we've been obsessing over, which is do consumers love the product. And is that changing their behavior. And the answer so far, based on what we've seen, is a resounding yes. We have seen consumers absolutely love using the carts. We hear a lot of anecdotes saying that consumers are like seeking the stores that have carts deployed. We've certainly seen that in Schnucks.\r\nSchnucks also gave us a data point that I put in the letter saying that people who use the cart end up having larger baskets than other carts, and that is a very big driver, as you can imagine, of grocers wanting to adopt that because that allows them to have a higher basket size, have consumers that can skip checkout and have an experience that is a lot more engaging and can create competitive differentiation for them. So we've been really obsessed over the consumer reaction, very encouraged by it, and that's why you're seeing us really pour more fuel on Caper and seeing retailers very excited to deploy that.\r\nIn terms of ramp-up, I would say we -- as you've seen in the letter, we are in many pilots with the largest grocers, whether it's Kroger, Wakefern, Sobeys, Schnucks, the list goes on. And so we expect to have thousands of carts deployed by the end of the year.\r\nAnd then I think it really depends on kind of how those deployments go, but it could scale to many more. We are not guiding to a specific time line because there are a lot of unknowns. But we think that we have everything that we need to be able to scale these carts. \r\nIn terms of cost, we will work to get the hardware cost down in the future, no doubt. But that's not really the main blocker to deployment. I would say that a big part of the business model for Caper is going to come from advertising. And that's another reason why we tell we're really excited about Caper Carts because it becomes a completely new incremental line of business for them of having advertising inside the store on the screen of Caper Carts and a source of revenue for us that can justify putting more of the cost out there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Compton with Macquarie.\n\nRoss Albert Compton\n\nFidji, in your S-1, you estimate that the enterprise segment drove an estimated 20% of company GTV in 2022. And I think what's really interesting is your model, given the economics are similar on marketplace enterprise, you're agnostic to where the demand comes from. I was wondering if you would share how enterprise is evolving where there's more grocers kind of into the online space and are required to adopt your technological tools to kind of compete against Whole Foods and others. Do you see this kind of rising tide lift all boats and even though an order might not occur on marketplace, you kind of win economics on the enterprise tools?\n\nFidji Simo\n\nSo great question. You're right. We remain agnostic between marketplace and white label. And that actually makes us a really strategic partner for grocers because, as you can imagine, in the case of grocers, they would prefer an order to go through their owned and operated platform. And so the fact that we have a partner at the table that wants to grow their O&O as much as we want to grow our marketplace is a very strong competitive advantage for us. We have seen growth of white label to be roughly in line with marketplace. That's remained consistent for a few years.\r\nWhat we are seeing, and I mentioned in the letter, is a deepening of our enterprise relationship with grocers, where, in the past, it might have been just powering the storefront or just powering their fulfillment. And now we are actually powering more and more things for them, whether it's FoodStorm where we power their catering business, whether it's Caper Carts, where we now enter the store, and what they really value is that all of these products are completely integrated.\r\nAnd so if you look at the deal we just announced with Save Mart, where we're really going to power everything for them from their storefront solution to Caper Carts to FoodStorm to Carrot Ads. It's a great example of our enterprise strategy really winning the day because you now can surface ads, again, not just on our marketplace but surface ads on storefront [tools], surface ads on Caper Carts. If [someone is] using our Caper Carts, you can get people to reorder their in-store basket online. So the fact that we power both Caper Carts and their storefront is incredibly helpful.\r\nYou can order catering from the Caper Carts. So again, the fact that we have FoodStorm catering, integrated with Caper Carts is another integration that they love. So when they come to us, it's not for point solutions. It's now for a completely integrated product suite that they get to benefit from end to end instead of having to integrate with 10 different vendors maybe -- may have these [joint cheap] solutions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nSteven Edward McDermott\n\nThis is Steven McDermott on for Justin Post. In your shareholder letter, you touched about driving supply through increasing the delivery areas of customers. I was just wondering if you could flesh out some of those efficiency improvements that allowed that and kind of how the evolution of supply growth looks like going forward kind of given the higher penetration among customers -- or among grocers.\n\nFidji Simo\n\nYes. Thank you. We've always had very strong supply, and we continue to have waitlist for shoppers in many cities and very high satisfaction of shoppers with 80% of shoppers saying that they would recommend this work to someone else and 80% of them saying that Instacart offers well-paid opportunities. So the fact that we have such attractiveness for shoppers is certainly helping us.\r\nThen in addition to that, what we are doing is better matching the shopper supply we do have with the demand that comes onto the platform. And a good example of that is the expansion of the delivery radius that we did in Q1, where we allowed 80% of customers to have access to at least one new retailer by expanding these delivery ranges because we have shoppers that are okay and excited to drive longer distances.\r\nWhat you're seeing also is that we are continuing to drive shopper efficiencies via batching and time-to-deliver orders and that's what has helped transaction revenue and allowed us to reinvest in the business. And we are doing that while also increasing shopper earnings. And so that's really what we continue to obsess over. It's becoming a lot more efficient, which allows us to reinvest in the business. But also giving shoppers more earning opportunities, and the fact that we've been able to drive both of these outcomes is really exciting.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz with The Benchmark Company.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nThis is [Alex] on for Mark. Regarding opportunities to reaccelerate advertising growth from a high level, how would you characterize the relative reliance on net new active brand additions versus improving same client spend? I'm just curious how this dynamic has trended year-to-date.\n\nFidji Simo\n\nThat's a great question. The thing I can tell you is we have thousands of brands that are growing well into the double digits. But we also have a few large brands that have pulled back spend for reasons that are very specific to their own business, and these few brands can have too meaningful of an impact on our overall growth rate.\r\nTo give you an example, we see certain large alcohol brands that have pulled back spend because of everything that's happening in the alcohol category. And because we are still concentrated in the large brands, we are seeing this impact kind of outsized on our platform. And so it's a really big priority for me to continue diversifying the ad business so that we can see less impact when some large brands face challenges in their own business.\r\nI do think that a lot of it is going to come from adding new brands to the platform. But I also think that we have many brands, both large and small, that are still under indexed in terms of ad spend on the platform compared to the performance we drive. And that's why I've been so focused on measurement and improving the performance because we need to be able to go to these brands with absolutely clear data that if they invest more, we will drive more sales. And now that we have all of these proof points, this is going to be a very big focus of the year of continuing to convince existing brands that are not advertising enough as well as new brands to come onto the platform, so very big priority.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham.\n\nStefanos Chambous Crist\n\nThis is Stefanos Crist calling in for Bernie. Emily, congratulations on the new role. Would love to just hear some of your goals and plans maybe in the short and long term, anything different you'd like to do.\n\nEmily Reuter\n\nThanks, Bernie (sic) [Stefanos], and thanks for the congratulations. So I don't really think about it as doing things differently. I think like Nick, focused on creating the most valuable company and generating long-term free cash flow per share. So that's really translated into me focused on finding attractive opportunities for investment and growth. That's also creating a strong portfolio of offerings that serve a broad swath of consumers and meeting them where they are in terms of their consumer journey but also focused on driving operating leverage and delivering improving profitability over time. I think, lastly, I'll comment on we've executed a pretty large share repurchase program, which I've helped execute over the last few months, and we've driven $750 million of share repurchase by the end of Q1.\r\nI think the other thing I'll focus on is just how I'm able to do that. I think if you look at my background, I'm able to leverage 10-plus years of operating experience in a market where obsessing over deepening our leadership position was critical. I've seen very highly competitive markets. I've seen what it looks like to deepen those competitive positions, and I've also seen what it looks like to lose ground. So I'm very focused on that, particularly as Instacart has an incredible lead, and I want to make sure we remain positioned to deepen that lead. So I'm partnering closely with Fidji and the team to ensure that happens, doing all that obviously, investing in those right opportunities while continuing to drive profitability.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

        "title": "Dow's 40,000 on the Way: 3 Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "After witnessing a noteworthy December, the Dow continued its advances this year. The 30-stock blue-chip index closed higher in the last six trading sessions, its longest winning streak since the period ending on Dec 19, when the index notched an astounding nine-day winning streak. The Dow is currently trading above the 39,000 threshold, with market participants eagerly waiting for the index to surpass the 40,000-point mark.\n\nHowever, the blue-chip index time and again found it problematic to cross a multi-zero barrier. Eclipsing the 40,000 barrier remained an uphill task due to the pandemic, elevated interest rates and relentless volatility among high-flying tech stocks. But fortunately, things are looking up at the moment. A “Goldilocks” economic circumstance is expected to take the heat off price pressures and compel the Federal Reserve to ease its monetary policy this year.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 175,000 new jobs in April, the smallest increase in hiring since September, and way less than analysts’ prediction of 240,000 new job additions. At the same time, the jobless rate ticked up to 3.9% from 3.8% and is now tantalizingly close to the 4% mark. In contrast, the uptick in wages over the past 12 months slowed to 3.9% in April from 4.1% in the prior month, the lowest level in three years.\n\nWith fewer jobs and a decline in pay, consumers’ tendency to spend will decline and eventually curb inflationary pressure. This, in turn, will compel the Fed to cut interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, by the way, has ruled out any interest rate hike in its upcoming policy meetings. Needless to say, interest rate cuts boost consumer outlays, and curtail borrowing costs, leading to economic growth and helping the stock market scale northward. Hence, the odds of the Dow blowing past the 40,000 mark seem just a matter of time.\n\nAmid such optimism, it’s judicious for astute investors to invest in fundamentally solid blue-chip stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Salesforce, Inc. CRM that are well-poised to take advantage of the Dow’s uptrend. Being blue-chip stocks, they have sturdy balance sheets, steady cash inflows and large market capitalization. They currently have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 11.8% over the past 60 days. AMZN’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 56.6%. Its projected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 29.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs is a leading global financial holding company.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 9.8% over the past 60 days. GS’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 57.8%.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nA fresh Big Tech boomlet has arrived.\n\nShareholders aren't just seeing their stock prices swell, they are getting paid too. The dividend, its importance demoted over the past couple of decades by the tech boom, is having a moment again thanks in part to the same companies that made it passé.\n\nIn February, META (META) initiated a dividend, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed in April. And then came an increase from Apple (AAPL) last week.\n\nBut why are tech companies initiating payouts, and why now?\n\nThe dividend trend reflects the double role that tech giants hold in society and on Wall Street. They want to be perceived as growth engines, obsessed with frontier tech and fixated on reshaping the future. But they are also mature, cash-rich companies with market caps that start with a \"T.\"\n\nThe former fledglings are now apex predators, seasoned with decades of experience balancing new investments with their core business, which happens to be expanding to virtually every domain of life.\n\nStartup versions of these companies would scoff at the idea of paying back a dividend. It suggests their growth days are behind them, that executives don't have a vision for how to deploy their resources. But in this post-pandemic, pre-AI moment, Big Tech wants to prove they can do two things at once: build the infrastructure to dominate the coming era and show investors they have the fiscal discipline and confidence to return value consistently.\n\nThat the recent wave of dividend announcements has come alongside disclosures of ballooning AI spending reinforces the dual message.\n\nBut it also reflects a reenergized corporate America that has shaken off fears of the recession that never was. Earnings are rising and with it are massive stock buybacks. The recent wave of repurchases, including Apple's record-breaking $110 billion plan, is the largest sum of buybacks since 2018.\n\n\"These companies have seen record profits for some time now and are finding value in passing that profit to shareholders rather than capex,\" said Alex McGrath, chief investment officer at NorthEnd Private Wealth. \"Not to say they are not still heavily investing in growth, but the cash flow has now reached a point where this begins to make sense.\"\n\nShareholder payouts, even modest ones from the tech companies, also grant them entry into funds that require a dividend. They are broadening their pool of investors, drawing from portfolios that seek steady income from dividends and people who simply want to see the \"number go up\" on their brokerage accounts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was the staggering gains of internet companies that played a part in making the dividend seem stodgy and antiquated. Top members of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\" come from the consumer staples and industrials sectors. When you typically think of dividends, you're disconnected from ideas of rapid growth, more risk, and big gains.\n\nBut the mega tech companies have changed. And so has what a dividend company looks like. Just look at Mark Zuckerberg's glow up.\n\n\"If they keep the money internally, there is a tendency to have waste. By paying it out, it instills discipline,\" said Jennifer Koski, professor of finance at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington, who has been teaching dividend cases for the Big Tech companies since before Microsoft (MSFT) initiated its own in 2003. \"The AI spending is their signal we still do have growth opportunities.\"\n\nIn a sign of where things are headed, Koski is planning to teach her next payout policy case. This time, on Amazon (AMZN).\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter @hshaban. morning brief image\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Net Sales Growth: Increased by 22% year-over-year. E-commerce Sales Growth: Grew 33% year-over-year; Amazon sales up 48%, DTC platform up 25%. Wholesale Net Sales Growth: Increased by 10% year-over-year. Gross Margin: Reached 40% in Q1, a 17 point improvement year-over-year. Net Loss: Reduced to $1.0 million, 75% improvement from the previous year. Cash Position: Ended the quarter with $7.3 million in cash, no debt. Inventory Management: Reduced inventory by $700,000 or 11% from year-end 2023. 2024 Full Year Guidance: Net sales projected at $38 to $42 million; gross margin projected at 30% to 41%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with LSF.\n\nRelease Date: May 08, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nLaird Superfood Inc reported a 22% increase in net sales year-over-year, demonstrating strong growth across both e-commerce and wholesale channels. E-commerce segment grew by 33%, with Amazon sales increasing by 48% due to improved inventory management and marketing effectiveness. Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business grew by 25%, with about half of the DTC business now consisting of subscription sales, enhancing customer retention. Wholesale net sales increased by 10% year-over-year without a price increase, indicating efficient cost management and strong market demand. Gross margin improved to 40% in Q1, a significant increase from the previous year, driven by strategic supply chain improvements and cost management.\n\nNegative Points\n\nDespite overall growth, the net loss for Q1 was $1.0 million, although it was a 75% improvement compared to the prior year. The company experienced a planned write-down in the value of coconut milk powder, indicating potential issues in inventory valuation adjustments. Marketing expenses, although reduced, still represent a significant cost at over 20% of net sales, indicating ongoing challenges in balancing growth and profitability. The company's reliance on key e-commerce platforms like Amazon could pose risks associated with platform dependency and the need to continuously win the buy box against competitors. While inventory was reduced by $700,000, this reduction needs to be carefully managed to avoid impacting product availability and sales potential.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you expand on what's been driving growth on Amazon, and has inventory fill been a component of that growth? A: (Jason Vieth, President & CEO) Yes, Amazon's growth exceeded our expectations, driven by strong performance across various segments, not just creamers. Key factors included improved inventory management, winning back the buy box, and effective advertising. The team's operational execution on Amazon has been exceptional.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: Regarding the hydration business, which seems to be driven by the greens product, what are your plans to continue its growth? A: (Jason Vieth, President & CEO) The greens and the newly introduced daily reds are central to this growth. We plan to continue marketing these as the cleanest products on the market, which should attract more consumers. Our strategy includes strong marketing efforts and expanding distribution beyond online platforms.\n\nQ: How has the reduction in promotional activities on the DTC platform impacted customer behavior? A: (Jason Vieth, President & CEO) Reducing promotions and focusing on a content-rich strategy has shifted our brand perception and increased subscriber base. About 50% of our DTC sales are now subscriptions, which offer the best value through consistent discounts, aligning with our goal to maintain a premium brand image.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the improvements in returns and discounts and whether these improvements are sustainable? A: (Anya Hamill, Interim CFO) The improvement in returns and discounts is a result of a strategic shift in our promotional strategy, focusing on efficiency and consumer impact. This approach, particularly in our wholesale business, is expected to sustain throughout the year.\n\nQ: What are your expectations for seasonal impacts on revenue throughout the year? A: (Anya Hamill, Interim CFO) Our business experiences seasonality, particularly in Q3 with our pumpkin and peppermint creamers. Additionally, events like Amazon's Prime Day also drive seasonality in sales, which we anticipate will continue to impact our quarterly performance.\n\nQ: With the shift to less promotional activity, have you noticed any changes in customer churn or order frequency? A: (Jason Vieth, President & CEO) Despite less frequent sales, our shift to a content-driven, subscription-focused approach on the DTC platform has not only retained but also deepened customer relationships. This strategy has successfully increased our subscriber base without significant churn or reduced order frequency.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Depop website screenshotPhotograph: Depop\n\nConsumers have been encouraged to be vigilant when shopping online after research showed fraud was rife on secondhand marketplaces, with Depop, Shpock and Preloved named the worst sites, and problems also discovered with industry giants Amazon and eBay.\n\nA survey of 1,300 buyers by Which?, the consumer champion, found that 32% had been scammed on a secondhand marketplace in the two years to January. The most common ruse involved consumers receiving incorrect goods or nothing at all, while others were delivered an empty package or counterfeit goods.\n\nThe survey comes as an international investigation by the Guardian, Die Zeit and Le Monde shines a light on the scale of authorised push payment (APP) fraud, where victims are duped into making online transfers to a fraudster. It revealed how a vastweb of fake shops touting designer brands took money and personal details from consumers who received no items.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPurchase scams are the most common form of APP fraud. In the first six months of 2023 alone there were 77,000 cases, equivalent to 66% of the total, reported to banks with £41m lost, according to UK Finance figures.\n\nBuyers were most likely to be scammed on Depop, the study found, with 57% telling Which? they had experienced a scam on the site. This compares with 53% for Shpock and 51% for Preloved and Nextdoor. The figure for Amazon Marketplace was 35%, while for Gumtree and eBay it was 29%. The number for Facebook and Vinted was 24% and 22%, respectively.\n\nRocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said that, while buying secondhand can save money, the survey’s findings were “worrying”. “It’s important that people properly check the seller’s reviews and profile,” she said, adding that marketplaces need to have proper checks in place and ensure that scam profiles are removed quickly.\n\nHowever, fraud is not a one-sided affair. Which? questioned 1,400 sellers and 22% of them reported being scammed over the same two-year period. They were most likely to encounter potential fraudsters on Nextdoor, at 39%, followed by 26% for Preloved and Shpock, and Depop on 23%. The figure sat at about 20% for Amazon Marketplace, Facebook and eBay, while on Gumtree and Vinted it was 16% and 11%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response to the report, Depop said it offered protection for buyers and sellers and was investing in new technology. “We strongly encourage consumers who are buying and selling anywhere online never to share personal information with other users, to be very wary about following links to other sites, and to report any suspicious behaviour via in-app reporting systems.”\n\nVinted said that, as customer-to-customer online platforms become more popular, the “risk of these platforms being targeted by scammers also increases”. Its security measures are regularly checked and improved upon and new tools for secure transactions on the platform are always in development, it said.\n\nNextdoor said that it took reports of fraudulent and scam behaviour seriously and prided itself on offering a “safe place” for neighbours to buy, sell and give away items in their local community.\n\nHowever, some companies were critical of the research. Amazon described it as “deeply flawed” and said it did not reflect its own data. “We take these issues incredibly seriously. If a product doesn’t arrive or isn’t as advertised we will fully refund the order,” it said.\n\nThe research was “not an accurate reflection of the scale of the issue”, according to eBay, which also said it took scams seriously. “Ebay remains a safe way for people to find anything from pre-loved fashion to unique collectibles,” it said.",

        "title": "Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) AI push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros packing an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit.\n\nBut it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.\n\nBut the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will serve up at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.\n\nThe M4 and AI\n\nApple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.\n\nMillet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nOutside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly.\n\nThe company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths.\n\nStill, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important.\n\nThe company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party.\n\nCEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months, and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.\n\nThat includes buying up smaller AI firms, and, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, holding talks with both OpenAI and Google about potentially using their large language models to power Apple’s AI experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expect Apple’s generative AI offerings to serve as a catalyst in helping to boost iPhone sales at a time when consumers are increasingly holding on to their phones longer and splashy new features differentiating one generation from another are in short supply.\n\nNow Apple just has to deliver.

        "content": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been a whirlwind of innovation and growth across numerous industries. That makes the case for the best data center stocks to buy.\n\nDemand for advanced data center infrastructure has skyrocketed in the last few years. The companies at the forefront of this technological wave are poised to capitalize on the exponential growth in data processing and storage. As AI models become more complex and demand increases exponentially, data centers form the bedrock for power computation and storage needs.\n\nInvestors keen on profiting from the AI craze should be eyeing top data center stocks to add to their portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are the best data center stocks to buy in 2024!\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is a force to be reckoned with in the data center space. Its comprehensive portfolio of servers, storage solutions and networking products provide the foundation for enterprises to build AI-powered infrastructure.\n\nDell’s PowerEdge servers provide robust performance and scalability, making them ideal for handling the most demanding AI workloads. Additionally, the company’s networking solutions ensure seamless data flow with the data center, a critical factor in ensuring AI applications run smoothly and efficiently. Dell’s strategic focus on edge computing is also a strong competitive advantage. Wall Street is particularly bullish after the company posted strong results for FY23. Although top-line growth fell 14% year-over-year (YOY), net earnings grew 32% YOY to $3.2 billion. These recent developments align perfectly with AI, making Dell stock one of the best data center stocks to buy now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a powerhouse in high-performance networking solutions. The company specializes in data center switches and routers, delivering lightning-fast speeds, low latency and unmatched scalability.\n\nArista Networks’ technology and infrastructure are critical to developing and deploying advanced AI applications. The combination of its CloudVision platform and EOS cloud operating system is essential for supporting AI workloads that often involve transferring and processing enormous data sets. AI hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) rely heavily on Arista’s networks for their internal infrastructure. In the 2023 fiscal year, Arista saw record revenue, earnings and FCF from operations. Demand for Arista’s products has remained strong, and its operating margins have expanded significantly over the last decade. With AI workloads becoming increasingly more complicated in presenting the case for network conjunction, ANET stock is well-positioned to address these bottlenecks.\n\nStory continues\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) might not be a household name like the others, but it plays a pivotal role in the data center world. The company provides software tools used in the design of chips found in data center servers, networking equipment and other essential hardware.\n\nThe rise of AI has created a strong tailwind for Synopsys. More sophisticated AI chips are crucial to meet the growing demands of AI workloads. Synopsys’ tools hold a key to innovation in performance and power efficiency. By working directly with chip designers, Synopsys can help unlock the full potential for enhanced computing power. In the 2023 fiscal year, Synopsys saw record revenue of $5.84 billion, up 15% YOY. EPS increased 26% YOY to $7.92 per share while delivering strong cash flow from operations. Growth also doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon, with revenue up 25% in Q1 FY24 and EPS coming in at the high end of guidance. As leading semiconductors continue to rely on their robust semiconductor IP portfolio, Synopsys is one of the top data center stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "After people buy the essentials, some of their money goes toward discretionary spending. These extra purchases fuel the economy and create many jobs, but the best consumer stocks to buy can also lead to long-term wealth.\n\nBusinesses have been jostling for market share and trying to attract higher percentages of consumer spending. Some corporations have established themselves as industry leaders and regularly generate additional revenue and profits.\n\nSome consumer stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years. These are some of the picks investors may want to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) combines low prices with an array of products. The retailer is the world’s leading grocer, which makes it resilient to economic downturns. The company’s affordability can make it more attractive to consumers as the costs of goods and services continue to rise.\n\nThe company reported 5.7% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24. Advertising and e-commerce exhibited impressive growth rates, and recent investments suggest Walmart is emphasizing these segments. The recent acquisition of Vizio Holdings demonstrates Walmart’s desire to expand in advertising. Ads have higher profit margins than retail sales but currently make up a sliver of Walmart’s total sales.\n\nWalmart is up by 13% year-to-date and has gained 76% over the past five years. It has a 31 P/E ratio and offers a 1.39% yield. Analysts have rated the stock a “Strong Buy” and believe it can gain an additional 10% from current levels.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has pricing power due to its focus on healthy food and ingredients. While most fast-food restaurant giants are losing consumers, Chipotle didn’t have that issue in the first quarter of 2024. During that quarter, revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year, while diluted EPS jumped by 23.9% year-over-year.\n\nChipotle opened 47 new restaurants in the quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024. The fast food restaurant chain included a Chipotlane in 43 of the 47 new restaurants. Chipotlanes has been effective at generating digital sales and increasing restaurant efficiency.\n\nShares are up by 43% year-to-date and have soared by 353% over the past five years. Chipotle recently announced a 50-for-1 stock split that will make shares more affordable. The bid can increase employee retention, and it should also stimulate options trading activity. Options traders don’t have a way to trade fractional contracts, so reducing the share price will make options contracts more affordable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s most recognizable online marketplace. The company continues to post record sales and delivers impressive results for its investors.\n\nThe tech conglomerate reported 13% year-over-year net sales growth in Q1 2024. The online marketplace was a decisive component of the company’s $143.3 billion quarter. However, that wasn’t the only proponent that drove the stock higher. Amazon Web Services revenue reached $25.0 billion, which was 17% higher than in the same period last year. Advertising, grocery sales, subscriptions and artificial intelligence also contributed to the company’s net sales.\n\nNet income more than tripled year-over-year to reach $10.4 billion. With other tech giants offering dividends, it may only be a matter of time before Amazon offers a dividend for its investors. However, analysts aren’t waiting for the corporation to issue a dividend to get on board the rally train. The average price target suggests a 16% gain from current levels. Amazon is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "Companies have generally managed to perform well against the consensus of earnings forecasts, with around 77% of S&P 500 firms reporting in Q1 considered earnings outperformers. That rate is higher than the normal rate of around 74% recorded in the first three months of a year, with earnings outperformers beating historical trends.\n\nThe main theme of this quarter’s earnings reports has been artificial intelligence, with companies reporting soaring spending on the technology. Not surprisingly, AI-based and adjacent stocks have been the star earnings outperformers.\r\n\r\nWith about 80% of the major names having reported so far, some big companies that are still likely to move the market have yet to update investors on their Q1 financials. Even though the number of firms reporting earnings is declining as the season comes to an unofficial end, there are still some potential earnings outperformers left to deliver strong results despite an already solid market.\n\nNVDIA (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith AI taking center stage during this earnings season, the top performer in the space has yet to report. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a consistent AI earnings outperformer, is set to report its earnings on May 22 amid high expectations about whether its meteoric rise continues and what guidance it will provide.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOther AI companies have provided positive commentary, with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) significantly increasing its orders of Nvidia’s H100 chips that power AI workloads. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also looking to nearly double its use of H100 chips in 2024 as it works to roll out full self-driving cars.\r\n\r\nAnalyst consensus forecasts Nvidia’s revenue growth will slow down from last year’s explosive pace but remain celestial, with EPS projected to rise 34% to $7.64.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has a proven track record of handily beating estimates since the AI boom, followed by a rally in its share price. Will the company deliver over $0.50 in earnings upside for the fourth consecutive quarter and turn Nvidia into another earnings outperformer?​\n\nApogee Therapeutics (APGE) pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factory\n\nSource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelatively small pharmaceutical company Apogee Therapeutics (NASDAQ:APGE) saw its stock jump over 95% after it was one of the earnings outperformers in its most recent release. Its earnings came with positive data on the progress of one of its two investigational candidates for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Atopic Dermatitis.\n\nThe AD candidate completed positive Phase 1 trials just before the earnings report. The company took advantage of the post-earnings stock surge to sell $420 million worth of shares, though the stock price has retreated slightly since.\r\n\r\nWhile the company hasn’t scheduled its next earnings date yet, it historically reports in early June. Investors will then get more details of the company’s financials and pipeline, including an increased cash position of approximately double its $399.5 million cash on hand last time it reported following the share issuance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis provides a fairly comfortable runway to complete ongoing clinical trials as the company works to establish itself as a potential earnings outperformer in the biopharma industry.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs investors worried about China’s economic recovery earlier this year, Chinese tech firm JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and other Chinese stocks saw their share price plummet.\n\nHowever, China’s Q1 GDP growth exceeded expectations, and Chinese tech stocks have rebounded, with some still making a recovery. JD.com currently trades at a relatively low price-to-earnings P/E ratio of 15.15, showing a notable gap from its American equivalent, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a P/E ratio of 52.\r\n\r\nJD.com is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on May 16. Analysts estimate forecast earnings of $0.65 per share, slightly below the $0.66 reported in the previous year.\n\nHowever, JD.com has a solid track record of beating analyst estimates and being an earnings outperformer. Given it topped analysts’ EPS estimate of $4.51 per share by 17% at $5.30 in March for the fiscal year 2023, recording a straight 10-year beat, and an attractive valuation, JD.com remains well-positioned as an earnings outperformer for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best gig economy stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the gig economy market, go directly to the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy.\n\nGig Economy: An Introduction\n\nThe gig economy refers to a labor market characterized by short-term, freelance, or independent contractor positions, where individuals are hired on a temporary or flexible basis to complete specific tasks or projects. Gig workers are independent contractors who typically find work through online platforms or apps that connect them with clients or customers who are looking for various kinds of services such as coding, writing, and graphic designing, among others.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main growth catalysts for gig workers and the number of these independent contractors is rising rapidly. According to a report by MBO Partners, 45% of the US American workforce worked as independent contractors in 2023. Between 2020 and 2023, the number of independent workers grew by 89%. The report states that 40% of the gig workers said that they used online platforms to find work over the last 12 months and 47% are planning to use them over the next 12 months.\n\nGig Work Statistics\n\nAccording to Business Research Insights, the global gig economy market was valued at $14.75 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% between 2023 and 2031, reaching $92.9 billion at the end of the forecasted period. A report by the gig economy company, Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK), posted in October 2023, revealed that Gen Z and millennials are the top earners in the gig economy with 45% of the former and 44% of the latter group making at least $2,500 a month from the platform. Moreover, as of 2022, North American and Western European citizens have the highest average freelance rates at $44 and $31 per hour, respectively. It is followed by South America at $24 per hour and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe are all tied at $22 per hour.\n\nGig Economy Stocks to Thrive Amidst Secular Shift\n\nOn February 16, MoffettNathanson’s senior research analyst, Michael Morton told CNBC that the last 12 months have been quite positive for the gig economy stocks. He said that initially, the industry was considered a weak domain by investors because it consumed $125 billion of investor capital between 2015 and 2022 while being focused on expanding market share rather than increasing profitability. However, over the last year, companies like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) have experienced a “profitability explosion” due to their corporate decisions. Morton added that according to his firm, the total addressable market for the gig economy industry is around $4 trillion. He noted that grocery delivery is a trillion-dollar market that is “underpenetrated”, and there is a chance that Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) could also capture a noteworthy share of this market very soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicheal Morton mentioned that he has heard people refer to Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) as “undeletable apps” and noted several growth prospects for these companies. They are some of the biggest gig economy companies in the world. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted its FY23 earnings on February 7, reporting that its gross bookings were up 19% year-over-over, and it generated a revenue of $37.28 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The company reported a net income of $1.887 billion, compared to a net loss of $9.14 billion in FY22.\n\nWhile Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) seems to have a promising future, it faced several headwinds in the first quarter of 2024 due to which its earnings and revenues declined slightly. It reported its Q1 earnings on May 8 with a loss per share of $0.32. Nevertheless, the company’s revenue was up 15%  year-over-year at $10.1 billion, and income from operations was $172 million, up $434 million from Q1 2023. The company reached an adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% year-over-year, marking a new quarterly record for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). The company also generated a free cash flow of $4.2 billion over the trailing twelve months. The company’s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, made the following remarks:\n\n“Q1 marked another strong quarter for Uber. Gross Bookings growth remained consistent at 21% YoY on a constant-currency basis (22% excluding Freight), as we generated Gross Bookings of $37.7 billion. We landed just shy of our guidance midpoint, with softer Mobility activity in LatAm as we lapped heightened demand during Carnival last year, coupled with the impact of holidays shifting into Q1 of this year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of roughly $205 million YoY or roughly 70 bps. We grew our revenue by 15% YoY on a constant-currency basis to $10.1 billion, which includes a 8 percentage point YoY headwind related to business model changes. As a reminder, certain business model changes, which have no impact on profitability, negatively impacted revenue reporting by $742 million. We expect to lap the majority of these business model changes in the second half of this year.\n\nWe converted this strong top-line growth into solid profitability, with all-time high Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, up 82% YoY, and a record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.7% of Gross Bookings, an increase of 130 bps YoY. We intentionally held back some of our in-market Mobility investments with lower ROI as Q1 is typically a lighter quarter due to seasonal Mobility rider behaviors. We remain focused on striking the right balance between growth and profitability, and running Uber to deliver on the 3-year financial framework we set in February.”\n\nOn February 15, DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) reported a net loss attributed to the company and shareholders of $558 million for FY23, compared to a net loss of $1.365 billion in FY22. The company generated a revenue of $8.6 billion in 2023, compared to $6.58 billion in 2022. It announced its first quarter 2024 earnings on May 1, reporting an EPS of -$0.06. The company’s GAAP net loss including redeemable non-controlling interests was $25 million, down from $162 million in Q1 2023. The revenue for the quarter was $2.51 billion, up 23% year-over-year, which outperformed the analyst estimates by $60 million. At DoorDash, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:DASH) Q1 earnings call, the CEO Ravi Inukonda said:\n\n“...consumer engagement and spending on the platform continues to be very strong. You can see that in our strong Q1 results, as well as the double-digit growth rate that we have driven consistently for the last two years in a row. I am not going to comment on the month-to-month, but it continues -- order frequency continues to be very good.\n\nIn fact, it's an all-time high. Retention continues to be very strong in the business, retention this past quarter is higher than the prior quarter. We feel very confident about the input metrics we are seeing and I feel very good about the guidance for Q2.”\n\nAs mentioned by Michael Morton, the gig economy industry is expected to grow significantly in the future with a $4 trillion total addressable market, and companies are rushing to capture a major chunk of it. Some of the best gig economy stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER).

IAC Inc. (NASDAQ:IAC) is engaged in the media and Internet business. Its two core business segments are Dotdash Meredith and ANGI Homeservices. Dotdash Meredith provides digital and print publishing services. ANGI Homeservices offers a gateway to repair, remodeling, cleaning, and other services. While Dotdash Meredith results were in line, ANGI fell short of expectations as they are shifting their focus to high-quality customers to generate more profitability. Shares of IAC fell -20% on this report and we added to the position on weakness.”\n\n8. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 46\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“A higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”\n\n7. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nAirbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) offers a marketplace for homeowners to rent out their property for a short term. 50 hedge funds had investments in Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) with positions worth $1.6 billion.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) to Buy from Neutral and increased the price target to$200 from $150.\n\nPolen Capital stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we initiated new positions in Sage Group and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and added to our existing position in Globant.\n\nAirbnb is a great business model, according to our research, due to its two-sided global network effects. For several reasons, Airbnb has a better mousetrap with its supply growth engine, with its hosts having a far lower cost of capital and more flexibility than hotels. We think private rentals should continue to grow their share of overall accommodation stays, potentially up to 30% of lodging or higher over the long term, letting the private rental gross booking value grow at a low double-digit rate. We also think Airbnb should continue to gain share within the private rental market as its global network effects strengthen, allowing for mid-teens revenue growth. With flat to rising margins over time, significant free cash flow generation, and a management team that has demonstrated its owner orientation, this should result in high-teens EPS growth over time. While the path there will not be linear, and it is a more discretionary spending-tied business, we think the long-term secular growth opportunity is very compelling.”\n\n6. DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nDoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) is one of the most popular food delivery services in the U.S. and contributes to the gig economy as it connects restaurants to customers through its network of delivery drivers. According to our database, 64 hedge funds had stakes in the stock in the fourth quarter of 2023, with positions worth $3 billion. With 5.51 million shares of the company, valued at $545.22 million, Himension Capital is the most significant shareholder of the company, as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) has a consensus Buy rating among 19 analysts, and its average price target of $136.75 represents an upside of 16.29% from the last price of $117.59, as of May 6.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) are some of the best gig economy stocks to buy, along with DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH).\n\nRiverPark Advisors stated the following regarding DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we initiated new GardenSM positions in DoorDash, Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH), GoDaddy and Vertiv. DoorDash is a technology-driven marketplace that enables couriers (Dashers) to deliver restaurant and other local orders on-demand to consumers. The company is a market leader in restaurant delivery, a business that continues to gain US market share (with healthy margins) and grow internationally. At the same time, heavy investment in newer businesses has limited company profitability. Most notably, grocery delivery is a largely untapped market due to inventory management challenges (in-person grocery shopping involves a high degree of product substitution). This business unit has been losing money. However, the company believes it has a competitive cost advantage given its existing Dasher network, and continued growth will lead to profitability—something it is not getting credit for by the market. The future near-term profit trajectory from new businesses is unclear, but we view management as very rational with its spending. Either these initiatives will yield additional profitable revenue streams, or they will be deprioritized in the coming years—in both scenarios, we expect solid profit growth over time.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States with the Lowest Homeless Populations Per Capita in the US 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts 20 Best Business Ideas According To Reddit\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Ad Sector Superstars: 3 Stocks Poised to Thrive on Robust Marketing Trends",
        "content": "Forecasts for the U.S. ad market continue to become more optimistic, pushing advertising stocks to buy to new heights. What’s more, the sector is expected to expand tremendously in 2024. For example, research firm IPG Mediabrands last month raised its forecast for the U.S. ad market’s growth to 9.2% from its previous 8.4% estimate. In the second half of the year, many websites’ revenue will get boosts from political ads. In fact, IPG expects digital spending by political entities to jump 156% this year, compared with 2020. Other macro factors pushing ad spending are easing inflation and significant GDP growth. Hot sectors such as travel, retailers and food and beverage are spending the most on ads. Meanwhile, Forrester expects the U.S. ad market to increase by a healthy 6.6% this year. For those who want to exploit the growth of the U.S. ad market, here are three top advertising stocks to buy.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest, Inc. (PINS) logo\n\nSource: tanuha2001 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) features recipes, along with information about home goods and style ideas.\n\nThe company recently reported stellar first-quarter results, showing that it’s benefiting a great deal both from the strong U.S. macro ad environment and its ad partnerships. Specifically, the company’s revenue jumped 23% versus the same period a year earlier to $740 million, while its EBITDA soared an incredible 319% year-over-year to $113 million. Pinterest’s global monthly active user base climbed 23% YOY to $740 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the company’s Q1 earnings call, CEO William Ready noted that the firm’s partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had been active since February. Meanwhile, its alliance with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) was in its initial stages but progressing well. He added that the firm’s partnerships in general had made a significant revenue contribution.\n\nThe CEO added that the firm is benefiting from increased engagement in general and strong interest in the platform from members of Generation Z in particular.\n\nGoing forward, I expect the company’s strong popularity and impressive partnerships to enable it to continue to deliver impressive financial results.\n\nAll of these positive catalysts make Pinterest one of the top advertising stocks to buy.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother clear beneficiary of the strong U.S. ad market, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), grew very rapidly in Q1 and generated significant, positive, adjusted EBITDA for a third straight quarter. Also importantly, its cash flow from operations is growing very quickly.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, Roku reported that its net revenue had jumped 19% last quarter YOY $881.5 million. Its cash flow from operations had risen to $456 million. Meanwhile, its EBITDA, excluding certain items, rose to $40.9 million, versus an EBITDA loss of $69.1 million in Q1 of 2023. Roku also added 1.6 million households in Q1, while the number of hours streamed on its platform jumped 23% YOY. And very encouragingly, the number of hours streamed on Roku’s Roku Channel soared 66% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier.\n\nSeaport Research upgraded its rating on the shares to “Buy” from “Neutral.” Seaport expects Roku to benefit from the strong digital-ad market and notes that it’s changing hands for only 20 times its free cash flow. The firm placed a $74 price target on the shares.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn recent months, the Street appears to have become much more upbeat on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT). SPOT stock has jumped 34% in the last three months and 107% in the last year.\n\nBritish bank HSBC started coverage of the shares with a “Buy” rating. The bank believes that the firm can exploit its market-leading position in music streaming to generate a meaningful amount of revenue from podcasts and audiobooks. Consequently, HSBC thinks that the firm’s revenue can soar to $170 billion in 2030 from $14.5 billion last year.\n\nAlso upbeat on Spotify is Bank of America which includes the name on its list of top U.S. stocks.\n\nIn Q1, the audio company’s sales jumped 20% YOY while its premium subscriber count climbed 14% YOY. Its operating income came in at a record high of 168 million euros.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

        "title": "ABX pilots win back Amazon business with power of positivity",
        "content": "An ABX Air Boeing 767-200 prepares to depart Charlotte Douglas International Airport on Sept. 23, 2019. ABX Air has about 24 B767s in its fleet, four of which are currently dedicated to Amazon. (Photo: Shutterstock/Jair Mundo)\n\nA new transportation services agreement to operate 10 Boeing 767 cargo jets for Amazon paved the way for pilots at cargo airline ABX Air over the weekend to ratify an extension of their labor contract until 2030, company officials said Tuesday.\n\nAmazon’s assignment of planes to ABX Air was also made possible by union leaders’ more collaborative approach to jointly growing business after a history of tensions and a shortage of captains at sister airline Air Transport International, they said.\n\nParent company Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) on Monday announced it signed a five-year deal with Amazon to operate an additional 10 Boeing 767-300 converted freighters on behalf of its largest customer, which will supply the aircraft. ABX Air will hire more than 50 pilots to support the new contract.\n\nThe pilot contract was negotiated in three days and provides Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) with the long-term labor stability it needs, ATSG Chief Executive Officer Joe Hete said during an earnings call with analysts about the company’s first-quarter results. The agreement came about because the pilots approached the company and offered to extend it beyond the 2026 eligibility date for making amendments.\n\nThe Airline Professionals Association “had a hole to dig out of and finally came to the realization that maybe there’s a better way to approach this than the traditional, let’s- go-after-the-company kind of thing. They came to us with an offer to extend the existing agreement to give potential customers some comfort that they wouldn’t experience any labor disruptions in the future,” he said.\n\nHete was referring to a short strike initiated by the union in 2016 during the first year of operations for Amazon’s private airline and on the eve of the Black Friday shopping period. The strike disrupted fulfillment operations and soured Amazon on giving new business to ABX.\n\nAmazon is expected to provide the first cargo jet in June and the remaining aircraft by year’s end. The agreement includes an option for Amazon to sublease 10 more aircraft to ATSG after 2024.\n\nOnly four of the 40 B767 cargo jets currently flown by ATSG for Amazon are under the ABX brand. Air Transport International operates the other 36 aircraft in Amazon’s domestic parcel network. The new deal will bring to 50 the number of aircraft in ATSG’s Amazon portfolio, including 30 planes owned by ATSG and leased to Amazon as part of a bundled service package.\n\nFreightWaves recently reported on how the Airline Professionals Association has adopted a more conciliatory style to help rebuild trust with management, including acting as an unofficial ATSG marketing arm that promotes high service levels before potential customers.\n\nStory continues\n\n“They’ve also done a fabulous job over the last several years presenting themselves at industry conferences. Normally, you will not see airlines and unions represented at the industry conferences,” said ATSG President Mike Berger. “They’ve done a really nice job of rebranding themselves in a very positive way. And I think this is an example of the fruits of their labor.” The Airline Professionals Association had a booth at the AirCargo 2024 conference in Louisville, Kentucky, Feb. 11-13. ABX Chairman Randy Riesback (left) and Executive Council member Andrew Whobrey(second from right) were part of a team talking to airlines and freight forwarders about ABX Air’s reliability and service. (Photo: Eric Kulisch/FreightWaves)\n\nHete said the combination of a changed union attitude and the better hourly pay scales it could offer because of higher rates in the Amazon contract enabled a collective bargaining agreement and the ability to attract new pilots.\n\n“You have to have realistic expectations on both sides of the table. Obviously, we had to give some stuff up. And obviously they had to pull back from what others think the market is for our type of business,” the CEO said. “We’re not a passenger airline, we’re not a FedEx or UPS. We’re in a different marketplace altogether. And, you know, when people put their minds to it, they can come to an agreement that works for everybody.”\n\nWhile management and the unionized pilots at ABX Air are rowing in the same direction, relations between ATSG and the Air Transport International pilots are frayed. The ATI pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, earlier this year asked the National Mediation Board to disband mediated negotiations so they can eventually call a strike. The sides have been in talks since late 2020. The union has accused the company of stalling serious talks until a contract with Amazon is renewed in 2026, which would better enable executives to know what cost increases they could bear.\n\nThe union says ATI pilots are underpaid and overworked because of unfavorable crew scheduling, which resulted in 250 pilots leaving the airline last year. ATI has about 600 pilots. Union officers have said they want a contract similar to one approved at Hawaiian Airlines last year.\n\nABX pilots enjoy slightly better pay than their ATI counterparts. A 12-year captain makes $288 per hour at ABX and $282 at ATI. Someone with the same experience level at Atlas Air, another Amazon partner, earns $298 an hour, according to figures from ALPA.\n\nATSG and ATI union leaders participated in another mediation session last week. Hete said on Tuesday he doesn’t expect an agreement to be completed this year because the union is being unrealistic.\n\n“I think the fact that we were able to get something across the plate with the ABX guys says the company can get there from here,” he said.\n\nOne reason ABX was a better candidate to take the new Amazon workload is that Air Transport International doesn’t have enough captains. The airline has hired plenty of first officers, but most don’t have enough experience to be captains yet, Hete said. The Air Line Pilots Association blames unsatisfactory working conditions and compensation for the shortfall, saying 250 pilots left the company last year — a 45% attrition rate.\n\nThe high turnover means Air Transport International is hiring pilots without sufficient experience to be in charge of a widebody jet like a 767, leading to a high washout rate during training and a workforce shortage, Mike Sterling, chair of the ATI Master Executive Council, told FreightWaves in February.\n\n“The ABX option with the new agreement certainly made it easier for us to onboard the necessary people in the tight time frame that we have,” Hete explained. “We have to get these aircraft into service by December 1. And that’s a lot of airplanes to bring on when we won’t receive the first one until June.”\n\nABX pilots also offer a cost advantage because all flights begin and end where the crew is permanently based. If pilots want to live elsewhere, they are responsible for getting to work on their own time and expense. Air Transport International pilots live around the country and are provided a company-paid ticket to whatever airport the aircraft is departing from. And the ATI pilots receive premium pay that has negatively impacted earnings in recent quarters, Hete added.\n\nATSG reported adjusted pretax earnings of $15 million in the first quarter, down $23 million from the same period in 2023.\n\nThe company’s stock closed at $14.67 per share on Tuesday, up 12% from Monday’s open.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\n\nABX Air pilots choose cooperation over confrontation\n\nPilots flying Amazon cargo say employer stalling contract talks\n\nInflation tempers Cargojet’s outlook despite Q1 volume growth\n\nThe post ABX pilots win back Amazon business with power of positivity appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $189.94 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 24.2% since the start of the year compared to the 10.1% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 17.6% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 30, 2024, Amazon reported EPS of $1.13 versus consensus estimate of $0.83 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.55%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $4.54 per share on $638.26 billion in revenues. This represents a 56.55% change in EPS on a 11.04% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.77 per share on $709.99 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 27.08% and 11.24%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nAmazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nAmazon has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 41.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 20.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 25X versus its peer group's average of 14.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.4. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Amazon shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\n\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PDD Holdings Inc. (PDD). PDD has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of D.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. PDD Holdings Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 50.94%, and for the current fiscal year, PDD is expected to post earnings of $8.47 per share on revenue of $51.89 billion.\n\nShares of PDD Holdings Inc. have gained 13.7% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 16.26X and a P/CF of 20.57X.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMZN and PDD, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 3 Best Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "A group of large technology companies deemed the \"Magnificent Seven\" has broadly defined investing success over the past decade. If you held any of these stocks, you'd probably be thrilled with your investment returns.\n\nWhile many of the Magnificent Seven stocks are now worth over a trillion dollars and likely won't repeat their same growth over the next 10 years, some can still make you richer over time.\n\nHere are my top three picks of this group to buy and hold indefinitely.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMost everyone knows about e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which dominates online shopping and accounts for 38% of the market in America. Many people may even know that Amazon operates the world's leading cloud platform, AWS, a virtual underpinning of the internet today. Fewer people probably realize that Amazon has become a tremendous advertising company. Its ad business grew 24% year over year in the first quarter and is on pace for $45 billion this year.\n\nNo company in history might be as good as Amazon at finding ways to enter and dominate new markets. How does a company go from selling books online to selling everything to over 200 million Prime subscribers? How does an online bookstore start and beat tech-focused competitors to become the leading cloud platform? Now, investors are beginning to see just how big Amazon's ad business is becoming. It's truly remarkable.\n\nThat's especially so because all of these markets have years of growth ahead. E-commerce is still just 22% of total U.S. retail. Amazon Web Services is still growing well into the double digits; it just rose 17% year over year in Q1, and that's not likely to slow down with artificial intelligence (AI) taking off. Amazon's ad business is now its fastest-growing segment, so it probably still has years of expansion ahead. Buy and hold Amazon. It's boring but consistently delivers.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nEveryone seems to have social media, but Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) continues to grow its user base. Over the past three months, the company racked up another 50 million daily active users across its family of apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. That's now 3.24 billion people logging on each day. Meta makes money (lots of it) by selling digital ads to companies. It's also remarkably lucrative; about $0.35 of every revenue dollar is free cash flow. Meta's trailing-12-month revenue is $142 billion, which shows you how much cash that is.\n\nMeta just started paying a dividend and famously repurchases a ton of stock to help further boost earnings-per-share. That financial engineering alone could make you wealthier over the long term. Investors believe the company's earnings can grow by an average of 19% annually over the next three to five years, so a slowdown doesn't appear in the cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is still just about 40 years old, making him young enough to continue leading the company for decades into the future if he chooses. Zuckerberg has pushed the company to invest billions into AI development, sometimes turning Wall Street off. Still, if these investments prove fruitful, they could cement the growth of the next generation of Meta investors.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), a household name and tech giant, is the oldest of this group by far. The company's roots go back to the modern PC, and it's a testament to the company that its legacy businesses remain influential today. Over the years, management has branched the company into new markets, like cloud computing, gaming, and AI. It's partnered successfully with OpenAI, arguably the most innovative AI developer.\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft's earnings will grow by an average of \"just\" 16% annually over the next three to five years, which is still plenty to do some excellent work for your portfolio. Notably, Microsoft might be the safest stock you can own. It boasts an AAA credit rating, higher than the U.S. government and one of only two public companies with such a strong rating.\n\nMicrosoft is also a well-known dividend growth stock with 22 consecutive increases. The stock's dividend yield is 0.7% today but has grown by an average of 10% annually over the past five years. The payout only takes up 30% of cash flow, so there is plenty of room for future growth. Investors don't have to overthink Microsoft's diverse business. Buy, hold, and reinvest the dividends for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Now I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Steelberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nRyan Steelberg\n\nThank you, Stefan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are excited to speak with you today and provide an update on our first quarter 2024 operations and financial performance. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before sharing the broader company updates and turning it over to Mike Symmetra for more details on our financial performance.\r\n Veritone had a strong start to 2024. We delivered a healthy quarter of new business wins and demonstrated strong momentum against our commitments announced last quarter. We continue to make progress bolstering our fundamentals, rightsizing our operating structure and aligning our investments and technical resources to accelerate our AI software and services revenue growth and technological leadership within the AI industry for the first quarter of 2024.\r\n Veritone delivered total revenue of $31.6 million and non-GAAP operating loss of $7.6 million, outperforming the high end of our guidance. Annual reoccurring revenue was $72.1 million, including $48.6 million from subscription versus consumption-based customers representing an improvement of 7% from Q1 2023 for subscription-based ARR. First quarter operating results underscore the strength of our strategy and execution over the last year, both of which have shifted our focus back to long-term, sustainable and profitable growth.\r\n We are seeing clear signs that the steps taken to align Veritone's go-to-market strategy are gaining traction. Our restructuring efforts continued throughout the first quarter of 2024, and we expect to realize the full benefits of these efforts beginning in the second quarter of 2024. We also expect future cost and revenue related synergies to materialize in the later part of this year.\r\n As discussed on our last earnings call, we are now targeting to achieve profitability on a non-GAAP basis as early as Q4 2024 and for the entirety of 2025. Notably, Veritone achieved several technological milestones in the first quarter and saw increased momentum, evidenced by a robust qualified pipeline of commercial and public sector enterprises. Our aiWARE powered solutions, which provide a best-in-class ecosystem of AI models and intelligent data lake and workflow tools remain the cornerstone of our operations, allowing us to adapt alongside the development of AI, technology and models to meet the unique needs of our customers. Coupled with our progress in LOMs and retrieval augmented generation.\r\n Our comprehensive AI product suite positions us as a complementary solution to hardware providers and hyperscalers in the AI ecosystem generative, AI stands as the preeminent focus of technological innovation with companies of all sectors in the early stages of incorporating next-generation AI capabilities into their existing solutions. Concurrently, cloud providers are launching new services and ramping capacity and semiconductor firms are experiencing the escalating demand for AI and data center chip applications.\r\n According to IDC forecast, total worldwide expenditure on generative AI is projected to grow from $19.4 billion in 2023 to a staggering $151 billion by 2027. The accessibility and ease of use of new AI models has raised the prospect for rapid and widespread adoption. However, barriers still remain census. Bureau's business survey indicates that less than 5% of firms are formerly using generative AI to produce goods and services.\r\n Although the share is two to three times as high among information, professional services and financial firms, the most commonly cited barriers to early AI adoption are short-term factors such as lack of knowledge, privacy concerns and technological maturity. Ameriton was created to break down these barriers with the ultimate mission to democratize AI, advance the capabilities of AI and empower our customers and partners to do even better than before.\r\n Earlier today, we announced a major expansion in our go-to-market and service offerings with the launch of our integrated AI Consulting and Services group through our expanded offering. We hope to address the growing demand for expertise in the deployment of enterprise AI technologies and bridge a gap in the market between AI providers and customers, allowing us to serve as a trusted partner for our customer organizations in their journey to realize the full value of AI Veritone services launched at the advanced tier services partner level within the AWS partner network complements our historical differentiated status on the AWS software partner path with numerous AWS validated offerings in key areas such as machine learning and public safety.\r\n Our elevation to the advanced tier services partner level recognizes the pivotal role. Veritone AI Consulting and Services Group will play in the advancement of AI empowering customers to effectively use and derive the most benefit from the technology. Specifically, our partnership with AWS will further empower Veritone to develop and deploy innovative AI software solutions.\r\n Similar to the media management platform and licensing services, Veritone architecture for U.S. soccer. By combining human expertise with a aiWARE technology, our newly formed group will empower businesses on their digital transformation journey through custom AI strategy development, AI, workflow solutions and innovation workshops through partnering with Veritone's AI Consulting and Services group customers will benefit from an expedited path to AI activation as well as enhanced scalability reliability and performance for their AI driven initiatives. We expect net new bookings and accretive revenue growth at attractive margins starting in 2024 from this new and expanded services offerings Now let me turn to our vertical markets. First, Veritone's higher platform.\r\n Veritone higher continued to perform well, again, capitalizing on its strong commercial strategy and focus on multi-year subscription engagements, helping contribute to a near 10% increase in subscription-based ARR or Veritone in Q1, beginning in the second half of 2024, we expect to see material growth on a global basis from broad being driven by our ability to expand into controlling not just the job distribution software budget, but the advertising budgets as well for Amea clients. We expect to finalize the full integration in the first half of 2024 and begin to realize further synergies from a sales and marketing, organizational integration and technological integrations in the later half of the year.\r\n One notable synergy update. We launched programmatic offering in the UK in Q1, and we're expanding further to big continental European markets, Germany and France and Australia. By the end of the year. Veritone hire recently landed a new RFP wins in Amea with a Fortune 10 clients that will contribute over $2 million in gross media revenues and will facilitate 7,500 hires on an annual basis starting in mid-May 2024. Additional key wins in the quarter include Alfa Laval's, DaVita Davidson, Hospitality Group, uniting care, Queensland Brenntag, Renovis, American Water and others.\r\n On the product front, in Q1, Veritone higher introduced market leading predictive performance capabilities on an individual job basis, cookie-less ad tracking technology that led to 20% improvement of tracking accuracy and campaigns previously tracked by third-party cookies and self-serve features to expand the customer base of core programmatic solutions shifting to media entertainment across software products and services within media and entertainment. We had a robust start to the year, headlined by momentum in customer renewals, an uptick in new business and the achievement of significant technological milestones. Notably, our asked Gary solution.\r\n Our new generative, AI media intelligence and natural language tool was honored with the prestigious NAV Product of the Year Award, marking our fifth win at NAB. At this time, in the AI and machine learning category at a time in which one of generative AI. most prominent use cases is content creation. Asbury enables the democratization of data exploration and activation to provide value from content investments. Asbury empowers Veritone digital media hub or DMH. users to quickly extract actionable insights and execute dynamic workflows from their media archive and is an integrated solution on Veritone's aiWARE platform. We are thrilled to announce that Asbury will soon be available across the majority of Veritone's commercial and public sector applications.\r\n In Q1, we entered partnerships with both Gillette and grab-and-go, showcasing our partner-driven channel approach and that other companies servicing the media and entertainment industry both need and rely on Veritone within media and entertainment we executed over 23 new deals in the first quarter with a total contract value of $1.97 million and bookings reaching $1.6 million among the highlights of new business wins in the quarter, we secured deals with prominent media organizations such as Summit Media, the U.S. soccer federations and NBC Universal.\r\n Our commitment to client satisfaction is reflected in the 14 renewal deals closed in Q1 with total contract value of over $1 million and bookings totaling almost $850,000. Notable renewals include partnerships with Beasley media, profit broadcasting and Augusta National. Furthermore, we've executed several substantial upsells in Q1, including partnerships with Golf Magazine and Sony Pictures, entertainment, underscoring our strong customer retention metrics and the tangible value we bring to our customers.\r\n We achieved several technology milestones in Q1 with notable achievements, including the enhancement of Veritone search capabilities, which now significantly outperforms and recall empowering clients to adversely query their media and data lake archives using natural language within our advertising and intelligence product suite, we introduced updates adding support for Google BigQuery, Adobe customer website, pixels and other industry benchmarks, augmenting the depth of insights provided to our media and advertising partners. Launch of media analytics on our DMH. platform empowers customers with comprehensive reporting around media monetization, ingestion analytics, cognitive analytics and engine optimization to name a few.\r\n In Q1, we announced feature enhancements to our advertising and content intelligence suite designed to embrace data privacy. Our solutions support the safeguarding of ad revenues for our customers by providing data granularity, privacy and security. Our AI assistant content licensing business continues to thrive and demonstrate significant partner growth supported by a diverse base of content, customers and buyers. Notably, during Q1, we witnessed the meteoric rise in women's sports and record-breaking professional sports ratings, driven largely by the global phenomenon of Kaitlyn Clark during the Women's March Madness basketball championship.\r\n This created a unique opportunity for both content owners and creators to leverage near real-time events to drive special and unique content moments rather than advertisements news briefings or documentaries. In Q one, Veritone had various new client wins such as the professional fighters league and played a pivotal role in facilitating near real-time moments for companies such as State Farm, Nike, Invesco, Apple studios, and many more as the advertising market rebounds from a challenging 2023, our agency group seized opportunities to expand customer advertising campaigns for our clients. Annual bookings remained strong for the year and are on track to surpass our previous record, while the overall digital streaming and podcasting sector saw significant Internet growth rates of around 7% in 2023.\r\n Our agency Group's endeavor surpassed these numbers by a considerable margin. In Q1 2024, we signed four new advertising customers Bolon branch, GAB national debt and notice with three additional exciting launches subsequent to the quarter's end, our advertising customers' pipeline remains strong with numerous new advertisers in various stages of contracting and discussions positioning us for continued success throughout the year.\r\n One of the most notable new advertising customers recently signed is Chewy the largest direct to consumer pet supplies company across media and entertainment. We continue to see a strong validated pipeline of $11 million with significant opportunities across both new and existing customers. Our newly launched a consulting and services group stands well-positioned to help these median entertainment Titans accelerate their business goals and drive immediate value for their organizations by leveraging AI.\r\n Finally, I would like to comment on Veritone's public sector business building on the progress made in the previous quarters, we've achieved significant milestones and made substantial strides in delivering AI-powered solutions that address the unique needs of the public sector in Q1 2024. In the first quarter, we welcomed 19 new public sector customers to the portfolio. Notably, we updated and released our contact application to meet the new requirements set forth by the California Department of Justice for rapid data collection with over 14,000 police officers and supervisors now utilizing Veritone contact, we continue to expand our reach and providing cutting-edge solutions to support law enforcement agencies.\r\n Our collaboration with AppNexus, a technical integration partner, has already produced encouraging results. During Q1, we closed three deals with federal clients, and our pipeline is steadily expanding with a promising funnel in North America, particularly in Canada as well as with the U.S. federal government and U.S. SLED. Furthermore, we onboarded three new public sector resellers in Q1 and each has already established customer meetings and creating new opportunities for growth at a time in which law enforcement agencies are facing mounting pressure to modernize their operations, coupled with the pressures of fluctuating budgetary constraints, Veritone Redact to gain traction with seven new revenue-generating customers, highlighting the value and efficiency of our managed services offering to the public sector organizations.\r\n Our partnership with WSI. technologies to automate public record request for our primary statewide law enforcement agency marks a significant milestone for the public sector. State law enforcement agency will use our AI-powered Redact tool to automate its audio and video redaction workflows, reducing lengthy manual processes, conserve internal resources and address the ever-increasing Freedom of Information Act via request backlog with a solution like Veritone Redact. These agencies can significantly alleviate the manual and laborious process of audio and video redaction and get back to what matters most protecting and serving their communities in newly launched Veritone items.\r\n Applications gained traction in international markets, including Canada, the UK and Ireland. In Q1, we enhanced our items suite by adding a secure large language model deployed on a customer-by-customer basis. This addition ensures that the usage of our Veritone Lm technology remains secure and is not shared outside of their organization with multiple wins and new funnel growth during the quarter. Our items applications continue to resonate with global public sector entities. Our achievements already realized in 2024 demonstrate our dedication to serving as a trusted partner in the public sector and the immense opportunity ahead to broaden our footprint across countries, cities, agencies and municipalities globally, reflecting on the first quarter of 2024.\r\n I am proud of the substantial progress made possible by our talented and dedicated Veritone team. We will continue to take disciplined measures to enact cost savings and operational enhancements throughout the year, aligning with our plan to position Veritone's operating model for long-term agility, serve true customer demand and secure our lead in delivering advanced efficient AI solutions to our customers and partners. While generative AI has experienced an explosion in the market and is maturing rapidly is important to recognize that we are still in the early innings.\r\n Many enterprises remain largely in experimental and pilot phases and the adoption of AI. has only seen modest growth thus far with fewer than 5% of companies reporting using generative AI in regular production according to Goldman Sachs, as evidenced by our strong financial performance, new business wins and technological milestones. In Q1, Veritone has emerged from this transition stronger and better positioned to harness the immense opportunities of more mainstream enterprise-wide AI adoption that lie in the quarters and years to come. I am confident in our ability to maintain continued momentum throughout 2024 and look forward to providing an update on our progress in August.\r\n Now I'd like to hand the call off to Mike Symmetra, our CFO, to go through our financial results and guidance in more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Zemetra\n\nThank you, Ryan. I'm happy to report that we continued to execute at a high level in Q1 2024, with solid customer metrics and contributions made across our software products and services and managed services more importantly, we ended Q1 with better than expected revenue results in line on costs and executed on significant changes to our cost structure, keeping us on target towards operating cash flow profitability neutrality on a non-GAAP basis as early as Q4 2024.\r\n During my prepared remarks, I will discuss our Q1 year-over-year performance and KPIs Q1 2024 our cost reduction initiatives and Q2 and fiscal 2024 guidance, highlighting the scalability of our revenue and business, including the risks heading into fiscal 2024, focus on near-term profitability and projected full year results, starting with Q1 2024 performance revenue was $31.6 million, up 4.5% or $1.4 million from Q1 2023, driven by an increase of $1.1 million for software products and services and $0.3 million for managed services.\r\n The increase in software products and services was largely driven by Veritone higher, which improved $1.1 million as compared to Q1 2023, largely driven by the Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadview, which generated $8.5 million in revenue in Q1 2024, offset by the expected decline of legacy Veritone higher revenue over the same period, including Amazon by comparison Amazon represented approximately 18% of consolidated revenue in Q1 2023 as compared to less than 5% in Q1 2024. Excluding the impact of Amazon, Q1 software products and services revenue would have increased over 75% in Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023. Our revenue pipeline and long-term outlook remains strong as we continue to diversify our customer base throughout fiscal 2024.\r\n Our partner-driven channel strategy continues to deliver results. In Q1, we delivered strong key performance metrics on a pro forma basis, ARR of $72.1 million, including $48.6 million from subscription versus consumption-based customers, which represents an improvement of 7% from Q1 2023. And over 67% of our total ARR. While our subscription-based ARR grew year over year, our overall ARR declined given the trailing 12-month pullback in consumption spending principally from customers, including Amazon.\r\n We expect assumption base ARR to continue to decline in the first half of 2024 as we exit Amazon dependencies over the trailing 12 month periods. Total new bookings were [13 million] down year over year, largely due to Amazon's reduced spend. Gross revenue retention continued to be in the [high 90th] percentile and total software products and services customers of 3,384, which were down slightly year over year, principally due to reductions in legacy CareerBuilder accounts, transition of our higher platform post the acquisition of Broadview and to a lesser extent, from smaller ACV accounts across Veritone higher as we prioritize renewals and larger ACV customers.\r\n In Q1 2024, the overall decline had a minimal impact as overall ARR from subscription based customers improved year over year and was relatively flat sequentially from Q4 2024. Q1, managed service Advertising gross billings per active client were 793,000, improving slightly from Q1 2023 and over 20% sequentially from Q4 2023. Given our performance bookings through today and expected macro economic improvements in the second half of 2024.\r\n We anticipate advertising to improve as early as Q2 2024 versus Q2 2023 and throughout the remainder of 2024 as compared to 2023 Q1 2024. Non-GAAP gross profit reached $24.6 million, improving $1.1 million or 4.8% from Q1 2023, largely due to the increase in revenue. Overall, non-GAAP gross margins in Q1 2024 of 77.7% or relatively flat year over year, we expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins to approximate 78% to 80% throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024. Q1 non-GAAP net loss was $7.6 million, an improvement of $2 million or over 20% as compared to non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million in Q1 2023. This was driven largely by the improvements in non-GAAP gross profit, coupled with the reductions in our cost structure over the trailing 12 months, which included significant cost reductions in the mid to latter part of Q1 2024, which I will explain in detail later.\r\n Turning to our balance sheet. At March 31st, 2024, we held cash and restricted cash of $91.7 million compared to $80.3 million at December 31st, 2023. The $11.4 million increase reflects net cash inflows from operations of $15.9 million, driven principally by the timing of payments in managed services in Q1 of 2024 our non-GAAP net loss and approximately $1.3 million of one-time transition and severance expenses associated with our Q1 2024 restructuring.\r\n Offsetting this was net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.9 million, driven by capital expenditures and $2.8 million of deferred purchase consideration from fiscal 2022 acquisitions. Total interest paid on our debt was $1.1 million in Q1 2024 which was offset by interest income earned from cash from June of $0.6 million.\r\n At March 31st, 2024, we had consolidated debt of $168.5 million principal, of which $77.5 million is term debt and the remaining $91 million convertible debt due November 2026, beginning. in June 2024, we will begin amortizing our term debt principal balance at the rate of 2.5% per quarter. As we discussed on our last call, we remain on a near term pathway and are progressing to vastly improve our liquidity position on a non-dilutive basis. We will continue to update you on further progress on this initiative.\r\n We announced Q2 earnings in August 2024 of the total $91.7 million in cash, approximately $73.3 million of our reported cash is essentially held for payment to third parties from our managed services, up from $45.3 million at December 31st, 2023.\r\n Turning to our cost savings initiatives, including March 31st, 2024, we have executed over $37 million of annualized savings since the beginning of 2023. During Q1 2024, we completed over $13 million of annualized cost reductions, which is included in our full year due to 2024 financial guidance. On top of this phase of reorganization, we expect future synergies, both cost and revenue to materialize in the latter part of fiscal 2024, largely from integration of past acquisitions across our software products and services lines. Q1 restructuring included organizational realignments within sales engineering and corporate, the result of which was a reduction of approximately 13% of our global workforce, total one-time severance and transition costs for $2 million, of which approximately $1.3 million was paid in Q1 2024 with $0.7 million to be paid throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024.\r\n Additionally, we executed on a little over $1 million of annualized cost savings in late April 2024 bringing our total reduction to 14% of our global workforce. We ended March 31st, 2024, with 37.6 million shares outstanding and approximately [2.7 million] five-year warrants outstanding under our December 2023 debt facility at a strike price of $2.57. during Q1 2024 be net settled 349,000 warrant shares in exchange for 207,000 shares of common stock.\r\n Looking ahead to Q2 2024. I want to point out certain one-time cash items, cash payments of $2.5 million associated with amortization of our term debt, cash interest payments of up to $3.7 million associated with our term convertible debt and cash proceeds of $1.8 million associated with the sale of our energy investment in April 2024.\r\n Turning to financial guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2024. As a backdrop to fiscal 2024, we approached our planning with a very conservative approach on revenue, particularly on any consumption-based revenue and with heightened discipline around costs as we march towards profitability. As previously mentioned, in Q1 2024, we executed over $13 million of annualized cost savings initiatives, which is included in our guide that intentionally omitted from our 2024 guidance.\r\n Any future cost and revenue synergies expected in the second half of 2024 until they are realized. With that backdrop, we are guiding Q2 revenue to be between $31 million and $32 million, representing a [13%] improvement year over year at the midpoint, driving this growth and Veritone higher, including the addition of broad beam and growth from our managed services, including advertising, our managed services is expected to begin accelerating with more significant growth coming in Q2 2024 as we begin to exit a more challenging 2024 macro and continue to grow our bookings with new and existing customers, but continue to see strong bookings across our advertising services with Q2 pacing in excess of 10% year over year.\r\n Offsetting these growth drivers will be legacy Veritone higher applications more specifically, Q2 2024 assumes Amazon will be less than 5% of our consolidated revenue as compared to 14% of our consolidated revenue in Q2 2023 risks and upside to our Q2 revenue guidance include execution on new enterprise deliverables, Amy, across our public sector, which can be unpredictable and to a lesser extent, consumption-based revenue across our higher and managed services in Q2, quarterly non-GAAP net loss to be between $5.5 million and $6.5 million, an improvement of 54% at the midpoint versus Q2 2023, driving this improvement in the bottom line, our legacy cost reductions, which we will fully begin realizing in Q2 2024.\r\n As a reminder, Q2 is one of our seasonally lowest performing quarters, and the majority of our costs are fixed and payroll driven for full year 2024, we are increasing the bottom end of our revenue range to be between $136 million and $142 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint and relatively flat versus pro forma 2024. As a reminder, and given the current economic outlook, we are forecasting our revenue conservatively driving 2024. We expect software products and services to benefit from the Q2 2023 for IBM acquisition, our public sector, which is projected to grow between 40% to 50% year over year, of which over 75% of that growth is coming from our exit 2024 run rate.\r\n Moreover, we remain in late agreement stages with various federal agencies for larger enterprise-level arrangements, which if executed in the first half of 2024 could accelerate this growth projection even further, we expect our managed services, including our advertising to improve over 15% year over year, led by advertising and licensing starting in Q2 2024. Offsetting this is a year-over-year decline in consumption-based revenue, including Amazon and certain one-time software sales of $3 million in 2023, not recurring in 2024.\r\n Amazon is projected to conservatively represent less than 5% of our consolidated revenue at the midpoint as compared to 11% in 2024. If we exclude the impact of these, our revenue guidance would be over 20% improvement in 2024 versus 2023. Restoring annual revenue guidance include the macro economy and the result of continued inflation and higher interest rates on our customers, which we expect to continue at least through the first half of 2024 execution on new enterprise deliverables namely across our public sector and continued customer growth and retention metrics from our software products and services.\r\n We expect full year non-GAAP net loss to be between $11 million and $15 million with substantial progress towards profitability beginning in the second half of 2024. At the midpoint, this represents a $24.3 million or over 65% improvement when compared to fiscal 2023 non-GAAP net loss. Assuming we reached the higher end of our guidance, we expect we will be cash flow positive on a non-GAAP basis as early as Q4 2024. Further, in assuming modest revenue growth in fiscal 2025, we should be cash flow positive on a non-GAAP basis for the entirety of fiscal 2025.\r\n Turning to a few updates. We will be presenting at the following investor conferences in May 2024 the 19th annual Needham Technology Media and Consumer Conference in New York City, May 14th through May 16th, and EF. Hutton Annual Global Conference in New York City May 15th. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open up the call for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question. You may press star then one on your touchtone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. First question comes from Stephen Banta with Banta Asset Management. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Banta\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the call or the question here and congrats on a solid quarter. Just wanted to see if you can comment a little bit more again on your target for cash flow profit profitability in Q4? And then maybe a little bit on the today's announcement on whether you expect anything material in '24 look into '25.\n\nRyan Steelberg\n\nThank you. And thanks for joining the call. And I think we talked touched on a few different points on why we're bullish on kind of our year-end guide towards profitability. And as we mentioned we continue to execute very effectively on the cost-savings initiatives. I'll just give you some perspective in if you include the $13 million of realized the annualized savings that we achieved in Q1, and that is part of almost $37 million in total savings that we've been able to and really identify and pull out of the business going back to the beginning of 2023 and right?\r\n So those efforts have been very, very beneficial to radically change the profile of the business. And so if you take the combination of those and additional cost savings. And we touched on a little bit the opportunity for potentially even further synergies in the future, both revenue and cost savings. And you combine that with our improvement in our bookings and our revenues. Despite Amazon contracting less than 5% in the quarter, it paints a paints a solid picture and based upon sort of our confidence of improving our guide for the year with, I'd say, very conservative positioning. You can sort of understand why we're bullish for not just for 2024. But as we move into 2025.\r\n And the second question is, when you touched on was, I think about our press release this morning about Veritone expanding and from from being just a an ISP., a software based vendor in the eyes of hyperscalers and partners like AWS and but to a full-fledged and a AI based Consulting and Services Group. And we view this as a critical component for many of our customers who not only will continue to buy at very high margins, our market-leading software applications and services. And but they need I mean have they sort of across the board their need for AI guidance, workflow development workshop and definitive like platform development. And some of this goes back to cloud cloud migration.\r\n So we can help them prepare their data for AI opportunity. And there's a lot of demand. I think we've left a lot of revenue on the table looking in arrears. So we're very excited about sort of introducing this entirely new service offerings. And I think it's sort of a testament that we're kind of kind of starting this at the advanced tier level with AWS, who's been a great partner and we're excited about what this new endeavor will provide.\r\n The only thing I would comment on this is we've been very, very conservative and with the contributions of this new services and consulting arm for 2024. But we do expect bookings in calendar year 2024, and we do expect this to be a major part of our business and going forward in 2025 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Alex Sharps with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Sharps\n\nHey, guys. Good afternoon. I was curious if you guys had any updates surrounding the $15 million blanket purchase agreement with the DOJ that you guys mentioned on the last call. Thanks.\n\nRyan Steelberg\n\nAnd so we're actively servicing against that, and we weren't going to be able to shared specific deals, but we are prosecuting and executing against paid task orders. And under that BPA, we're hopeful about that can we hope and aim to exhaust that over the next several quarters. And to be clear, that's not I'd say the and the end of the opportunity we're doing a lot of work across the board with various agencies, both in fed civ and fed DoD. And but again, the BPA is an important vehicle for us, and we are already executing and servicing business and accounts against that $15 million bar preapproved pre-approved budget.\n\nOperator\n\nAgain, if you have a question, please press star then one Seeing no further questions this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ryan Steelberg for any closing remarks.\n\nRyan Steelberg\n\nThank you. I'm very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2024 and very, very excited about our prospects for the year. Veritone has clearly established itself as a leader in the enterprise AI market with a strong and diverse customer base award, winning and market-leading applications and technologies and a very talented team of professionals driving us forward. And AI is well on its way to being deployed and integrated as a foundational technology and driving critical workflows and efficiencies for nearly every business. And we, at Veritone look to continue to lead this charge and really accelerate what is humanly possible. Thank you for your time today, and we look forward speaking with you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings",
        "content": "Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.\n\nDespite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are once again on investors’ radars.\n\nAnalysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings, noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.\n\nApart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization. And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.\n\nAs a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.\n\nStory continues\n\niShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) iShares by Blackrock sign\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.\n\nTherefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW) stands out as a compelling choice. This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.\n\nSince its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.\n\nAmong its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).\n\nIYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.\n\nRecently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.\n\nInvestors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.\n\nSo far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil had both long and short positions in META stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Amazon.com is US$304 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$189 suggests Amazon.com is potentially 38% undervalued Analyst price target for AMZN is US$217 which is 29% below our fair value estimate\n\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$62.4b US$79.0b US$102.7b US$116.6b US$141.2b US$159.6b US$175.2b US$188.5b US$199.8b US$209.7b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x16 Analyst x19 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Est @ 12.98% Est @ 9.80% Est @ 7.57% Est @ 6.02% Est @ 4.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$58.2k US$68.8k US$83.4k US$88.4k US$99.8k US$105.2k US$107.8k US$108.2k US$107.0k US$104.8k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$932b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$210b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.4%) = US$4.5t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.5t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$2.2t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.2t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$189, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.044. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

        "content": "Millennials are a driving force within the global economy. Younger generations are splurging more often, which creates opportunities for companies that can win their loyalty.\n\nSome corporations will continue to attract consumer spending from multiple generations. However, some relatively new brands are gobbling up market share from their competitors.\n\nKnowing what millennials want can help investors generate long-term returns. While many businesses have millennial customer bases, these three Millennial stocks are enticing money magnets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s hard to beat the level of convenience and quality that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides. The company has millions of product listings that can arrive at your door within a day or two. The tech giant was a big hit before Millennials, but it has staying power for multiple generations.\n\nThe company continues to grow despite having a large market share in the e-commerce industry. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year (YoY) in Q1 2024, as sales in North America and international markets remained strong.\n\nAmazon Web Services also performed well in the quarter and grew by 17% YoY. This cloud computing segment will continue to attract money from businesses. Some of these companies are Millennial-owned, but many of them serve Millennials. Artificial intelligence is also fueling the rising demand for cloud computing.\n\nAnalysts believe the stock can continue to march higher as it wins more consumers within the demographic. The stock is projected to gain 16% from current levels. It’s rated as a Strong Buy among 41 analysts.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nMillennials need to buy sneakers and clothing, and they’ll gravitate toward trendy, innovative companies. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) fits the bill as it continues to gain market share from bigger rivals with its HOKA and UGG product lines.\n\nAlthough the stock is currently in the middle of a correction, it’s still a leader. Deckers Outdoor shares are up 30% year-to-date and have surged by 503% over the past five years. Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased by 16% YoY to reach a record $1.56 billion. Net income growth was also solid, as profits soared by 40% YoY.\n\nMillennials aren’t the only ones who believe in the company. Analysts are projecting an 11% upside from current levels and have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The highest price target of $1,110 per share implies a 29% upside from current levels. Deckers Outdoor trades at a reasonable 31 P/E ratio and has demonstrated it can improve profit margins. Net profit margins came in at 25.0% in Q3 FY24.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nThe sports beverage is capturing more market share and continues to fly off the shelves. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers a healthier alternative to other sports drinks. Millennials and Gen Z consumers are more conscious about their health and have been grabbing this drink in force.\n\nRevenue more than doubled in full-year 2023. Sales were up 95% YoY in Q4 2023, reaching $347 million. The company also strengthened its profit margins. Celsius Holdings reported $39.1 million in Q4 2023 net income compared to a $28.2 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nIts stock has soared along with the drink’s success. The stock is up 45% year-to-date and has soared almost 5,000% over the past five years. CELH shares currently trade at a 69 forward P/E ratio. The beverage company’s continued expansion into international markets should create more opportunities and lead to high revenue growth for several years.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Pilgrim's,  Enterprise Products, Lancaster Colony, Amazon and Agnico Eagle",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – May 8, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Pilgrim's Pride PPC, Enterprise Products Partners EPD, Lancaster Colony Corp. LANC, Amazon.com AMZN and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. AEM.\n\nDon't \"Sell in May and Go Away,\" Follow These 5 Strategies Instead\n\nWall Street regained momentum at the start of May on the back of solid corporate earnings and renewed bets for Fed rate cuts. In fact, major indices have risen in the last three days, with the S&P 500 logging its best three-day run of 2024. Meanwhile, Treasury yields wrapped up the last week with the biggest weekly drop in at least three months.\n\nWill the rebound continue for the rest of the month, given the weak seasonal trends? After all, the adage “Sell in May and Go Away” says investors should sell their stocks in May and re-enter the market in November to capitalize on the historically strong performance of equities between November and April. It denotes traditional market underperformance during the summer months (May to October).\n\nIn such a scenario, investors might consider several investment strategies to navigate the May-October period more effectively, which could lead to a winning portfolio.\n\nBehind the Recent Rally\n\nThe picture emerging from the first-quarter earnings season continues to be one of steady improvement and resilience, with the earnings growth pace modestly accelerating and estimates for the coming periods starting to increase. Total earnings of the 310 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up 5% from the same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues, with 78.1% beating EPS estimates and 59.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nA softer-than-expected jobs report revived bets for an earlier rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The United States added a lower-than-expected 175,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 3.9%. After growing for 15 consecutive months, U.S. service sector activity also unexpectedly contracted in April. The futures market is now pricing in at least two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Traders are now wagering that the central bank will begin trimming rates as soon as September but still maintained only around a 44% probability of such a scenario, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.\n\nIn another recent weak data, consumer confidence dopped last month to the lowest since mid-2022. Additionally, the world's biggest economy had a weak start to the year due to lower consumer and government spending amid growing inflation. The economy expanded at the slowest pace in two years, with GDP rising 1.6% annually in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the weak data has pushed up bets for sooner-than-expected rate cuts lately, the Fed signaled that its fight against inflation will continue for a longer period, setting the stage for a period of extended higher rates. In its latest meeting, the Fed kept interest rates steady at a 23-year high in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, citing a “lack of further progress” on inflation. Powell reiterated that it will now take longer than expected for the Fed to reach the confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. This indicates that rate cuts are not in the cards anytime soon.\n\nWill Elections Make a Difference?\n\nVolatility and uncertainty are expected to increase as this is a Presidential election year in the United States. But, according to Carson Group data going back to 1950, stocks have historically rallied during the summer in presidential election years. The S&P 500 rose 2.3% on average during the May to October period during election years and was higher 77.8% of the times. Per Schaeffer’s research, the S&P’s average six-month return leading up to a Presidential election in early November is 4.67%, which compares with 2.14% in non-election years and 0.95% in mid-term election years.\n\nInvestment Strategies to Follow\n\nSector Rotation\n\nRotating the investments in sectors that have historically performed well during the May-October period, such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, could be beneficial. The consumer staples and healthcare sectors have climbed 4.1% on average during the hotter months since 1990, outperforming the broader market’s 2.1% advance, according to CFRA Research.\n\nPilgrim's Pride, which is engaged in the processing, production, marketing and distribution of frozen, fresh as well as value-added chicken products, seems an excellent option. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 50 cents over the past seven days for this year with an estimated growth rate of 107.7%. The stock has a solid VGM Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nDividend Investing\n\nFocusing on dividend-paying stocks can provide a steady income stream and help mitigate potential losses during weaker market periods. These stocks offer the best of both worlds — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that pay dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), can fit well in this category. It is among the leading midstream energy players in North America, with a market cap of $60.9 billion. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 6.7%. EPD sports a dividend yield of 7.33% annually and has a VGM Score of A.\n\nLow-Beta Focus\n\nLow-beta stocks exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling. Though these have fewer risks and lower returns, the stocks are considered safe and resilient amid market turbulence.\n\nLancaster Colony Corp. is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice markets. It saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending June 2024) with an estimated growth rate of 35.4%. The stock has Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A.\n\nValue Addition\n\nValue investing is an investment strategy that focuses on purchasing stocks that are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Value stocks seek to capitalize on the inefficiencies in the market and have the potential to deliver higher returns with lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts. These are less susceptible to the trending markets and their dividend payouts offer safety in times of market turbulence.\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 44 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth of 56.5%. Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of B.\n\nQuality Bet\n\nQuality investing also seeks safety and protection against volatility. Quality stocks tend to outperform as these are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines Ltd. is a gold producer with mining operations in Canada, Mexico and Finland and exploration activities in Canada, Europe, Latin America and the United States.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Undervalued tech stocks are attracting eyeballs this year because of two elements: the astronomical rise of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the three anticipated rate cuts from the now more dovish Federal Reserve.\n\nThis is why the tech sector is up 13.5% so far this year, better than the S&P 500‘s 9% gain. Goldman Sachs says the index will return 6%, which includes dividends, which means to beat the market this year, invest in undervalued tech stocks.\n\nAnalysts have given all three of the undervalued tech stocks we will look at a “strong buy” rating with double-digit upsides. This is because they are all working on new ways to make AI more widely used and to protect data.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe first pick on this list of undervalued tech stocks is a cybersecurity expert teaming up with AWS and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The second has a platform with over 200 million customers and wants to expand beyond Taiwan by including sports broadcasts and speedier delivery. The final selection partners with the U.S. Department of Commerce to potentially receive $6.6 billion in funding for a new manufacturing factory in Arizona.\n\nCome on, let’s explore further!\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has made a big comeback and is now selling at around $188, which is up 25% from the start of the year, but most analysts are still recommending that investors “buy” the stock, with a target price of $219.5 per share for the next 12 months, a 16% upside.\n\nPart of the reason for optimism is consistent innovation and growth. For example, Amazon is working overtime to expand its Amazon Web Services (AWS) system. AWS opened a new region in Calgary, Canada, the company’s second infrastructure area in the country. Amazon has also created the AWS European Sovereign Cloud to meet the needs of businesses in Europe subject to strict rules.\n\nIn the meantime, CES 2024 saw Amazon and Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) announce a partnership to link Amazon Bedrock to Siemens’ Mendix platform. This alliance seeks to make creative AI technologies easy to use in many sectors.\n\nOn the streaming end, Amazon Prime Video is adding more sports shows from around the world, like NASCAR and Wimbledon tennis in certain regions.\n\nAMZN investors should monitor Amazon Prime, which includes the streaming business, since its 200 million users generated $40.2 billion in 2023. In 2021, growth was 33%; in 2023, 8%. Market saturation, notably in the U.S., caused this slowdown. Amazon is offering Prime members speedier delivery, exclusive bargains, and more entertainment, to stop the drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) investors are thrilled about its new deal with AWS, which will speed up the growth of AI and cloud security. The deal also includes making more use of Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker and standardizing security on CrowdStrike’s AI-native Falcon platform.\n\nCrowdStrike and Tata Consultancy Services have also made a global strategy deal to use Falcon XDR to change the way business hacking is done. Falcon’s combined protection, which includes cloud security and next-generation security information and event management (SIEM), will be available to TCS through this deal. This will allow AI-powered system-on-chip (SOC) change that stops hacks.\n\nThe National Australia Bank and CrowdStrike are also working together to keep small and medium-sized businesses safe online.\n\nThese interactions and partnerships have made CrowdStrike well-known in its sector. KuppingerColeand IDC rank it as a leader in Identity Threat Detection and Response and in the 2024 Worldwide Managed Detection and Response MarketScape.\n\nLastly, new ideas are a big part of CrowdStrike’s success and potential upside of 25%. CrowdStrike said at Google Cloud Next ’24 that it would also be adding new security tools to the Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and the U.S. Department of Commerce recently agreed to collaborate. As a result of the tie-up, TSMC could receive up to $6.6 billion in funds through the CHIPS Act.\n\nIt’s part of their plan to build a third manufacturing plant in Arizona. That plant will make advanced electronics. With this addition, TSMC will have invested over $65 billion in Arizona so far.​\n\nTSMC is also expanding its business worldwide, opening a second chipmaking plant in Japan. The new factory is part of Taiwan-based TSMC’s plan to increase the reliability of its supply chain and expand its production sites.​\n\nIn addition, India and TSMC are working together to see if it is possible to set up a hub for semiconductors there. This move is part of larger talks between Taiwan and India.\n\nThe excitement around chipmaker Nvidia is also helping TSMC’s shares. Thanks to its AI hardware solutions, Nvidia is the third U.S. firm with a $2 trillion market worth and is driving the tech-led market revival in 2024.\n\nTSMC’s shares rose after Morgan Stanley boosted its Nvidia target price, illustrating their correlation. However, TSMC does not need Nvidia to stand on its own feet; the stock holds a “strong buy” consensus rating, with a 16% projected upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy Now or Regret It for the Next Decade",
        "content": "If you’re looking for stocks to buy for the next decade, there are a lot to choose from, especially if you’re looking to buy on weakness. After all, buying on weakness can often help you realize outstanding returns over the long haul.\n\nIn addition, companies that have a well-established customer base and offer products with staying power are unlikely to disappoint in the long run. A big plus is if they have megatrend tailwinds that will boost them even further in the next 10 or so years. Here are seven such stocks to buy for the next decade.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) has been one of the hardest-hit stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYear to date, for example, it’s down about 29%. All thanks to news its planes were having severe maintenance issues. Worse, there were valid criticisms of how the company manufactures its planes and the potential negligence in the production line. These criticisms gave birth to even more trouble for Boeing, with two whistleblowers dying within a short span of each other.\n\nThe good news, though, is that with most of the negativity firmly priced into the Boeing stock, it created a buying opportunity. After all, Boeing is one of the world’s biggest suppliers of commercial passenger aircraft.\n\nAlso, at a time when China is expanding its own Boeing copy “COMAC,” I find it hard to believe that Boeing will not receive lots of support going forward. There are no big financial problems here, and once rate cuts kick in, I expect the stock to significantly outperform. BA EPS. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is a company that is very popular with the younger generation. This is primarily why I think CROX could perform well going forward.\n\nSince recommending CROX in mid-2022, it’s up 160%. However, I still strongly believe it can return even more in the next decade.\n\nHelping, analysts believe EPS expansion will be around 8-9% annually going forward, along with mid-single-digit revenue growth in the next few years. These aren’t stellar numbers by any means. However, I still expect it to outperform those expectations, just as it has in every quarter since Q2 2020. It has also made smart acquisitions, like HEYDUDE. Plus, cash flow growth for CROX has been impressive. crocs cash flow. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nIn my opinion, international markets will be where Crocs shines the most in the coming years. In Q4, International Crocs revenue jumped 24.9% to $261.2 million. DTC revenue soared 40.0%, while wholesale revenue jumped 18.3%. Asia revenue jumped 36%, with Europe up 16%.\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is an e-commerce company that is also up triple digits since I first started covering it. And, again, I see a lot more gains going forward. E-commerce is certainly the future, and more businesses are expanding their outreach by listing their products online.\n\nA lot of small and mid-sized businesses use Shopify for this. Granted, they can use Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for this, but Shopify allows businesses to have their own dedicated e-commerce sites. SHOP revenue. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nA metric that makes me really bullish is the merchant count. Shopify’s merchant count is growing fast, and so is the volume. Analysts expect EPS to grow over 5X from $1 to $5.4 from 2024 to 2033, along with revenue growing from $8.6 billion to $35.1 billion in the same period. I think the current premium for the stock is worth it with this sort of growth. FCF was $905 million in 2023 compared to -$186 million in 2022. SHOP FCF. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the biggest winners since 2022. It’s also one that could continue to deliver stellar returns over the next decade.\n\nThe stock checks all the boxes. First, this is a company that is well-positioned to exploit the biggest tech breakthrough we’ve seen in decades, which is artificial intelligence (AI). Some even think the AI windfall will end up being bigger than the internet.\n\nThe second is that this company is sort of like the underdog here, and AMD already has a lot of experience being the underdog. AMD is currently lagging behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the AI chips sector just as it was lagging Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a few decades before in the CPU sector.\n\nAMD is working on AI chips that can rival those of Nvidia in the next few years and already has MI300. In my view, AMD can repeat history and dethrone Nvidia in the AI chips space just as it managed to crack Intel’s CPU dominance. Even if it doesn’t, you’re unlikely to see losses with a company like AMD.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (UAL) a picture of an airplane flying with the sun in the background. Airline Stocks to Buy and Hold\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUnited Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is one of the biggest airline companies, and it almost doubled its debt load from $20.5 billion in 2019 to $39.4 billion in 2021.\n\nTaking on this much debt to keep the business afloat was a necessary evil. Unfortunately, it also created substantial long-term issues. For example, with sky-high interest rates, the company has been forced to pay ~$430 million in interest expenses every quarter on average since Q3 2020. This has put a dent in profits. However, the company has been recovering very well and paying off debt despite this pressure. UAL interest expense. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nDebt is down to $32.3 billion as of Q1, with $14 billion in cash. Moreover, the three-year free cash flow growth rate is at 66.6%. In addition, the three-year sales growth rate is 43.3%. I think this is a remarkable rebound, which should translate into the stock bouncing much higher in the coming years as well.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a controversial pick, but I find it hard to believe that this company won’t deliver stellar gains if you hold it for the next decade. It is going through near-term weakness mainly due to rate hikes that have caused many consumers to pull back on big-ticket purchases that involve borrowing. Once rates come down, we should see a rebound in sales and the momentum should continue. Tesla sales estimates. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nThe thing that makes me really bullish about Tesla is that there is simply no competition here in the West. Many Chinese EV companies and startups are doing well right now, but those are unlikely to ever dominate the U.S. market. The EV startups that are in the U.S. are burning billions in cash with no light at the end of the tunnel. Tesla looks like the obvious winner in the EV space.\n\nBofA Securities analyst John Murphy upgraded their rating to buy from neutral and affirmed a $220 price target. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained an Overweight rating and a $310 price target.\n\nOuster (OUST) Graphic demonstrating self-driving car technology\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOuster (NYSE:OUST) is also an indirect automotive pick, but the stock can benefit from the booming robotics market as well. It is a lidar supplier and it has been delivering robust gains recently. The stock is up 120% in the past year and I think it can deliver quadruple-digit gains in the next decade if the stars align.\n\nLidar is better than radar and camera technology but is prohibitively expensive for automakers to adopt. However, lidar costs have been coming down, and many companies are trying it out.\n\nIn my opinion, if the current trajectory continues, costs could come down enough for it to be adopted more widely. Ouster is expected to see its revenue grow from $116.2 million in 2024 to $2.2 billion in 2030. It is not profitable yet, but profitability is expected in 2027 with significant expansion afterward. It also has $190 million in cash to provide a buffer against near-term losses.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That's a Once-in-a-Generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) Buying Opportunity Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are no stranger to artificial intelligence (AI). These leaders in technology have been investing in the area to either improve their internal processes or to develop products. The \"Magnificent Seven,\" a reference to the 1960 Western, led the Nasdaq and S&P 500's gains last year, and most continue to soar higher this year too -- thanks to their promising long-term outlooks.\n\nBut just one of these top stocks represents a once-in-a-generation AI buying opportunity right now. The company benefits from AI in two ways, by using AI itself and selling AI tools. This innovator is already generating revenue from its AI investments and aims to play a central role in the development of this red-hot technology. The company has a long track record of profitability, and considering all of its positive points, trades for a bargain price today -- offering investors a unique buying opportunity. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA leader in two high-growth areas\n\nFirst, a quick look at the list of Magnificent Seven companies. They include Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, and each one offers interesting growth prospects. The once-in-a-generation buying opportunity, though, is Amazon, a leader in the two high-growth fields of e-commerce and cloud computing -- and a potential AI powerhouse.\n\nAmazon already has started reaping the rewards of its early investments in AI, reporting a more than $100 billion annualized run rate for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is focused on AI, offering a wide variety of products and services for every \"layer\" of AI needs.\n\nFor example, AWS offers a broad range of chips -- from Nvidia's to its own lower-priced chips for the cost-conscious customer -- for companies training large language models (LLMs). For customers who don't want to start from the ground up, Amazon offers a fully managed service that allows them to customize top LLMs for their own projects. Finally, Amazon also builds AI apps such as Amazon Q, a generative AI assistant for software developers.\n\nAnd AWS is well positioned to attract AI business since it's the world's No. 1 cloud services provider -- so it already has a huge audience ready to learn about its latest products and services.\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" chief executive officer Andy Jassy wrote in his recent shareholder letter.\n\nThe early days of a game-changing technology\n\nAnd this brings me to the subject of the once-in-a-generation investment opportunity: investing in a key player in AI's early days. Amazon says that at least 85% of information technology spending right now is on-premises. As this shifts to the cloud, Amazon should benefit in a major way. On top of this, generative AI projects to be built directly on the cloud over the coming 20 years may add even more to growth, the company predicts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's important to remember Amazon also is benefiting from AI by applying these tools to its own business to lower costs and save time. For example, the company's robotics team is building AI models to perform a variety of tasks including handling workflow bottlenecks.\n\nToday, Amazon shares trade for about 41x forward earnings estimates, down from about 55x late last year. At the same time, the company's recent earnings reports are reason to be optimistic about the future. In the most recent quarter, sales rose in the double digits, net income more than tripled, and AWS sales and operating income soared as customers' budgets improved and AI demand increased. Analysts' annual growth estimates for Amazon over the coming five years are positive too, topping 30%.\n\nAll of this makes Amazon a standout long-term buying opportunity right now -- and one you may come across only once in a generation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

While some stocks posted adequate quarterly earnings, others really wowed Wall Street.\n\nThese exceptional performers not only exceeded expectations but also provided compelling outlooks, signaling strong potential for future growth.\n\nAs investors sift through the earnings reports to find winners, I must highlight three stocks that I have been impressed with and believe are poised for further upside potential.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nAmazon's recent earnings report painted a rosy picture, with profits exceeding expectations. The star of the show was their cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which saw significant growth fueled by the surging demand for AI capabilities. This strong performance in AWS underscores Amazon's prime position to capitalize on the booming AI market.\n\nAWS grew an impressive 17% YoY and brought in $25 billion in revenue for the quarter. Even more impressive was the $9.4 billion profit earned from the segment, demonstrating the huge margins the business enjoys.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Earnings estimates have been revised considerably higher over the last week and across timeframes. Furthermore, EPS are forecast to grow 29.6% annually, which is a very high pace of growth and among the highest of the mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nCoinbase Global\n\nCoinbase Global reported a stunning earnings beat last week, bringing in $4.40 of EPS, far exceeding analysts' expectations of $1.28. Revenue was 20% above estimates as well.\n\nMore than anything, Coinbase has a dominant role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially in the United States. As long as cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin especially remain in a bull market, Coinbase should be one of the primary beneficiaries.\n\nCoinbase Global currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflected by strongly upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings expectations have been unanimously upgraded by 250%-300%!\n\nCoinbase stock is also a powerful trading vehicle. The price action has regularly been consolidating and building out these descending wedges from which it breaks out aggressively from. If COIN stock can clear the $220 level it should make another attempt at its recent highs.\n\nTransdigm Group\n\nTransdigm Group soared in its second quarter, exceeding analysts’ expectations. Revenue jumped 20.5%, driven by strong demand across their aerospace platforms. Net income also rose significantly, with earnings per share up over 32% year-over-year. This positive performance reflects the ongoing recovery in the commercial aerospace industry, and TransDigm is well-positioned to benefit from continued growth in passenger traffic.\n\nStory continues\n\nTransdigm also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nTransdigm Group is a lesser-followed stock that has consistently delivered exceptional long-term returns. As a leading manufacturer of aerospace components and systems, TransDigm specializes in producing highly engineered products for use in commercial and military aircraft.\n\nDespite flying under the radar for many investors, TransDigm's unique business model and focus on high-quality, proprietary products have contributed to its impressive track record of growth and profitability. Over the years, TransDigm has demonstrated its ability to generate strong cash flow and consistently outperform market expectations, making it a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the aerospace industry.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile there were a number of strong earnings reported this quarter, these three stocks really jumped out to me. Not only are all of them regular market outperformers but are further bolstered by the top Zacks Ranks.\n\nFor investors looking to add exposure following earnings, these are three worthy considerations.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Amazon unveils first electric seaport trucks amid push to slash tailpipe emissions",
        "content": "(Adds Amazon executive comment in paragraph 7, Volvo executive comment in paragraph 9, Forum Mobility executive comment in paragraph 12)\n\nBy Lisa Baertlein\n\nLOS ANGELES, May 7 (Reuters) - Amazon.com on Tuesday unveiled the first of a dozen Volvo electric big rigs it plans to deploy this year to pick up cargo from the nation's busiest container seaport in Southern California.\n\nThe e-commerce giant already has eight of those semi trucks in use at the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, where every so-called drayage truck must be zero-emissions by 2035.\n\nThe deployment is a first for Amazon, extending its vehicle electrification projects from ocean ports to customer doorsteps. The effort is vital to the company's push to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\n\nSo far, a little more than 1% of the 23,761 trucks that serve the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex are zero-emission vehicles - including 201 electric rigs, Long Beach port spokesman Lee Peterson said.\n\n\"Heavy-duty trucking is a particularly difficult area to decarbonize,\" said Udit Madan, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations.\n\nThe company has rolled out more than 13,500 Rivian electric cargo delivery vans across the country since 2022. The transition to electric semi trucks will be a bigger lift, because they haul heavier loads and their batteries require more intensive charging infrastructure.\n\n\"There is no playbook,\" said Adam Baker, vice president of global logistics for Amazon. For now, the company is gathering data on battery performance that will help determine how many trucks will be needed.\n\nThe manufacturer of Amazon's electric drayage trucks will continue working with the company and JAB Hunt, which provides drivers for the rigs, throughout the deployment, said Keith Brandis, vice president of partnerships and system solutions at Volvo Trucks North America.\n\n\"Charging infrastructure is the long pole in the tent. We have to get that right,\" Brandis said.\n\nThe ports, private companies and truck owners are racing to build heavy-duty chargers to support the transition to zero-emissions vehicles.\n\nIn the near term, Amazon's electric port trucks will charge at an offsite facility operated by Forum Mobility, a startup that counts Amazon's Climate Pledge fund among its early investors.\n\nForum Mobility this week broke ground on a Port of Long Beach high-speed charging depot that can serve 44 trucks simultaneously. Amazon is the first customer for the site, which will also be open to other drayage truckers, Forum Mobility CEO Matt LeDucq said.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; editing by Deepa Babington and Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy now according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts.\n\nAs companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season. While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term \"AI\" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.\n\nWithin that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a \"trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure\" to transform computing from \"general purpose to accelerated.\"\n\nSince then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:\n\n\"So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.\n\nAnd, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward.\n\nFor Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that \"AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that \"60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) \"deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.\"\n\n\"And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\"\n\nSo, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with.

        "title": "Whole Foods CEO: The chain is investing in value and technology — with help from Amazon",
        "content": "Whole Foods is trying to juggle value and quality, as cautious consumers hunt for deals in the face of stubborn grocery inflation.\n\n\"We've increased the number of promotions for our customers ... as a result, we've actually seen double digit unit growth in promotional items,\" CEO Jason Buechel told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Tuesday.\n\nBelieve it or not, it's been seven years since Amazon (AMZN) acquired Whole Foods. Cutting prices to reaccelerate same-store sales growth was a key focus for the Street at the time. Now Buechel is aiming to strike the right balance.\n\nCost of groceries remained flat in March, and is up 1.2% year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The April read on CPI (consumer price index) is set to come out next week.\n\n\"Between commodities, labor, cost — inflation has been real,\" Buechel said.\n\nWhile Whole Foods shoppers, who are traditionally higher-income, are looking for cheaper prices, they aren't willing to compromise on quality, Buechel said.\n\nThey care about where the product was grown, raised, and produced, which comes at a higher cost, raising a challenge for the company.\n\n\"What we need to do is make sure that we can find a point where customers are happy with the value of the product and can appreciate the work that's gone into it. At the same time, [that] our Whole Foods sales and profits growing,\" he said.\n\nWhole Foods does not publicly share its results, but Buechel said team is \"proud\" of recent growth.\n\nDoubling down on private label is another avenue for growth. Buechel said the team is investing in lower prices for its 365 lines, as it looks to cater to all budgets.\n\nThis comes as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have been heavily investing in their own private label business. Last week, Walmart launched the Bettergoods brand, which focuses on affordable higher quality products, ranging from under $2 to under $15.\n\nBoth big box retailers are showing strength in their US grocery business, and gaining consumers across the income spectrum because of it.\n\n\"Walmart's in a double tailwind position to gain both low- and high-end consumers over the coming years,\" with 60% of the Walmart US sales coming from grocery alone, Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai told Yahoo Finance over the phone following its Q4 results.\n\nOn a recent earnings call, Target executive Rick Gomez said its food and beverage business brings in over $20 billion in annual sales, up from $8 billion in 2019. SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES - FEBRUARY 25: A woman uses a dash cart during her grocery-shopping at a Whole Foods store as Amazon launches smart shopping carts at Whole Foods stores in San Mateo, California, United States on February 25, 2024. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nWhole Foods is ramping up its expansion plans too.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent years, its store growth was in the single-digits. Now, there are 75 in development, with plans to open 30-plus stores a year. The company has over 500 locations in the US.\n\n\"From being single digits to that, that's an expansive growth trend that we've taken on ... we've got a lot of customer interest, a lot of communities that are looking for us to bring new stores,\" Buechel said.\n\nIt's also exploring new formats including smaller stores, for on-the-go customers in urban areas.\n\nAnd parent company Amazon is helping to build out the future of shopping. Its latest creation, a dash cart, allows you to weigh items and check out as you shop.\n\nBuechel says this technology will \"simplify\" the customer experience, and make shopping \"more engaging at the same time.\"\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This announcement coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s visit to Washington, highlighting the global focus on AI and domestic computing capabilities.\n\nDuring Kishida’s visit to the Kumamoto plant, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei declared TSMC’s target to source 60% of its materials locally by 2030 for its first chip manufacturing facility in Japan.\n\nThe Japanese government has heavily backed this venture, contributing ¥476 billion ($3.1 billion) to establish TSMC’s first factory and an additional ¥732 billion in subsidies for a second fabrication plant in the area.\n\nAmazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS has also disclosed plans to invest about 2.3 trillion yen ($15.5 billion) in Japan from 2023 to 2027.

        "title": "Rivian reports mixed Q1 results, but trims capex forecast and sees Q4 'gross profit'",
        "content": "Rivian (RIVN) reported mixed quarterly results for the first quarter, but will see further cost savings from shifting its upcoming R2 production to its Normal, Illinois, plant and trimmed its capital expenditure forecast. The EV-maker also reaffirmed its full-year loss forecast, and still sees a \"path\" to \"modest gross profit\" in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.204 billion versus $1.175 billion expected, which is an 80% jump from a year ago. However, Rivian posted an EPS loss of $1.45 versus $1.27 estimated, with an operating loss $1.484 billion compared to $1.299 billion loss expected.\n\nRivian reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA loss forecast of of $2.70 billion for 2024, but now sees its capital expenditure (capex) outlays improving to $1.2 billion from $1.75 billion seen earlier due to moving the start of R2 production to its Normal, IL plant, with further capex savings seen in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\"We hit several milestones this quarter, including producing our 100,000th vehicle in Normal, successfully navigating the retooling upgrade, and unveiling our new midsize platform which underpins the R2, R3, and R3X,\" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement.\n\nThe company also said as a result of its retooling upgrade and other improvements, Rivian remains \"confident in its path to achieving modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year.\"\n\nBy shifting R2 production to its existing US factory instead of its upcoming Georgia factory, Rivian said on Tuesday the company will save more than $2.25 billion with the move. The company now sees its Normal capacity following the R2 launch and plant changes to hit 215,000 units of total annual capacity across all vehicles, which includes up to 155,000 units of the R2.

(Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nIn terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it had $7.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter.\n\nLast month the company reported first quarter R1T and R1S production of 13,980 and deliveries of 13,588, topping expectations of around 12,400 units. The company also reaffirmed production guidance of 57,000 vehicles in 2024.\n\nPart of bringing down those costs came in the form of a 10% salaried staff reduction, with the company citing economic uncertainty. Though Rivian reaffirmed its forecast to reach “modest gross profit” by the end of 2024, Rivian didn't reiterate past statements that it was \"very close\" to achieving a positive contribution margin at the end of 2023.

(Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this year Rivian said its Georgia factory development is suspended for the moment, though Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe reaffirmed the company wasn’t abandoning the project.\n\nStory continues\n\nScaringe said once the R2 was ready for a larger rollout, the upcoming Georgia facility would handle the rollout. The company also said it would be launching its R2 in Europe, which would be a huge market for the company as it's not currently selling its larger R1 vehicles on the continent.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The 3 Best AI Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Given the rapid rise in AI relevancy, many have argued that AI stocks are currently in a bubble similar to the Dot-Com bubble in the 2000s. However, the main difference between the two eras is that most dot-com companies weren’t actually producing any real products or services. On the other hand, AI stocks have legitimate revenue-driving products. And, they have the ability to boost the productivity and efficiency of other strong existing businesses.\n\nSo are all AI stocks worth buying right now? Definitely not. In a bubble-like environment, many stocks will be overvalued. Currently, AI is the tide that is raising all boats.\n\nLet’s examine the three best AI stocks to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META)  In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is an American technology company that was founded by its current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg. It’ best known for apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, which have over 3.2 billion daily active users. In April, 55 of the 62 analyst recommendations were a buy or strong buy rating for the stock. The average price target is $480.13 with a street-high target of $552.50.\n\nAt the center of Meta’s AI research is its Llama 3 large language model. This is Meta’s answer to OpenAI’s GPT and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Gemini platform. The main difference is that Llama 3 is completely open-source and free for both commercial and personal users. As META moves to integrate its intelligent assistant into many of its products, investors should expect Meta’s market dominance to continue.\n\nAs for its financials, although Meta had a quick meltdown after its recent earnings, its recovery has swiftly been going underway. Shares are trading at a reasonable 8.3x sales and 22.8x forward earnings. Revenue-wise, Meta’s ten-year revenue CAGR of 32% puts it an edge above its peers like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nFounded in 2012, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is an American cloud-computing company. The stock held its IPO in September 2020 in what was one of the most anticipated debuts in Wall Street history. Even still, Snowflake has a ton of potential upside with a street-high price target of $600.00. Its average target of $219.71 represents a nearly 40% upside from its current price.\n\nSo how is Snowflake an AI stock? Snowflake’s data warehousing and analytics platform is essential to building AI solutions for specific companies and businesses. Think of it as a pick-and-shovel play for AI rather than a business that directly develops AI technology. Also, SNOW has become well known for its large language model called “Arctic”. It helps deliver enterprise solutions like coding and development with breakthrough efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, its stock has seen a sell-off resulting from a combination of a weak forecast and overall uncertainty surrounding its sudden change in CEO. At these depressed prices, shares are now trading at 18.6x sales, a historically cheap point for SNOW. Assuming a reversion to the mean, now is a great opportunity to take advantage of the recent negative sentiment around Snowflake.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020.

PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is an American data analytics firm that was founded in 2003 and specializes in empowering enterprises with its big data analytics. Wall Street analysts have a wide range of price targets for PLTR. These targets range from as low as $5.00 to as high as $35.00 with an average price target of $23.33.\n\nThis company is well known for its enterprise software platforms that help to digest and analyze large sets of data. Palantir recently partnered with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to provide AI solutions to both commercial and government clients. Moreover, CEO Alex Karp recently stated that demand for its AIP AI-based platform has been unprecedented. PLTR’s commitment to signing new contracts has helped it establish itself as an emerging leader in the AI data analytics sector. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Palantir’s valuation has always been the bear thesis for the stock. Even with the recent growth, shares trade at 24x sales and 75x forward earnings. Nonetheless, Palantir has finally become profitable and has seen a sharply rising revenue CAGR over the past three years. So, with its emergence as a major AI player, Palantir could be on the verge of a hyper-growth phase in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Must-Buy Stocks Buy Following Earnings",
        "content": "As earnings season begins to wind down, the standout performers are easier to identify. While some stocks posted adequate quarterly earnings, others really wowed Wall Street.\n\nThese exceptional performers not only exceeded expectations but also provided compelling outlooks, signaling strong potential for future growth.\n\nAs investors sift through the earnings reports to find winners, I must highlight three stocks that I have been impressed with and believe are poised for further upside potential.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nAmazon's AMZN recent earnings report painted a rosy picture, with profits exceeding expectations. The star of the show was their cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which saw significant growth fueled by the surging demand for AI capabilities. This strong performance in AWS underscores Amazon's prime position to capitalize on the booming AI market.\n\nAWS grew an impressive 17% YoY and brought in $25 billion in revenue for the quarter. Even more impressive was the $9.4 billion profit earned from the segment, demonstrating the huge margins the business enjoys.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Earnings estimates have been revised considerably higher over the last week and across timeframes. Furthermore, EPS are forecast to grow 29.6% annually, which is a very high pace of growth and among the highest of the mega-cap technology stocks. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCoinbase Global\n\nCoinbase Global COIN reported a stunning earnings beat last week, bringing in $4.40 of EPS, far exceeding analysts' expectations of $1.28. Revenue was 20% above estimates as well.\n\nMore than anything, Coinbase has a dominant role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, especially in the United States. As long as cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin especially remain in a bull market, Coinbase should be one of the primary beneficiaries.\n\nCoinbase Global currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflected by strongly upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings expectations have been unanimously upgraded by 250%-300%! Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCoinbase stock is also a powerful trading vehicle. The price action has regularly been consolidating and building out these descending wedges from which it breaks out aggressively from. If COIN stock can clear the $220 level it should make another attempt at its recent highs. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nTransdigm Group\n\nTransdigm Group TDG soared in its second quarter, exceeding analysts’ expectations. Revenue jumped 20.5%, driven by strong demand across their aerospace platforms. Net income also rose significantly, with earnings per share up over 32% year-over-year. This positive performance reflects the ongoing recovery in the commercial aerospace industry, and TransDigm is well-positioned to benefit from continued growth in passenger traffic.\n\nStory continues\n\nTransdigm also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nTransdigm Group is a lesser-followed stock that has consistently delivered exceptional long-term returns. As a leading manufacturer of aerospace components and systems, TransDigm specializes in producing highly engineered products for use in commercial and military aircraft.\n\nDespite flying under the radar for many investors, TransDigm's unique business model and focus on high-quality, proprietary products have contributed to its impressive track record of growth and profitability. Over the years, TransDigm has demonstrated its ability to generate strong cash flow and consistently outperform market expectations, making it a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the aerospace industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile there were a number of strong earnings reported this quarter, these three stocks really jumped out to me. Not only are all of them regular market outperformers but are further bolstered by the top Zacks Ranks.\n\nFor investors looking to add exposure following earnings, these are three worthy considerations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon unveils first electric seaport trucks amid push to slash tailpipe emissions",
        "content": "By Lisa Baertlein\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Amazon.com on Tuesday unveiled the first of a dozen Volvo electric big rigs it plans to deploy this year to pick up cargo from the nation's busiest container seaport in Southern California.\n\nThe e-commerce giant already has eight of those semi trucks in use at the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, where every so-called drayage truck must be zero-emissions by 2035.\n\nThe deployment is a first for Amazon, extending its vehicle electrification projects from ocean ports to customer doorsteps. The effort is vital to the company's push to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\n\nSo far, a little more than 1% of the 23,761 trucks that serve the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex are zero-emission vehicles - including 201 electric rigs, Long Beach port spokesman Lee Peterson said.\n\n\"Heavy-duty trucking is a particularly difficult area to decarbonize,\" said Udit Madan, Amazon's vice president of worldwide operations.\n\nThe company has rolled out more than 13,500 Rivian electric cargo delivery vans across the country since 2022. The transition to electric semi trucks will be a bigger lift, because they haul heavier loads and their batteries require more intensive charging infrastructure.\n\n\"There is no playbook,\" said Adam Baker, vice president of global logistics for Amazon. For now, the company is gathering data on battery performance that will help determine how many trucks will be needed.\n\nThe manufacturer of Amazon's electric drayage trucks will continue working with the company and JAB Hunt, which provides drivers for the rigs, throughout the deployment, said Keith Brandis, vice president of partnerships and system solutions at Volvo Trucks North America.\n\n\"Charging infrastructure is the long pole in the tent. We have to get that right,\" Brandis said.\n\nThe ports, private companies and truck owners are racing to build heavy-duty chargers to support the transition to zero-emissions vehicles.\n\nIn the near term, Amazon's electric port trucks will charge at an offsite facility operated by Forum Mobility, a startup that counts Amazon's Climate Pledge fund among its early investors.\n\nForum Mobility this week broke ground on a Port of Long Beach high-speed charging depot that can serve 44 trucks simultaneously. Amazon is the first customer for the site, which will also be open to other drayage truckers, Forum Mobility CEO Matt LeDucq said.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; editing by Deepa Babington and Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era",
        "content": "Dear fellow investors,\n\nAt the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) Annual Meeting we marked what we believe is the end of an era both for Berkshire and for the S&P 500 Index. In Berkshire's case it is the loss of Charlie Munger and the passing of the baton from Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) to his well-prepared team. In the case of the index it is the rhymes surrounding the past major peaks in stock market euphoria and what Munger and Buffett have said publicly.\n\nBuffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting over the weekend that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a great deal of good and a great deal of evil in the form of scamming. The video of Charlie saying that a euphoria episode is like a chain letter or a Ponzi scheme and when it gets combined with a legitimate development, like the internet, it is like combining raisins and turds. You still end up with turds! We believe that AI is a legitimate development, but it is coming at the late stages of the fourth euphoria episode of the last 100 years (1929, 1969, 1999 and 2021).\n\nAt Smead Capital Management, we believe investors are going to be extremely negatively impacted by the hangover from the euphoric emergence of AI. The reason lies in the historical behavior of the stock market in relation to major life-changing technology. History shows that the stock market benefits of technological advances come 10 years after the original excitement.\n\nRadio changed everyone's life between 1923 and 1941. One percent of U.S. households had a radio in 1923, and by 1937, that number grew to 75% household penetration. In 1941, the most famous radio address was conducted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He said, \"December 7, 1941, is a day that will live in infamy!\" The U.S. declared War against the Axis powers.\n\nRCA was the largest maker of radios, one of two large national radio broadcasters and one of two large radio content producers. As is the case for new technologies in the investing world, RCA saw a blistering gain between 1925 and 1929 in what is referred to as the Roaring 1920s: Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nHowever, from October 1929 to May 1941, you would've lost over 80% of your investment in RCA. Eventually, from 1941 to 1968, RCA was spectacular!\n\nMany new technologies were spurred forward by the space race from 1955 to 1969. Television's popularity exploded and business use of computers (IBM) contributed to a euphoric stock market era called the Go-Go 1960s. T. Rowe Price and Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) pivoted away from stocks by shifting to inflation hedges like oil, commodities and gold (Price) and giving his partners cash back in 1969 (Buffett). Buffett said in early 1969 that \"investors had moved from lethargy ten years before to acute hypertension at the end of 1968. This era ended on the two-year bull market led by 24 stocks in the two Nifty-Fifty lists at Morgan Guaranty and Kidder Peabody. Stocks didn't get attractive at the S&P 500 Index level until 1982. Here is how the market treated shares of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Coke (NYSE:KO) from the end of 1972 to the end of 1982:\n\nStory continues Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nJump ahead to the late 1990s euphoria related to the introduction of the internet and the mania tied to it which did change our lives. Tech stocks soared in 1998-1999, just like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has in the last two years. This was despite a severe Fed tightening cycle by then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan who could see that a financial euphoria episode had developed. He called it \"irrational exuberance in 1997! Like Charlie Munger just called it turds! Here is how Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002, as two of the most popular ways to participate in the legitimate development called the internet: Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nThis time, the stock market believes the AI phenomena will change our lives as it elongates the financial euphoria episode that Munger called, in November of 2021, \"the biggest euphoria episode of his career!\" Again, Munger had been through the Go-Go 1960s and the DotCom bubble. We are advising extreme caution for investors who fear stock market failure. This chart of low dividend stocks relative to high dividend stocks does a good job of showing where we are compared to 1969 and late 1999: Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nHere is why we are extremely cautious: Like the prior euphoria episodes, the AI craze has hit the stock market like wildfire. Investors feel like it is a train they must catch, even if it gets severely interrupted at some point. It is, as Munger says, \"a legitimate business development.\" However, it is coming toward the end of a massive euphoria episode in stocks that is strong enough to withstand a 500-basis point Federal Reserve tightening and a tech bear market in 2022. Therefore, the raisins of AI are intertwined with the financial euphoria turds!\n\nAs responsible fiduciaries and stock pickers, we must defend our capital until this euphoria gets purged through severe losses in the S&P 500 Index, which is \"all twisted up\" in the euphoria of this era. Join us in patiently waiting through the last phases of the euphoria and the bargains that we believe could be available to us as a result. Lastly, recognize that we are close to the end of an era.\n\nFear Stock Market Failure.\n\nThe information contained in this missive represents Smead Capital Management's opinions and should not be construed as personalized or individualized investment advice and are subject to change.

        "title": "The 3 Best Stocks to Buy to Survive the Coming Nasdaq 100 Crash",
        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 has been on a tear. The tech-heavy index is up 37% over the past 12 months compared to a 26% gain by the S&P 500 and a 17% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But what goes up must come down. And as any investor who remembers 2022 knows, the reversal can be quick and sharp. The Nasdaq 100 lost 33% of its value that year.\n\nOf course, the bull market ride since then has been phenomenal. Tech stocks have carried the index to a 63% gain, so there’s no reason to fear a market crash. It’s just the next phase before a new run higher that washes away all the pain of the downturn.\n\nBut if you want to survive a crash in fine form, the three companies below are Nasdaq 100 crash-resistant stocks that should protect your downside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.\n\nSource: Andrey Solovev / Shutterstock\n\nA market crash might impede Booking Holdings’ (NASDAQ:BKNG) growth trajectory as travel demand ebbed, but this global travel giant has geographic diversification that would minimize a full collapse.\n\nIn virtually every country around the world, Booking has developed a leading network of hotel properties and services. It has achieved a critical mass that attracts more travelers looking for rooms, rentals, attractions, flights, and a payment platform.\n\nBooking Holdings also possesses a first-mover status in certain regions, such as Asia, which gives it a competitive edge over rivals trying to break into these markets. In China, its partnerships with Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM), Meituan-Dianping (OTCMKTS:MPNGF) and ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing give it a leg up as does its own Agoda.com portal. It is difficult and expensive for rivals to build the same sort of network that Booking has established.\n\nWith an equally extensive relationship with proprietors in Europe, the online travel agent offers investors downside protection in case of a crash.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is finding its groove as data center demand for artificial intelligence (AI) creates a burgeoning market. While Marvell’s leadership in electro-optical chips will be its mainstay of growth and profitability, the chipmaker also opened up a new avenue for growth in custom accelerators.\n\nMarvell recently announced its third hyperscale cloud customer for its custom chip business. It proves the chipmaker’s pivot to data center infrastructure positions the company for long-term growth as the market has a runway for significant expansion. Wall Street believes Marvell has won Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google as customers. They are impressed with its ability to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and, of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in delivering superlative networking chip performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chipmaker forecasts AI revenue will double this year and then double for several years. It expects to generate $2.6 billion in AI sales by 2026. And because it offers a broad catalog of switches, processors and optical chips, Marvell Technology can arguably gain significant market share.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a Nasdaq 100 market crash, having Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in your portfolio would provide sufficient ballast to keep the whole thing afloat. As a cheap form of at-home entertainment, movie streaming can’t be beat. As one of the very few that has proved it can do so profitably, Netflix is quickly becoming one of the last-man-standing providers.\n\nThe market is already giving investors a bit of a discount on the stock after it knocked Netflix shares back 10% following earnings.\n\nAlthough the streamer added even more subscribers to the platform, its forecast for deceleration in the second half of 2024 caused the market to pause its incredible run-up. Over the past year, shares nearly doubled. The platform has over 81 million subscribers in North America, making it a very mature market that is not likely to see much more growth. That’s especially true after converting millions to paying members following a password-sharing crackdown. Still, there is plenty of growth available internationally.\n\nHowever, what the past four years have shown is that operating a streaming business is not as easy as Netflix made it look. Not even Disney (NYSE:DIS) has found the formula for making money at it, while Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is desperately seeking a buyer.\n\nNetflix is a solid business that has endured an onslaught of competition. Waiting them out was difficult but has paid off for Netflix and its shareholders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "First-quarter earnings continued to come in better than expected last week, but it was the latest Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting which led to a pop in markets in the second half of the week. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out a rate hike at the next meeting, downplayed stagflation concerns and announced the central bank would slow the pace of balance sheet reductions, a move widely seen as a slight easing of monetary policy.[1]\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SRE.\n\nRate cut hopes were raised even further on Friday when U.S. jobs data for April came in weaker than expected. Nonfarm Payrolls totaled 175,000, well below the Dow Jones consensus of 240,000. Unemployment, which has stayed consistently low, rose to 3.9%.[2] All major U.S. indices ended the day up 1 - 2% on the news.\n\nOn the earnings front, all eyes were on two more of the Magnificent 7 names, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Amazon surpassed both top and bottom-line expectations, driven by strength in ad revenue which increased 24% YoY, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) which grew 17%.[3] Apple was able to beat on earnings estimates, but missed on revenues as iPhone sales sunk 10% during the quarter.[4] Despite that disappointing result, which CEO Tim Cook blamed on difficult year-over-year comparisons, the tech behemoth showed there is no shortage of cash when they announced a $110 billion buyback, the largest-ever in history. The stock shot up 6% in after-hours trading.\n\nOn the flipside, there were some consumer-centric names that didn't fare well when they reported Q1 results last week. Results from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)[5], McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)[6] and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM)[7] all showed that U.S. consumers were starting to hold back on dining out. All three missed on bottom-line expectations, while only McDonald's squeaked by on the top line. Consumers have remained resilient in the face of higher prices in the last two years, but inflation may finally be taking its toll.\n\nWith 80% of S&P 500 names reporting thus far, year-over-year earnings growth stands at 5% according to data from FactSet.[8] That's with 77% of companies surpassing analyst expectations, above the 10-year average, on par with the five-year average and just a little lighter than the one-year average of 78%. Revenues are still light, with only 61% of companies beating on the top-line, showing that many names are continuing to cost-cut their way to profitability.\n\nOn deck the last peak week of the first-quarter season\n\nThis week we get a smattering of results from different sectors, with 3,507 companies expected to report in total, the most of any week this season. Popular names to watch include Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) on Monday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Tuesday and Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues The Final Peak Week of the 1st-Quarter Season Begins Just as Earnings Hit Their Stride\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[9]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their first-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Nine companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Loews Corp. (NYSE:L), Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE:WMB), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Assurant Inc. (NYSE:AIZ), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) and NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis week will mark the final peak week of the first-quarter earnings season with 3,507 companies set to report. May 9 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,236 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 42% of companies have reported (out of our universe of 10,000-plus global names).

        "title": "Tomorrow’s Winners: 3 EV Stocks to Buy Before the Market’s Massive Rebound",
        "content": "EV stocks have become a polarizing topic among investors. Some investors are convinced that EVs are the end-all-be-all of transportation for the future. On the other hand, some are doubtful of the true extent of EVs and still hold short-term sentiments against them. Nonetheless, EVs offer a way for the world to relinquish our reliance on fossil fuels finally. They are also the gateway to the intersection of computers and vehicles. For the EV industry, this often means robo taxis via autonomous driving technology or charging applications and digital services.\n\nHowever, as we have seen over the past year, interest rates, inflation and the overall macroeconomic environment heavily impact EV stocks. Additionally, pure-play EVs are consumer products and are still susceptible to the volatility of consumer trends. While all of this has contributed to the EV industry now being in a hull, here are three EV stocks to buy before the market makes its inevitable rebound.\n\nTesla (TSLA)  Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy. TSLA stock. stocks that could be the next Tesla\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) headlining this article should be no surprise to anyone researching the EV industry. It is currently the twelfth-largest company in the world by market cap. It remains a divisive stock on Wall Street, with analyst price targets ranging from $21.30 to $298.14. The current price of $181.19 is about 10% higher than the average price target of $167.09.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough it saw a bounce following its recent earnings call, Tesla remains the worst-performing mega-cap stock in 2024. CEO Elon Musk is seemingly going all in on the Cybercab autonomous taxi, which will be unveiled in August. It has also received preliminary approval to test its FSD technology in China, the largest automotive market in the world. To top off these potential catalysts, its mass-market Model 2 is also alleged to begin production in 2025. Now, investors are waiting for Tesla to execute these potential developments perfectly or risk losing further shareholder support.\n\nThe pullback has reduced the stock to trading at just 6.6x sales: one of the lowest multiples since it went public. Yet, despite all the headlines about declining margins and sales, Tesla’s 10-year revenue CAGR is still sitting at 47%. While this stock does have its fair share of risks, it’s now or never to buy the dip of Tesla before it hits another hyper-growth cycle over the next few years.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) is an American EV maker that has found its niche in the EV market with electric SUVs and pickup trucks. Large companies, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and AT&T (NYSE:T), rely on its distribution of electric vans for deliveries and customer service. Yahoo Finance analysts project a one-year price range between $9 to $36, and the median analyst target of $16.84 indicates some potential upside for Rivian.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince Rivian went public in November 2021, it has met with unfair expectations and comparisons with Tesla. The stock went parabolic after its IPO but has lost more than 90% of its price. Nonetheless, Rivian is currently focusing on its long-awaited mass-market vehicle models: the R2, the R3 and the R3X. These will go head-to-head with Tesla’s Model Y when released in 2026.\n\nAs expected, Rivian is trading at its lowest-ever price multiple at just 2.1x sales. In the same quarter in 2023, RIVN was trading at 8.5x sales. As new models hit 2026 and Rivian works to continue reducing its losses and increasing its sales, the risk-reward to the upside couldn’t be clearer at this rock-bottom price.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a leading EV maker selling premium smart electric vehicles in China’s growing energy vehicle market. Wall Street analysts project a one-year price target range of $25 and $68. The average price target of $47.98 is nearly 40% higher than the current price.\n\nThis stock is often grouped with other Chinese EV makers like XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Nio (NYSE:NIO). The difference is that Li has been profitable this year and focuses on EVs and electric hybrids. Its EREV technology allows some of its vehicles to have a range of more than 800 miles per charge. On top of that, Li has higher gross margins than even Tesla.\n\nLike Tesla and Rivian, Li trades at its lowest price multiples as a public company. Shares are currently trading at 1.7x sales and 20x forward earnings. Given that the EV sector is mainly centered around China, Li Auto sets itself apart as a more unknown company to U.S. investors with the opportunity to become one of the biggest players.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Rivian Q1 preview: Profit path, margins, and vehicle roadmap in focus",
        "content": "Rivian (RIVN) will give investors a crucial first quarter update on its financials as the pure-play adventure EV maker attempts to turn the tide from losses to profit this year.\n\nIn the first quarter Rivian revealed its upcoming R2 mid-size EV and strong Q1 sales, but also announced job cuts and a pause in the development of its Georgia plant. The company also received a financial boon from the state of Illinois: an $827 million incentive package to expand its facility in the city of Normal.\n\nConserving cash while still developing its new vehicles (and retooling its existing Normal plant) is of paramount concern for investors as 2024 progresses.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian is expected to report revenue of $1.175 billion, a massive 78% jump from a year ago. The revenue bump will not translate into profit yet, with the company expected to report an adjusted loss of $1.15 per share, with an adjusted net income loss of $1.129 billion. Operating profit is expected to come in slightly worse, with a $1.299 billion loss, along with EBITDA of negative $856.6 million.\n\nLast month the company did, however, report first quarter R1T and R1S production of 13,980 and deliveries of 13,588, topping expectations of around 12,400 units. The company also reaffirmed production guidance of 57,000 vehicles in 2024.\n\nInvestors will also be looking for any updates on Rivian’s full-year profitability metrics. Rivian previously said it sees an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.70 billion for 2024, with capital expenditure outlays hitting $1.75 billion.\n\nPart of bringing down those costs came in the form of a 10% salaried staff reduction, with the company citing economic uncertainty. During its Q4 earnings report, Rivian reiterated its forecast to reach “modest gross profit” by the end of 2024. CFO Claire McDonough noted that the company was \"very close\" to achieving a positive contribution margin at the end of 2023.\n\nIn terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it had $7.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q4, down from the $9.1 billion it had at the end of Q3.\n\nR2 and future vehicles Founder and CEO of Rivian RJ Scaringe speaks onstage during the Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nIn March at an event in Laguna Beach, Calif., Rivian unveiled its smaller, less expensive electric R2 SUV, which is expected to arrive in 2026. In a surprise announcement, the company also revealed smaller R3 crossovers, which gave the stock a boost, though shares are still down a whopping 55% year to date.\n\nRivian also said it will produce the R2 at its existing US factory instead of its upcoming Georgia factory, saving the company more than $2 billion. Rivian said its Georgia factory development is suspended at the moment, though Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe reaffirmed the company wasn’t abandoning the project.\n\nStory continues\n\nScaringe said once the R2 was ready for a larger rollout, the upcoming Georgia facility would handle the rollout. The company also said it would be launching its R2 in Europe, which would be a huge market for the company as it's not currently selling its larger R1 vehicles on the continent.

(Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nWall Street is still skeptical of the Rivian profitability story, even with the wider appeal of the R2.\n\n“In our view, the path to R2 profitability would also be harder to believe if the company cannot deliver gross margin positive on R1,” Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner wrote following the R2’s reveal.\n\n“Furthermore, with R2 priced starting $45k and directly competing with Tesla’s Model Y (priced at $44k for the lowest trim), we wonder how Rivian will be able to achieve positive margin with much more content, and more limited scale vs. Tesla who has world-class sourcing conditions,” he said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. If you want to skip the industry outlook and check out more stocks in this selection, see 5 Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn the fast-paced world where convenience and speed are essential, the delivery sector has become increasingly important. The sector covers a wide range of companies. This includes those offering traditional courier services and those innovating in the areas of drone delivery and advanced logistics solutions. These companies are essential in bridging the gap between merchants and consumers.\n\nThe rise in demand for delivery services is tied to the rise in global e-commerce. According to an analysis by environmental group Stand.earth, global e-commerce is expected to expand at a rate more than double that of in-store purchases. By the end of this decade, 25,000 packages are expected to be dispatched every second. The rise in global e-commerce has also caused a change in people's buying patterns around the world. Americans now do more than 15% of their shopping on online platforms, which amounts to a staggering value of about $1 trillion annually.\n\nCOVID-19 accelerated the shift towards online shopping and heightened expectations for fast, reliable delivery services. This shift is not merely a temporary adjustment. It marks a long-term change in consumer behavior, underscoring the importance of robust delivery systems. The food delivery sector, in particular, is witnessing robust growth. The global online food delivery is forecasted to reach $1.79 trillion in revenues by 2028. In the U.S and China, the grocery delivery niche is expected to outperform. The fast growth of the grocery delivery niche indicates a lasting change in consumer behavior, which is shifting to more convenient methods.\n\nRapid Delivery Comes at a Cost to the Planet\n\nAlthough the demand for fast delivery is rising globally. This is having a substantial negative impact on the planet. The demand for quick package delivery has significantly impacted the environment. Major delivery companies like FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), and DHL emitted 92 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2022, exceeding the entire carbon footprint of countries like Greece. Despite the apparent need for more environmentally friendly operations, these companies have slowly adopted electric vehicles. Some have even scaled back their climate pledges amid a global delivery surge. Several factors contribute to this reluctance. These include the high initial expenses of electric trucks and the extensive and substantial costs of upgrading charging infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nProgress in electrifying delivery fleets has been mixed. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and DHL have made notable strides in deploying electric trucks in the US and Europe, respectively. The overall industry efforts fall behind the rising emissions caused by increased delivery volumes. Companies point to financial sustainability, significant capital investment requirements, and the current insufficiency of charging infrastructure as major obstacles to the faster adoption of electric vehicles. Pressure from both local and global regulations is increasing. Consumer demand for greener options is also growing, emphasizing the urgent need for the delivery industry to expedite its transition to electric fleets.\n\nIn 2024, delivery companies have performed been performing well. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), a key player in the delivery sector, has delivered exceptional returns to investors. This mirrors the broader trend in the market. Service-oriented companies, especially those in the delivery sector, have continued to gain investor interest due to changing consumer behaviors and the increased reliance on delivery services.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\nA higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 States with the Largest Oil Reserves in the US 20 Most Diverse Countries in Asia 15 Best Places to Retire in Georgia\n\nDisclosure.None. 11 Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Fundswas initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments.\n\nTom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented:\n\n“A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.”\n\nCurrently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the \"size effect\". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs.\n\nSome of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of May 3, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\nA close-up image of a stock market graph displaying the growth of the company's mutual funds.\n\nBest Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\n12. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 69.29%\n\nFirst Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) aims to mirror the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Growth Index. It seeks to achieve similar investment outcomes in terms of both price and yield, excluding fees and expenses. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)’s net expense ratio stands at 0.60% as of December 1, 2023. As of May 2, 2024, the fund’s net assets exceed $1 billion, and its portfolio comprises 187 holdings, excluding cash. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to monitor.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is one of the top holdings of First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC). According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds held stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with a stake worth $1.88 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a popular stock among elite hedge funds.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top Q1 contributors were Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), Shockwave Medical and Spotify. Chipotle’s combination of superior quality and speed of service has created a strong brand affinity, and the company is currently expanding its store count at a growth rate of 8%–10% annually. With each restaurant generating an annual income of around 60% of its original investment cost, the implied payback period is less than two years. Given these attractive economics, we believe a long runway remains for market penetration potential. Next, increased accessibility and convenience have been a strategic priority, leading it to add secondary “make lines” that enable each store to meet increased demand from third-party delivery services and the company’s own digital pickup lanes (“Chipotlanes”). And last, evidence is emerging that the company’s post-COVID training initiatives (“the four pillars of throughput”) are resulting in higher peak-time productivity. Overall, the profit cycle remains nicely in motion, and the stock remains a large CropSM holding.”\n\n11. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 81.23%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 11th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) aims to replicate the performance of S&P 900 Growth Index, which consists of large and mid-cap US stocks known for their growth potential.

According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was found in 302 hedge fund portfolios, with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust holding the biggest stake in the company, comprising 38.2 million shares worth $14.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds best-in-class platforms and provides services that help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft’s stock appreciated based on excitement surrounding the company’s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI, which will be through both Azure and Microsoft Copilot, the company’s new GenAI personal assistant.”\n\n10. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 82.91%\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is placed 10th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) seeks to replicate the performance of S&P 500(R) Growth Index, which is composed of large-cap US stocks known for their growth potential. The ETF was launched on May 22, 2000. Its net assets amounted to $42.8 billion as of May 2, 2024. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)’s portfolio comprises 228 holdings, along with an expense ratio of 0.18%.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd in the portfolio of iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW). Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database reveals that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of 131 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 134 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.56 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a global consumer electronics and software company that designs and markets mobile communications devices (iPhones), personal computers (Macs), multi-purpose tablets (iPads), and wearables (Apple Watch, AirPods, and Accessories). The company also sells several high-margin consumer services including Advertising, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content and Payment Services. The stock’s underperformance during the quarter was due to fears that the company’s slowing top-line growth and increased competitive threats make the stock’s premium valuation harder to justify.”\n\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 83.73%\n\nVanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) invests in stocks from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Growth Index.

As of March 31, 2024, VOOG’s net assets came in at $10.3 billion.\n\nSemiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top holdings of Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG). As per Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was found in 173 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 180 in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is one of the largest stakeholders of NVIDIA, with 13.90 million shares worth $6.88 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\n8. iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 92.31%\n\niShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG) seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Growth Index, consisting of US equities with growth traits from both large and mid-cap categories. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. As of May 2, 2024, iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s net assets came exceeded $2 billion. The fund features an expense ratio of 0.04% and a portfolio comprising 392 holdings.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 4th in iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s portfolio.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 41.78 million shares worth $6.34 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.”\n\n7. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 94.88%\n\nFidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) strives to mirror the price and yield performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a weighted index reflecting the market capitalization of stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs, ranking 7th on our list. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) was launched on September 9, 2003. As of March 31, 2024, the fund holds $6.08 billion in portfolio assets, while featuring a portfolio comprising 1,006 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.21%.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is one of the key stakeholders of the company, with 7.46 million shares worth $2.6 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\n6. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 100.46%\n\nNuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) ranks 6th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) follows a passive management strategy, investing primarily in large-cap US equity securities displaying growth characteristics and meeting required environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. It aims to replicate the investment outcomes of the TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index, excluding fees and expenses. The fund was launched on December 16, 2016. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) features an expense ratio of 0.26% and holds $1.3 billion in net assets as of May 2, 2024.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the largest holdings of Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was part of 166 hedge fund portfolios at the conclusion of December 2023, up from 163 in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of Alphabet, with a position worth $2.9 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top growth plays on the radar of smart investors.\n\nPalm Valley Capital Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Governments have various irons in the fire for curbing (commandeering?) the power of tech titans, with the European Union rolling out the Digital Markets Act, the Federal Trade Commission suing Amazon for illegally using monopoly power, and the DOJ lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s advertising business going to trial in September.\n\nFurthermore, the dominant technology enterprises are not immune from shooting themselves in the foot. Google’s botched launch of its AI model, Gemini, shows the risk of having too much money. You lose discipline. A Pirate Wires exposé into the firm’s culture revealed that employees went to extreme lengths to intentionally degrade the quality of the AI engine’s output for ideological reasons.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best investments for beginners in 2024. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024.\n\nWith the first quarter of 2024 now concluded, the stock market has evolved. Continuing trends from Q4 2023, the period witnessed the sustained growth of artificial intelligence and technology stocks, with investors remaining optimistic about AI's potential across consumer and business applications, alongside expectations of multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year. However, as we move into the second quarter of the year, investor sentiment has shifted from anticipating a strong economic environment to reassessing strategies for allocating significant funds into the stock market.\n\nIn April, U.S. job growth decelerated more than anticipated, with the annual wage increase dipping below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, according to the Labor Department's latest employment report released on April 3. The unemployment rate also rose slightly to 3.9% from March's 3.8%, attributed to a growing labor supply. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 175,000 jobs last month, marking the lowest increase in six months, with revisions revealing 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than initially reported. Despite these figures, the jobless rate persisted below 4% for the 27th consecutive month.\n\nThe signs of a cooling labor market sparked optimism that the U.S. central bank could orchestrate a \"soft landing\" for the economy, dispelling concerns of stagflation, which had been fueled by reports of subdued economic growth and elevated inflation in the first quarter. In that regard, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her readiness to raise the policy rate if progress stalls or reverses, while expressing confidence that inflation will continue to decline even as the central bank maintains its benchmark interest rate at current levels:\n\n\"My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed.\"\n\nAlthough inflation has decreased from its peak in mid-2022, it remains significantly above the central bank's target range. Most reports this year have indicated an annual inflation rate of around 3%, with the Fed's preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, recently standing at 2.8%. Rising prices have led to upward pressure on wages, contributing to an inflationary environment that has prevented the Fed from taking aggressive steps to cut interest rates, despite market expectations suggesting otherwise.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're a beginner in the world of investments and finance, diving right in can seem daunting with everything mentioned above. However, there are strategies to simplify the process and increase your chances of success. One approach is to focus on established, well-known companies with strong financial foundations.

Subsequently, we sorted these companies by market capitalization to prioritize the largest ones. Our selection criteria focused on stocks suitable for beginners, considering both revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The resulting list is arranged in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 18.17%\n\nBased in New York, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(NYSE:JPM) performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.”\n\nMuch like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) ranks as one of the best investments for beginners.\n\n11. Adobe Inc.

Nearly all of the Company’s N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity.”\n\n9.

        "content": "Tech conglomerate Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to ride a wave of positive momentum, both in the long and short term.\n\nIn the long term, the significant growth and profitability of the Cloud segment shows promising signs to catch up to larger rivals, along with the company's leading position in search allowing it to capitalize on new developments from the investments made into generative artificial intelligence.\n\nIn the short term, a series of potential catalysts include the upcoming company events to showcase AI capabilities (Google I/O), potential for Gemini image relaunch that could help with sentiment on Google's AI capabilities, the revenue potential from Shorts monetization and the ongoing operating model optimization and reprioritization.\n\nThis analysis will delve into the long-term and short-term catalysts that could potentially fuel Alphabet's momentum, as well as my forward views on these factors. But first and foremost, let's dive into the company's outstanding performance recorded in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings update\n\nRevenue overview Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet significantly exceeded expectations, surpassing consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. According to Factset data, the company exceeded revenue estimates by approximately $1 billion. The company achieved $80.50 billion in sales, representing a significant 15.40% year-over-year increase. The figure above illustrates this revenue growth was driven by notable advancements in YouTube ads (up 20.90% year over year), Google Search (up 14.40%) and Google Cloud (up 28.40%).\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet outperformed consensus expectations in terms of profitability, with an operating margin of 31.60% (a 667 basis point increase from a year ago). More notably, its Google cloud operating margins took a wild upturn delivering a margin of 9.40% (up 683 basis points). The company's operating income for the quarter amounted to $25.50 billion, reflecting a substantial 32% increase compared to the same period in 2023. On that note, the expansion in profitability can be attributed to better operating leverage as the higher top line was met with flattish operating costs. Alphabet's earnings per share performance showed remarkable growth as it reported a substantial rise in net income to $23.70 billion (up 57.20%), equating to $1.89 (versus $1.17 last year) diluted net income per share surpassing consensus estimates by a wide margin.\n\nNet income overview Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's capital return potential\n\nA key upside of owning Alphabet lies in its ability to provide significant returns to shareholders through its substantial available free cash flow. In the first quarter alone, it generated free cash flow of $16.80 billion (down 2.20% year over year). Capitalizing on this substantial free cash flow, the management made a historic announcement of a 20 cents cash dividend, scheduled to be paid on June 17. Moreover, the cash dividend is in addition to Alphabet's declaration of a $70 billion share repurchase program, which will further contribute to returning substantial amounts of cash to shareholders. Even before this announcement, Alphabet had been returning capital to its shareholder evident from its repurchase of $15.70 billion worth of its own shares in the first quarter of 2024 alone resulting in an impressive 93% cash flow return percentage.\n\nIn light of the introduction of both the dividend and share repurchase programs, I expect Alphabet to attract a growing number of investors, consequently driving its value upward in the medium to long term.\n\nLong-term catalyst one: Cloud business\n\nKnown for its pioneering search engine, Alphabet has evolved into a multi-faceted entity encompassing a vast array of products and services spanning from cloud computing and advertising to hardware and artificial intelligence. Amidst this dynamic landscape, the company has shown an excellent trajectory of growth and innovation (evident by its exceptional revenue growth record [compound annual growth rate of 18.50% from 2017 to 2023]). With this, Alphabet derives a lion's share of its revenue from its advertising segment, but with the increasing share of the cloud segment in Google's revenue, it is bringing some much-needed diversity to the revenue mix.\n\nRevenue mix 2017 versus 2023 Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nAlthough the Google Cloud segment is consistently increasing its revenue share (Cloud revenues has grown at a CAGR of 41.90% from 2017 to 2023) while also being consistently profitable, it still lags behind larger rivals. According to CRN.com, Google Cloud generated almost three times less than Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud businesses. But this segment is showing significant promise, with it now being consistently profitable and continuing to grow at a very healthy rate (recorded positive operation margin in 2023 of 5.20% [9.4% in first-quarter 2024]), but is still low compared to Amazon at 26% and Microsoft at 44%. As the segment expands in the long term, Google Cloud's operating margin is to improve as well. However, I also expect Alphabet will continue to make significant investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities arising from the shift toward cloud-based solutions. Consequently, the margins are expected to remain below those of competitors like Amazon and Microsoft, despite steady improvements.\n\nGoogle Cloud business operating performance (2018 to 2023) Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nGiven the widespread shift to cloud-based solutions, I am optimistic about the market's size and rapid growth, enabling all three players (Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet) to achieve success over the next few years. Google, with its strategic dedication, technological expertise and financial capabilities, is well positioned to continue gaining market share. Nonetheless, capitalizing on the growing market will involve substantial investment, potentially causing Google Cloud's profitability to lag behind that of its peers.\n\nCloud Infrastructure market share as of fourth-quarter 2023 Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Statista\n\nLong-term catalyst two: Generative AI and large language models\n\nThe generative AI space as a whole has immense potential for revolutionizing various industries from entertainment to health care and beyond with its applications being vast and continually expanding. However, several concerns have been raised with regard to the potential impact on Alphabet's leading position in search with the latest developments in the space by competitors like Microsoft (OpenAI), as gen AI technologies usher in the development of more sophisticated and interactive consumer tools, potentially challenging its standing. However, I believe Alphabet's strong position in both the gen AI and search spaces will be unchanged due to the promising development of products.\n\nAlphabet has continued to dedicate significant resources to its investments in gen AI and has done so for several years. I expect its abilities to expand as it continues to invest heavily over the next few years as well. Alphabet has its own products, like Bard, that I expect to evolve and improve due to ongoing investments that will allow the company to maintain its strong position in search and the broader digital advertising market.\n\nI believe Google is way ahead in the AI race with its leading position stemming from three main factors. First, its extensive volume of research is unparalleled, with 183 papers accepted in 2023 alone, nearly three times more than its closest competitor. Second, Google possesses unparalleled access to vast amounts of data thanks to its 16 services boasting over half a billion daily active users. Finally, Google's robust infrastructure enables it to effectively train and deploy AI models to a wide audience, leveraging its immense reach.\n\nRecently, Alphabet's Gemini Pro 1.5 its most advanced large language model was released to the general public, with a free tier limited to 50 requests a day. The Gemini Pro 1.5 is a multimodal system meaning it is able to process image, audio and video inputs, in addition to text inputs (OpenAI's latest version of GPT-4 is currently only able to process text and image inputs).\n\nShort-term catalysts\n\nApart from the aforementioned long-term catalysts, my optimistic outlook on the company in the short term is derived from several other catalysts, including:\n\nGoogle I/O Event Scheduled for May 14, this annual event is anticipated to introduce new AI integrations across various Google products such as Search, Maps, Android, Cloud and Google Workspace.\n\nGemini image generation relaunch Expected to relaunch in the second quarter, Google is set to introduce an upgraded version of Gemini image generation. This relaunch may involve a gradual rollout, initially granting access to developers or beta testers for human oversight and feedback. The focus may initially target specific use cases like generating product mockups and illustrations for advertisers, which may boost investor sentiment on Gemini.\n\nShorts monetization and YouTube revenue Short-form videos are driving engagement and revenue growth on social media platforms, including YouTube. As Shorts monetization catches up in 2024, we anticipate accelerating revenue growth on YouTube, which could positively impact Alphabet's overall revenue growth trajectory.\n\nOperating model optimization and reprioritization- Over the past few years, management has placed significant emphasis on the development of innovative new features, all while maintaining a firm grip on cost control. This strategic approach clearly indicates management's strong commitment to achieving a more sustainable operating model that will enhance profitability. Recently, Alphabet has outlined its plans to improve expense efficiency by 2024, which may involve restructuring efforts aimed at reducing both headcount and operational expenses, thereby driving margin expansion. An internal memo from Alphabet's CEO has also informed employees to anticipate further layoffs in 2024, following the previous layoffs in the ad sales unit. These actions underscore the company's ongoing efforts to reassess priorities and invest in its most critical areas.\n\nThoughts on valuation\n\nUsing a discounted cash flow model to assess Alphabet's value over a five-year growth period, a fair price of around $188 per share is projected, representing a roughly 10% increase from current levels on the basis cash flows are anticipated to grow from a forecasted $70 billion in 2024 to $130.50 billion by 2028, with a compounded annual growth rate of 13.30%. These estimates seem plausible given the positive growth drivers identified previously, suggesting potential upside in the company's growth trajectory. As Alphabet solidifies its core businesses and continues to innovate with AI tools to reinforce its position in search, there is room for significant upside beyond investor expectations. Extending the growth horizon to 10 years, a fair value of approximately $241 per share is projected, marking a roughly 40% increase from current levels, further highlighting Alphabet's growth potential.\n\nDespite various bearish arguments against Alphabet, there are no evident flaws or indications of these concerns in its financials. Throughout its history, the company has been a driving force of innovation and now, as a formidable and influential entity, it can innovate on a grander scale with substantial upfront investments while also generously rewarding shareholders. While many large tech companies appear to be thriving presently, the crucial aspect is their trajectory over the next five to 10 years. Given Google's immense scale, I am confident it will only continue to ascend from its current position.\n\nDiscounted cash flow analysis five-year growth exit Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: valueinvesting.io\n\nWrapping up\n\nIn conclusion, Alphabet stands poised to capitalize on a multitude of catalysts both in the long and short term. The company's robust growth trajectory in the cloud segment, coupled with its pioneering advancements in generative AI, positions it favorably to maintain and expand its market dominance. Short-term catalysts, including upcoming events showcasing AI capabilities and product relaunches, add further momentum to Alphabet's growth story. With a strategic focus on operational efficiency and innovation, Alphabet is primed to deliver significant upside potential for investors in the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence Stock That Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia 1 Year From Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) race is on, and it has a wide reach.\n\nSoftware companies (like Palantir Technologies and CrowdStrike) are developing programs that use AI to analyze data, solve complex problems, and provide cybersecurity. Hardware companies create high-powered semiconductors critical for data centers. Nvidia is the current titan. True \"picks-and-shovels\" companies like Marvell Technology make Ethernet switches and accelerators. Cloud providers, like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) benefit from the immense data needs AI creates. And even technology consulting experts like Accenture get a piece of the pie, helping other businesses make the most of their AI tools.\n\nNvidia is the talk of the town as the stock has enjoyed an incredible rise, about 220% over the last year and 440% over three years. As shown below, the market cap eclipsed $2 trillion and overtook Amazon for the first time in more than 20 years. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\nBut this may not last long; here are two huge reasons why.\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\nFew companies provide the massive cloud services necessary to run AI programs requiring enormous data resources. The \"big two\" are Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, with AWS being the world leader at about a third of the global market. Many investors soured on Amazon stock because of AWS in 2022 and 2023, but it is always darkest before the dawn.\n\nAWS drew criticism in 2023 when its formerly rampant growth plummeted, but I have been arguing that investors should wait until companies update their data usage budgets in 2024 before jumping to conclusions. Companies typically budget their resources before the start of a new year. Heading into 2023, most were battening down the hatches for a recession.\n\nAmazon knew budgets were tight, so it assisted customers by helping them lessen usage or move to less expensive plans. The company knew keeping long-term customers happy was more important than making a couple of extra bucks that year. In 2024, it is a different story.\n\nThe recession talk is primarily gone; AI is now center stage, and the same customers are now clamoring to leverage it. AI and larger data budgets fueled AWS and Amazon's earnings beat in the first quarter. AWS sales grew 17% year over year in Q1 to $25 billion, compared to 13% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAll the rest\n\nAWS stirs the drink, but the other two segments, North America and international, also had strong quarters with sales of $86 billion (12% growth) and $32 billion (10% growth), respectively. More importantly, consumer spending shows few signs of slowing, unemployment is low, and a recession doesn't seem imminent anymore.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne revenue stream that I particularly like is advertising. As you can see below, advertising has become a cash cow in recent years. Data source: Amazon. Chart by the author.\n\nThis lucrative revenue stream should also benefit from companies loosening their budgets. Amazon's ad business is popular because it targets consumers who are already looking to buy. Using Amazon's product placement, featured brands, and pay-per-click ad-buying functions are great ways to outrun the competition.\n\nFinally, back to AI. Amazon has several irons in the fire. One of these is Amazon Bedrock. Bedrock provides foundation models (FMs) from multiple vendors for customers to customize to their needs.

        "title": "3 AI Titans Betting Big on Anthropic’s Claude",
        "content": "It’s no longer just about OpenAI or ChatGPT.\n\nWe now have the the rise of powerful rivals in the large language model (LLM) scene. Some of the most capable LLMs are backed by massive technology sector heavyweights. Anthropic AI and its Claude model have been a hot place in which companies want to invest.\n\nAnd though retail investors can’t bet on the firm through public markets yet, the firms that have taken a stake are worth a look. This is especially true if they decide to embed some Claude AI features into their applications, similar to what Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has done with ChatGPT.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow that Microsoft has such a big stake in OpenAI, all eyes are on the next best invention within the private markets. For now, it seems to be Anthropic, a relatively small AI firm behind Claude that was founded by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei.\n\nLet’s explore three mega-cap Anthropic investors that are becoming difficult to ignore. They are gearing up to power forward with their AI strategies to meet (and perhaps exceed down the line) that of Microsoft.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) increased its stake in the company by $2.75 billion back in March 2024, bringing its total stake to $4 billion.\n\nWith its robust Bedrock AI service and the recently revealed Amazon Q AI-powered assistant, Amazon stands out as one of the more magnificent AI plays of the Magnificent Seven right now. When it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company wants to allocate a massive 80% chunk of its Global Summit event to be all about generative AI. Amazon isn’t simply content with catching up on AI. It wants to pull full steam ahead.\n\nHowever, at 52.1x trailing price-to-earnings, AMZN stock will not come cheap, as it plans to invest heavily in the future of AI.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) has a relatively small stake in Anthropic through its Generative AI fund. At this juncture, it’s the amount of the stake is unclear. However, the fact that it’s an early investor is notable.\n\nThe stake represents a portion of the $500 million being set aside for investment in “responsible generative AI” companies. Other holdings within the AI fund include Canada’s Cohere and Hearth.AI. Indeed, it’s a fund full of disruptive potential.\n\nApart from the fund, which I think Salesforce should increase the budget for (again), Salesforce has also been organically innovating on AI. With AI Copilot for Sales, Einstein Copilot, and Slack AI, Salesforce is a serious frontrunner.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter pulling back around 14% from its recent high, investors may be able to snag CRM stock at a discount relative to its growth.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another established mega-cap tech titan that’s hopped aboard the Anthropic AI bandwagon. Reportedly, the firm has a $2.55 billion stake in the Claude-owner after its latest $2 billion investment. Indeed, Google seems to be clashing with Amazon for a larger piece of the red-hot private AI innovator.\n\nLike Amazon, Alphabet has its own AI innovations and language models. With Gemini, Google already has one of the more popular models. As it integrates it with its suite of applications, chances are that Gemini could be the AI model to beat.\n\nTherefore, Google’s Anthropic bet seems to be a smart way to grab a bigger slice of the LLM market. Indeed, Gemini and Claude are rivals that can both excel as the AI boom heats up. Also, if Gemini falls flat and Claude thrives, Google’s Claude bet can act as a hedge. Either way, Alphabet stock looks way too cheap, given its impressive one-two combo.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Alphabet (Class C), Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.

        "title": "3 Consumer Staples Stocks to Sell in May Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "If you’re wondering which consumer staples stocks to sell this month, look no further. The consumer is hanging tough. Despite persistent inflation and elevated interest rates, Americans are continuing to spend. The Commerce Department recently reported that retail sales in March rose 0.7%. Data for February reflects 0.9% growth, which was the biggest gain in more than a year, and higher than an initial estimate of 0.6%. Economists polled by the Reuters news agency had forecast that April retail sales would increase 0.3%. On a year-over-year (YOY) basis, March retail sales were 4% higher.\n\nWhile the continued spending on everything from clothing and groceries to new vehicles and travel is good news for the economy, the data is starting to show some behavioral changes among people. Businesses report that consumers are seeking out cheaper generic alternatives to their name brand products, and the latest Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) credit card data shows that lower-income spending is outpacing spending by more affluent Americans as the wealthy tighten their purse strings.\n\nShould consumer spending falter in coming months, it would be bad news for the economy and could roil the stock market. Here are three consumer staples stocks to sell in May before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConsumer Staples Stocks to Sell: Unilever (UL) The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nSource: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish consumer goods company Unilever (NYSE:UL) is the company behind consumer products ranging from Dove soap and Axe body spray to Degree deodorant and Vaseline. The company also makes some limited food items such as Hellman’s mayonnaise and Knorr bullion cubes. Unilever and its stock have struggled mightily for many years now with the share price down 14% over the last five years. This has led to the decision to spin-off Unilever’s ice cream unit that includes brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Magnum.\n\nThe company said that the separation of its ice cream division, arguably its most popular business unit, is part of a broad restructuring that will see the company cut 7,500 jobs and achieve cost savings of more than $850 million. Going forward, Unilever will be restructured into four business units: beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, and nutrition. Management says that its ice cream unit, which generated $8.57 billion in revenue in 2023, will perform better as a standalone business. Analysts seem skeptical.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance’s (NASDAQ:WBA) latest earnings report contained some encouraging signs. But the company is by no means out of the woods. This is, after all, a company that was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the subpar performance of its stock. Year-to-date, WBA stock is down 33%. The company’s share price today is 66% lower than five years ago. Walgreens most recently lowered its profit outlook for the year as it grapples with a “challenging economy.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens has struggled with slumping demand for Covid-19 medications, low pharmacy reimbursement rates, and a failed push into healthcare services. New CEO Tim Wentworth has undertaken an aggressive cost reduction program, announcing in January that he was cutting the dividend payment by nearly 50%.The question is: will it be enough to turn Walgreens around. WBA stock was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year and replaced by e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) continues to struggle as consumers switch to lower priced generic versions of its products, a move being taken in response to the company raising prices. PG stock recently fell after the company behind Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razor blades reported mixed first-quarter financial results that showed its sales missed Wall Street’s target. Management has said repeatedly that price increases prompted by inflation are pushing consumers to cheaper generic products.\n\nIn its Q1 print, Procter & Gamble announced EPS of $1.52 versus analysts forecasts of $1.41. Revenue totaled $20.2 billion, which was below forecasts of $20.41 billion. Sales were up a slight 1% from a year earlier. The company reported overall flat sales volumes for Q1, while the average prices across its product categories rose 3%. Company executives warn that challenges may persist if inflation remains sticky, requiring continued price hikes.\n\nPG stock is up 5% over the last 12 months, missing out on most of the bull market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Zacks.com featured highlights include Amazon, NVIDIA, Zscaler, Alaska Air and DocuSign",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 7, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Amazon.com AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS, Alaska Air Group ALK and DocuSign DOCU.\n\nPlay Likely Earnings Beats with These 5 Top-Ranked Stocks\n\nIt is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality.\n\nIn this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Amazon.com, NVIDIA, Zscaler,Alaska Air Group and DocuSign as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.\n\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\n\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\n\nHow to Find Stocks That Can Beat\n\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\n\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\n\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only nine.\n\nHere are five out of nine stocks:\n\nAmazon.com: The Zacks Rank #2 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by its massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. The average earnings surprise of AMZN for the past four quarters is 48.17%.\n\nNVIDIA: The Zacks Rank #2 company is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.\n\nOver the years, NVIDIA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. The average earnings surprise of NVDA for the past four quarters is 20.18%.\n\nZscaler: The company is one of the world’s leading providers of cloud-based security solutions. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nZscaler offers a full range of enterprise network security services, including web security, Internet security, antivirus, vulnerability management, firewalls, and control over user activity in mobile, cloud computing, and Internet of things environments. The average earnings surprise of ZS for the past four quarters is 28.17%.\n\nAlaska Air Group: The Zacks Rank #2 airline company, together with its partner regional carriers, serves more than 120 cities across North America. Alaska Air Group also offers passenger and cargo services to/within Alaska.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of ALK for the past four quarters is 22.68%.\n\nDocuSign: The Zacks Rank #2 company is a global provider of cloud-based software. DocuSign’s anchor product eSignature helps businesses prepare, sign, act on and manage agreements digitally. Contract Lifecycle Management automates workflows across the agreement process. Insight scouts and analyzes agreements by legal concepts and clauses using artificial intelligence, and Analyzer analyzes inbound agreements by detecting clauses by type, scoring their risk and extracting important terms.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of DOCU for the past four quarters is 23.72%.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "Hybrid Headache: Why Rivian Stock May Sputter Amid This New Headwind",
        "content": "There’s no denying that electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) has been on the move recently. At the same time, the company is off to a very poor performance during the first half of this year. Unfortunately, circumstances could become even more challenging, warranting a cautious outlook for Rivian stock.\n\nIt’s not that the underlying enterprise is irrelevant. From a marketing standpoint, Rivian EVs may be some of the most gorgeous vehicles out there. Further, management is busy wheeling and dealing, attempting to please both consumers and shareholders. Unfortunately, the headwinds associated with the space may be too much for Rivian stock.\n\nYes, the ongoing price war presents a major dilemma, not just for RIVN but for the entire pure-play EV industry. However, what should really concern prospective investors is the rise of the hybrid vehicle. Combining battery and combustion-based propulsion, hybrids offer much of the efficiency of plug-in EVs with the infrastructural compatibility of traditional hydrocarbon-powered vehicles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLooking at the available data, hybrids are what the consumer wants right now. With that being the case, I’m not optimistic about Rivian stock.\n\nGood News May Not be Good Enough for Rivian Stock\n\nNo investment is perfectly good or bad and the same applies to Rivian stock. While I’m not enthused about its prospects, it has more to do with the harsh realities of the EV environment. Certainly, I can respect the efforts that management has forwarded.\n\nMost recently, the EV manufacturer disclosed last week it received $827 million in an incentive package from the Illinois government to expand operations at its Normal facility. This is the same plant that manufactures electric-powered delivery vans for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is Rivian’s largest investor.\n\nFurther, Rivian will also be producing a more modestly priced SUV called the R2. This was unveiled in March and takes aim at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), specifically its Model Y. On the surface, these and other developments appear incredibly lucrative for Rivian stock.\n\nHowever, news items such as the R2, which is projected for release in 2026 with a starting price of $45,000, represent previously digested information. The issue is that Rivian stock suffered a loss of more than 52% since the beginning of the year. If the market doesn’t believe in the underlying positive implications, it’s tough to wager on RIVN.\n\nTo be sure, the Amazon relationship is a huge one. Nevertheless, shareholders may need to wait for a while before Rivian is consistently profitable. That’s likely not what investors want to hear in the current economic environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nHybrids Impose a Longstanding Headwind\n\nOne risk factor in being directly bearish on Rivian stock is that the company will release its first-quarter earnings report on May 7. Given that other EV companies have released surprisingly robust delivery figures, anything can happen. To add to the narrative, RIVN could be the target of a short squeeze.\n\nAs the kids like to say, you don’t want to fool around because you’ll find out. Nevertheless, I think it’s fair to question the longer-term viability of Rivian stock. In particular, the EV maker may suffer longstanding competition from hybrids.\n\nAs CNN pointed out, Toyota (NYSE:TM) has been crushing its rivals, including EV giant Tesla, with its hybrids. Last year, the company sold 11.2 million vehicles. That was more than any other automaker. Not only that, a third of the tally were hybrids. With fewer than 1% of Toyota sales being allocated to plug-in EVs, the message is clear: consumers want hybrids.\n\nIt’s not a surprising development since about two-thirds of U.S. housing units have a garage or carport. That leaves quite a few folks who require public charging infrastructure if they make the switch to “pure” EVs. Hybrids don’t require that commitment.\n\nMoreover, the batteries that go into hybrids after the 2015 model year have proven resilient and reliable. So, once drivers acquire such hybrids, they’re less likely to switch platforms because of reliability issues. As well, the current economic situation means that hybrid drivers will likely hold onto their vehicles for as long as possible.\n\nRIVN May Be Too Niche of an Investment\n\nIn fairness to Rivian stock, the underlying directive to compete with the Tesla Model Y is noteworthy. The problem, though, is that Tesla commands enormous social cachet. People readily know who the CEO of Tesla is. I’d bet not too many folks can name Rivian’s head executive.\n\nIn other words, people want to buy Tesla because the company forged a highly desirable brand. For the ultra-rich consumers, they may prefer the premium label offerings of Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID). And for many, many middle-income drivers, they have overwhelmingly opened their wallets for Toyota hybrids.\n\nThat leaves Rivian competing for a niche consumer group; basically, drivers who want a Tesla alternative but don’t want to pay Lucid prices and who also haven’t been attracted to the myriad offerings presented by legacy automakers. That’s a tough sell, which is why I’m sitting on the sidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "‘Livestream’ shopping thwarts some high-tech tools to stop fake merch",
        "content": "By Arriana McLymore\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Livestream shopping where buyers and sellers transact in real-time video is growing in the United States while technology to police counterfeit goods has so far not kept up, a situation that makes it easier for fake goods to flood the market, patent lawyers said.\n\nLivestream shopping has been popularized by e-commerce sites like Alibaba.com and TikTok's sister company Douyin after dominating the retail scene in China.\n\nIn the U.S., TikTok merchants hawk jewelry, pre-owned Louis Vuitton handbags and $2 lip glosses during hours-long video sessions. Sellers’ streams can have dozens to thousands of viewers who ask about product materials, prices and availability.\n\nCopyright violations in live video are difficult to track. In general, e-commerce infringement enforcement can often feel like a game of \"whack-a-mole\" for lawyers and software companies who monitor the internet due to the swelling volume of violations. In one example, software firm Red Points spotted at least 4.6 million instances of global copyright violations in 2023, up from 4 million a year earlier.\n\nAmazon, the largest U.S. online marketplace, identified and seized 7 million counterfeit products from its marketplace sellers in 2023, up from 6 million in 2022, according the company's brand protection reports.\n\nLivestreaming is “haven for infringement until the detection and enforcement catches up to that mode of sales” said Luke DeMarte, an intellectual property lawyer at Michael Best & Friedrich, referring to live shopping.\n\nTikTok and Amazon both said they have advanced technology in place to stop merchants from selling fakes. TikTok said it monitors live video with a mixture of algorithms and humans and Amazon said it uses humans to monitor livestream shopping.\n\nLivestream sales on the web have promise. Americans will spend $1.32 trillion on U.S. e-commerce this year, according to eMarketer, a research firm. Live-commerce could reach 5% of that spending by 2026 as more traditional retailers including Macy's, Inditex's Zara, Nordstrom and Kohl’s adopt the marketing technique, according to Coresight Research.\n\nSome lawyers and the brands they represent use machine learning software to search e-commerce platforms for possible infringement in pictures, product descriptions and advertisements, but live videos bring added challenges.\n\n“By the time you see infringing products being sold on a TikTok live stream and it gets taken down, you should expect that at least some sales occurred in the interim,\" DeMarte said.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeMarte and other U.S. trademark lawyers said the live nature of livestream transactions makes it hard to identify and weed out counterfeits and fakes despite growth of new technologies aimed at detecting infringement.\n\nRetailers that launch shoppable video need to \"make sure that they have the mechanisms to prevent criminal activity or monitor it in real-time,\" Kari Kammel, director of the Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection at Michigan State University.\n\nArtificial intelligence and algorithms can currently spot still images and text that infringe on brands’ copyrights and trademarks, the lawyers and software firms say. Similarly, e-commerce platforms often use AI and algorithms to block third-party vendors from posting counterfeit merchandise.\n\nBut the technology to scan violations in video is scarce.\n\nSmall business attorney Michelle Murphy said she receives five to ten notifications every day from an AI vendor that tracks intellectual property infringement across still images listed on Etsy, eBay, Amazon and TikTok. Out of the hundreds of alerts she’s received, none of them have flagged infringement on shoppable video.\n\nKeeping counterfeits off their e-commerce sites is critical to the future of major U.S. retailers. TikTok has technology it says can detect potential infringement in live video streams, according to a TikTok Shop spokesperson. When content is flagged as infringing, it is removed and sent to a human moderator for review, the spokesperson said.\n\nSome third-party software vendors said they currently team up with TikTok Shop, generally by sharing information about suspected counterfeiters, to spot and police instances of infringement on the platform's live-shopping videos.\n\nAmazon expanded shoppable video to its streaming platforms Prime Video and Freevee in April. Its live feeds cover various product categories including electronic accessories, apparel and home goods that are advertised by influencers and reality TV stars.\n\nAmazon uses machine learning to scan its website for counterfeits; however, its livestreaming feature is manually moderated, the company said. The e-commerce giant requires that livestreamers only show products that are available on Amazon.com, which are subject to its machine learning scans.\n\nOther retailers hosting livestream shopping including Dyson only sell their brands' products or those that they hold a license to sell.\n\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City; Editing by Anna Driver)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What's a glitzy investing conference without a little \"Magnificent Seven\" banter?\n\n\"The risk is simple — those stocks don't do well,\" Avenue Capital Group founder and CEO Marc Lasry told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday.\n\nLasry was answering a question about the risk of overcrowding into tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — aka the Magnificent Seven.\n\n\"What has happened is when people are nervous, they invest in things that they know really well and they believe are going to be around,\" Lasry added. \"But I don't know what happens in the next year. I do know on the credit side, you've got all these opportunities.\" Apollo CEO Marc Rowan (right) weighs in on markets and the Mag Seven with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the Milken conference. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe former co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, Lasry has been investing in credit markets for more than four decades, giving him a reported net worth of $1.9 billion.\n\nSo suffice it to say, Lasry has seen a few investing cycles and market crazes.\n\nAnd the Magnificent Seven could be viewed as a craze.\n\nAltogether, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 37% of the S&P 500's 10.2% gain in the first quarter, according to data from S&P Global Indices. In 2023, the cohort constituted roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500's advance.\n\nThe optimism in the group reflects profit enthusiasm on everything from Nvidia's AI chips to Microsoft's Copilot productivity tool.\n\nBut with investors now more closely scrutinizing the Magnificent Seven amid higher interest rates, shares have slowed their roll.\n\nAs Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan explained, \"I'm not in the stock-picking business. But very few people come in every day and try to buy 45 or 50 P/E stocks. It's just not what we do.\" (Disclosure: Apollo Global Management is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.)\n\n\"I look at the broader trend. We used to have 8,000 public companies. We now have 4,000 public companies,\" he added. \"People think most of the action is in public markets. 80% of companies over a hundred million [in] revenue and 80% of employment is in private companies.\"\n\nSome top traders shared their views on how to trade the Magnificent Seven stocks on a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon, ServiceNow and Boston Scientific",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – May 7, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Netflix Inc. NFLX, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, ServiceNow Inc. NOW and Boston Scientific Corp. BSX.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nGolden Opportunity to Enter U.S. Stock Markets\n\nThe 15-month bull run of U.S. stock markets suffered a surprise setback in April. The Dow plunged 5%, marking its worst monthly performance since September 2022. The S&P 500 slid 4.2% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.4%. All three major stock indexes terminated a five-month winning streak. April is historically known as being favorable to Wall Street investors.\n\nWe believe April's meltdown is nothing but a bull market correction and this time a welcome one. After a disappointing month, May opens a golden opportunity to enter the equity market for those investors suffering from the FOMO (fear of missing out) syndrome. Finally, recently released economic data boosted market participants’ confidence in equities.\n\nResilient Labor Market Shows Signs of Softness\n\nThe Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, missing the consensus estimate of 200,000. Job additions in March were revised upward by 12,000 while those of February were revised downward by 34,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate increased to 3.9% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 3.8%. April marked the highest level since January 2022. Moreover, real unemployment rate (including discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons) edged up to 7.4%, its highest level since November 2021. The labor force participation rate was unchanged at 62.7% in April.\n\nMonth over month, the average hourly earnings rate dropped to 0.2% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 3.9% in April, below the consensus estimate of 4%. The average workweek decreased to 34.3.\n\nU.S. Economy is Cooling\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6% annualized rate in first-quarter 2024, well below the consensus estimate of 2.5%. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that both manufacturing and services PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) contracted in April.\n\nThe manufacturing PMI for April came in at 49.2% and that of services PMI was 49.4%. Any reading below 50% indicates contraction in activities. The manufacturing PMI expanded in March after 16 consecutive months of contraction. It again contracted in April. The services PMI contracted in April after 15 successive months of expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpectations of Interest Rate Cut Rise\n\nFollowing the release of the April’s nonfarm payrolls, the CME FedWatch shows a 67.4% probability that the central bank will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting. The interest rate futures tool also shows a massive 91.5% probability that the Fed will cut rate by 50 basis points. Notably, the Fed fund rate currently stays within the range of 5.25-5.5% since July 2023.\n\nOn May 1, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell categorically denied the resumption of the interest rate hike regime in his post-FOMC meeting statement. Moreover, the FOMC voted to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank’s gigantic balance sheet. The Fed started this program in June 2022, which was known as “quantitative tightening.” Its latest decision could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy.\n\nA Goldilocks Environment?\n\nA Goldilocks scenario is characterized as continuous economic growth but not as much a rapid pace to inflate the aggregate price level to such an extent that the central bank is compelled to tighten monetary policies.\n\nThe U.S. economy has cooled but is growing at a pace similar to that of the pre-pandemic level. The labor market shown the signs of crack but not at an alarming pace. The peak inflation rate is far behind us. Finally, there are no signs of any near-term recession. Consequently, this is a golden opportunity to enter U.S. stock markets.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have strong growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.\n\nFurther, stock prices of these companies have double-digit upside potential in the near-term. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s first-quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive. Also, the strength in YouTube favored the stock. Notably, a robust cloud division remains the key catalyst for GOOGL.\n\nExpanding data centers will continue to bolster GOOGL’s presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. GOOGL’s deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.1% and 30.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.5% over the last seven days. The average price targetrepresents an increase of 12.6% from the last closing price of $167.24.\n\nNetflix Inc. added 9.33 million paid subscribers globally in first-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 52.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days. The average price targetrepresents an increase of 13.6% from the last closing price of $579.34.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN in gaining momentum among customers.\n\nAMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 56.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 16% from the last closing price of $186.21.\n\nServiceNow Inc. has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. NOW had 1933 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value at the end of the first quarter. NOW had eight deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV, and four deals of more than $10 million.\n\nNOW closed 59 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. The number of customers contributing more than $20 million or more grew 50% year over year. Generative AI deals continued to gain traction with record-breaking net new ACV for Pro Plus, making it the fastest-selling product in NOW’s history.\n\nZacks Rank #2 ServiceNow has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.3% and 25.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $716.65.\n\nBoston Scientific Corp. is seeing strength across target markets despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation. Strong worldwide demand for BSX’s GI and pulmonary treatment options, traction in Europe for its next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers.\n\nThe Pain and Brain franchisees of BSX are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on the strong execution of core growth strategies. The EP arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Boston Scientific has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. The average price targetrepresents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $72.85.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "Only six American companies have a valuation of at least $1 trillion:\n\nMicrosoft, valued at $2.9 trillion. Apple, valued at $2.6 trillion. Nvidia, valued at $2.1 trillion. Alphabet, valued at $2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), valued at $1.9 trillion. Meta Platforms, valued at $1.1 trillion.\n\nAnd as this list shows, just four companies have crossed the $2 trillion threshold. But Amazon is now knocking on the door of that exclusive club. In fact, it gained admission in April for a brief period before its stock price pulled back.\n\nAmazon was founded in 1994 as an e-commerce company, but it has since evolved to build a gargantuan presence in other tech segments including cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon just released its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), and they were strong across the board. However, AI might be the technology that lifts this company's valuation to $2 trillion (and beyond) on a sustained basis.\n\nAmazon is weaving AI into its most important businesses\n\nE-commerce is Amazon's largest source of revenue, and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform is responsible for the overwhelming majority of the company's operating income (profit). Therefore, Amazon needs both segments firing on all cylinders, and it's currently using AI to drive their success.\n\nIn his Q1 conference call with investors, CEO Andy Jassy said that more than 100,000 sellers have used at least one of Amazon's generative AI tools to improve product listings and reach more customers. One of its newest tools allows sellers to automatically create detailed and engaging product pages by simply feeding Amazon's AI engine a link to their website. Other AI tools help sellers craft content for their advertisements to increase clicks and improve conversions.\n\nOn the cloud side, Amazon continued to make progress on its mission to dominate the three core layers of AI. Infrastructure is the bottom layer, and Jassy said demand remained high for AWS's new Trainium 2 chips, which were designed in-house, because of their favorable price and performance relative to competing hardware. They complement AWS's broad selection of data center instances powered by Nvidia's industry-leading graphics chips (GPUs).\n\nThe middle layer is home to Amazon Bedrock, which is a service for businesses that don't want to build and train their own AI large language models (LLMs). In Bedrock, they can access a portfolio of ready-made LLMs to accelerate the development of customer-facing AI applications. Those LLMs include some of the industry's most powerful, like Anthropic's Claude 3 and Meta Platforms' Llama 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, complete AI applications sit at the top layer. AWS developed a powerful AI virtual assistant called Q, which became widely available to customers in the first quarter. It's fully customizable and can be trained to enhance productivity within almost any business using internal data. It's capable of writing, testing, and debugging computer code, which Amazon says can save months of manual work. Plus, it can rapidly analyze mountains of data to spot trends and potential opportunities across an organization. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon delivered strong revenue growth, and soaring profits\n\nLast year, Amazon split its U.S. fulfillment network into eight separate regions. This allows fulfillment centers to hold increased levels of inventory for products that are popular in their own geographic area, and it also means those goods travel shorter distances to reach customers. The end result is faster delivery times; in March, Amazon said 60% of orders from its Prime members arrived on the same day or the next day across 60 of the largest U.S. metro areas.\n\nAmazon's theory is that speeding up delivery times will give customers the confidence to buy from its website more frequently, and Jassy points to the growing everyday essentials segment as evidence the strategy is working. Plus, growth in Amazon's online sales revenue overall appears to be accelerating. It increased by 7% to $54.7 billion during Q1, which was much faster than the 3% growth rate it delivered in the year-ago period.\n\nAWS cloud revenue came in at $25 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 17%, which was also an acceleration, both sequentially and compared to the year-ago period. AWS is currently the world's top cloud provider by revenue, and investors have longed for faster growth after a sluggish 2023 when businesses trimmed their spending due to high interest rates. That period of cost optimization appears to be over, according to Jassy, and he says momentum is picking up -- thanks especially to AI demand.\n\nFinally, Amazon's digital advertising revenue jumped 24% to $11.8 billion, making it the fastest-growing segment in the entire organization. Amazon.com receives 2.2 billion visits every month, making it the ideal place for merchants to advertise their products. Amazon also introduced ads to the Prime Video streaming service this year, and while it's still early days, this could be a lucrative opportunity as more of the $147.9 billion television ad market shifts to streaming.\n\nAcross all segments, Amazon's total revenue came in at $143.3 billion during Q1, which was a 13% year-over-year jump. The bigger story was on the bottom line; the company's net income (profit) soared 228% to $10.4 billion as management carefully controlled costs across all divisions.\n\nAmazon is a stone's throw away from the $2 trillion club\n\nWith a market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon stock only has to gain another 5.3% to join the $2 trillion club. Membership might be a mere formality at this point considering the company's growth, but there's a big reason Amazon could remain there for the long haul.\n\nAmazon generates more revenue than every company in the $2 trillion club. More than $574 billion flowed through its doors in 2023, compared to $394 billion for Apple, which led Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet. However, Amazon stock is cheaper than all of them on the basis of its price to sales (P/S) ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue): NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon is historically the least profitable company among its big-tech peers, primarily because its e-commerce business runs on razor thin margins. However, the company's net income has surged by triple-digit percentages in the last three quarters, which, in my opinion, should entice investors to pay a higher valuation multiple for Amazon's revenue over time. Its P/S ratio has slowly climbed over the past year, which is proof this is already happening.\n\nTherefore, not only will Amazon stock likely rise in the future based on the strong growth across its business, but there might also be a case of multiple expansion in its P/S ratio -- especially considering how far it's lagging behind Alphabet, which is next-to-last in the above chart.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Amazon launches online shopping service in South Africa",
        "content": "(Adds details, MD quote, context)\n\nJOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Reuters) - Amazon launched its online shopping service in South Africa on Tuesday, challenging a number of online retailers dominated by Naspers' Takealot.com.\n\nAfrica's most advanced economy is usually seen as a good entry point for companies to expand into the continent and Amazon could be doing the same, analysts have said in the past.\n\nThe launch of its service comes at a time when South Africa has seen a sharp rise in online shopping after the pandemic created an opportunity for e-commerce to finally take hold, with retailers doubling down on investments in response.\n\nAmazon.co.za will offer same-day delivery and next-day delivery with more than 3,000 pickup points. Shoppers will get free delivery on first orders, followed by free delivery for subsequent orders above 500 rand ($27.07), it said in a statement.\n\nCustomers in South Africa will be able to shop from a selection of local and international brands across 20 different product categories such as consumer electronics, home and small kitchen appliances, including international brands such as Apple, Amazon said.\n\nMore than 60% of the items sold in Amazon's stores globally are from independent sellers - most of which are small and medium-sized businesses.\n\n\"Building a strong relationship with South African brands and businesses is incredibly important to us. We want Amazon.co.za to be the place where they can reach millions of customers,\" said Robert Koen, managing director of Amazon Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSouth Africa's growing and evolving retail sector has also attracted international fast fashion e-commerce retailers Shein and Temu, with their rapid rise driven by robust demand for their low-priced apparel. Temu launched in the country earlier this year.\n\nRetailers are also doubling down on e-commerce investments as internet connectivity and smartphone penetration rises in the country.

Companies from Microsoft Corp. to Apple Inc. are also growing in the Southeast Asian market of more than 650 million people, partly to diversify away from China and reduce geopolitical risks amid tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\nIncluding the Singapore investment, AWS has this year announced plans to spend about $35 billion outside the US, including in Japan, Saudi Arabia and Mexico. The company is also setting up clusters of data centers in Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nAmazon last month said AWS was on track to bring in more than $100 billion in sales over the course of a year for the first time. Amazon executives say AWS is benefiting from corporate technology modernization projects as well as demand for AI services.\n\nThe announcement came as part of an AWS ASEAN Summit in Singapore, where AI will take center stage with a series of initiatives from the US company. The city-state was the first data center region AWS established in Asia.\n\nSingapore has grown into a hub for US businesses in Asia, such as Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc., and is seen as a gateway to the broader Southeast Asia region, which is expected to grow at a rapid clip.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon’s biggest rival in cloud services, did a tour of local economies last week, with Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella announcing a series of new investments and initiatives for Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChris Dixon’s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto’s Grifty Reputation The State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong Why Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring AI Is Helping Automate One of the World’s Most Gruesome Jobs Will GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon to rent 10 Boeing 767-300 freighters in fleet upgrade",
        "content": "Air Transport Services Group owns 40 of the 50 Boeing 767 cargo jets it will operate for Amazon for the next five years. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nAmazon has committed to lease 10 additional freighter aircraft from Air Transport Services Group and pay its partner to operate the aircraft over five years as part of a deal that deepens relations between the companies and underscores how the retailer is gaining in the U.S. parcel market.\n\nATSG (NASDAQ: ATSG) announced late Monday that it will begin flying the Boeing 767-300 cargo jets for Amazon’s logistics network this summer, with the potential to add another 10 aircraft, under a five-year contract that bundles aircraft and transportation services. The agreement also extends the existing flying contract, which runs until March 2026, for three more years and includes the award to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of an additional 2.9 million warrants to purchase ATSG shares.\n\nBy the end of the year, ATSG said it expects to operate 50 of the medium widebody freighters on Amazon’s behalf.\n\nAmazon already owns 19.5% of the Wilmington, Ohio-based aircraft leasing and aviation services company after exercising warrants in 2021. ATSG has been one of Amazon’s primary air transportation providers ever since the e-commerce giant launched its in-house cargo airline in 2016. ATSG said it also agreed to give Amazon more time to exercise vested warrants for 21.8 million shares previously issued to Amazon, as well as for unvested warrants for 2.9 million shares.\n\nThe new Amazon deal boosted ATSG’s full-year outlook for adjusted core operating activities by $10 million, to $516 million, from the figure presented in February. The projection includes costs associated with bringing the converted freighters into service.\n\nAmazon’s decision is a boon for airline subsidiary ABX Air, which will hire more than 50 pilots to support the contract after several years in Amazon’s doghouse because the pilots union conducted an unannounced strike on the eve of Black Friday and essentially shut down Amazon’s delivery network for more than a day. The Airline Professionals Association, which is under the Teamsters umbrella, has recently taken great pains to promote ATSG and the company’s service quality in an effort to drum up business and, in due course, a strong contract for the pilots.\n\nABX Air currently operates 24 B767 aircraft but only about four freighters within Amazon’s air network.\n\nATSG provides and flies 30 Boeing 767 freighters for Amazon. Amazon provides 10 more aircraft that ATSG operates on its behalf. The amended transportation services agreement brings to 50 the total number of aircraft operated within Amazon’s air network.\n\nThe arrangement essentially reverses Amazon’s decision to return 12 Boeing 767-200 converted freighters when their leases expired – seven last month and five last year. The 767-200s are older and smaller than the 767-300s.\n\nStory continues\n\nA year ago it was unclear whether Amazon planned to reduce business with ATSG after not immediately replacing the relinquished 767-200s as e-commerce demand softened and Amazon added Hawaiian Airlines as a partner carrier to operate large Airbus A330 freighters.\n\nAlthough online shopping demand has decreased since exploding to record heights during the pandemic, Amazon has gained parcel volume and taken market share from FedEx and UPS in the U.S. market, according to recent research from Pitney Bowes. Amazon shipped 5.9 billion packages last year, up 16% y/y and second only to the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nRelated: ABX Air pilots choose cooperation over confrontation\n\nATSG’s revenue for the first quarter was $486 million, down 3% year over year. It reported adjusted operating income of $15.2 million, down $22.6 million from the same period in 2023. Results were better than analysts expected.\n\nLeasing revenue decreased 7% in the quarter, reflecting the return of 16 widebody freighters since March 2023 and reduced flight tempo by network customers like Amazon and DHL Express. ATSG’s transportation services contracts include maintenance. When aircraft fly fewer hours, the company generates less revenue from an engine maintenance program that is based on the number of cycles put on the engines. In the past year, ATSG also leased 15 freighters, including three Airbus A321 narrowbody freighters.\n\nDuring the first quarter, ATSG deployed four newly converted 767-300 freighters to external customers. In March, Uzbekistan-based My Freighter received a 767 from ATSG.\n\nATSG, which released earnings after the market closed, said revenue from its cargo airlines, ABX Air and Air Transport International, dipped 3.3% with three fewer aircraft in service than a year ago. Cargo flight hours decreased 3% during the first quarter, primarily due to greater deployment on shorter domestic routes and less international flying.\n\nATSG has 114 converted cargo jets in service, two more than at the end of 2023, with 46 leased to other airlines. It also operates 19 passenger charter jets through a company called Omni Air International. An additional 24 passenger aircraft acquired by ATSG are in, or awaiting, cargo modification at airframe overhaul facilities.\n\nInvestors have beaten down ATSG’s stock over the past 18 months over concerns management was continuing to acquire aircraft for freighter conversions while the global air cargo market was in a major slump. Management insisted its long-term strategy would pay off as the market recovered, but it responded to the pressure by reducing its capital budget and terminating CEO Rich Corrado in October.\n\nThe Amazon commitment for more freighters should improve investor confidence in the company’s ability to deliver returns, especially after ATSG also said it generated $15 million in free cash flow during the first quarter.\n\nATSG’s stock price increased 6.4% to $14.10 per share in after hours trading.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nABX Air pilots choose cooperation over confrontation\n\nCargo airline sends new Boeing 767 freighters directly to storage\n\nInflation tempers Cargojet’s outlook despite Q1 volume growth\n\nThe post Amazon to rent 10 Boeing 767-300 freighters in fleet upgrade appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy to Satisfy Your IRA Limits in 2024",
        "content": "2023 tax season has come and gone meaning it is time to consider 2024 contributions to your IRA. That will include some mix of Index and mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and individual stocks. The maximum contribution in 2024 is $7,000 for those under 50 years of age and $8,000 for those 50 and older.\n\nWhile most investors will be primarily mixing funds and bonds many will also be picking individual stocks to add to their IRAs. How much money an investor dedicates to individual stocks within an IRA is largely a function of risk tolerance. Generally speaking, the higher that contribution, the more risk and reward it entails.\n\nThat said, let’s look at some of the better individual stocks to choose when considering IRA contribution limits in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is going to be one of the most popular large cap choices in an individual IRA in 2024. Many investors will have exposure to Microsoft through various index funds and ETFs. However, here we’re advocating for purchasing MSFT shares on an individual basis as part of an individual retirement account.\n\nFrankly, investing in Microsoft should be an easy choice. Analysts recommend purchasing Microsoft on a near unanimous basis. It’s generally expected that the value of those shares should rise by between 20% in a base case scenario and by as much as 50% should things rapidly improve.\n\nThere’s plenty of reason to believe in that best case scenario when one looks at the firm’s most recent earnings report from April 25. Revenues grew by 17% and net income increased by 20%. Thus, it’s entirely logical to believe that the value of the stock will rise by 20% moving forward. I like Microsoft because its AI fueled Cloud growth is a particular bright spot. Otherwise, investors should continue to consider Microsoft for its blend of growth and scale that has rarely been rivaled in the past.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealtyIncome (NYSE:O) represents an excellent individual stock choice within an IRA, especially for income-oriented investors. Each share includes a dividend yielding 5.6% paid as a monthly dividend. The beauty of a monthly dividend is that it includes three times as many distributions meaning greater opportunities to compound gains.\n\nRealty Income is also well-positioned defensively. Although the company is very retail oriented, it is highly recession resistant. The vast majority of its tenants operate in recession resistant sectors. That generally includes grocery stores, dollar stores, drugstores and other retail categories that tend to be non-cyclical in nature.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other thing to note about Realty Income is the structure of the leases it signs with its tenants. They tend to be longer, usually on the order of 10 years. Further, the triple net agreements place many of the cost responsibilities on the tenants themselves. That leaves more money for investors and shareholders in the end.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Close-up photo of hands holding glass Coca Cola (KO) bottles, clinking them together. One hand has a bottle opener and is opening a bottle.\n\nSource: BORIMAT PRAOKAEW / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will continue to show up on lists and articles discussing the best stocks to invest in. Whether it’s related to Warren Buffett or defensive positioning and anticipation of a weakening economy, Coca-Cola is generally well regarded.\n\nIt’s that ladder notion – a potential economic weakening – that bears discussion.  A lot of the issue centers around the ongoing fight against inflation. The Federal Reserve has not had as much success in the last few months as it would have liked. That leads some to believe that inflation will be much more persistent than initially believed.\n\nI believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to benefit from that ongoing issue. First of all, Coca-Cola is one of the best defensive stocks there is. It tends to weather economic downturns better than the vast majority of the stock market. Further, consumers continue to buy Coca-Cola products despite higher prices brought on by inflation. In fact, the company raised its guidance for 2024 due to that fact. If inflation will indeed continue to prove more sticky than initially believed, Coca-Cola looks uniquely positioned to thrive regardless.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to deal with a period of stagnation and slowing sales. The news there isn’t all bad by any means. while Apple’s sales and earnings did decline on a year-over-year basis, each also bested guidance.\n\nApple decided to placate investor worries by increasing its share buyback program while simultaneously increasing its dividend by 4%. So, Apple is trying to introduce greater share price stability via more conservative means. The market seems to have appreciated the efforts. However, that is not the only reason to buy Apple at the moment.\n\nThe company remains tight-lipped about its AI plans. CEO Tim Cook is likely to divulge the details about Apple’s AI future at the firm’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.\n\nThe best time to have invested in Apple would have been a few days ago before the share buyback announcement. However, all is not lost. Apple’s shares are strengthening again as it appears dedicated to stability. That, along with the potential for a price spike in June suggest that investors should buy in the interim.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s difficult not to like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock at the moment. Aside from the ever persistent threat of anti-monopoly litigation there’s very little to dislike. Amazon has largely avoided that threat for so long that it’s probably better to just ignore it wholesale. Instead, investors should focus on its earnings report and what it says about the company’s future.\n\nSales increased by 13%, rising to $143.3 billion. The company’s Cloud service – Amazon Web Services – continues to thrive. As good as those numbers are, the focus is really all about artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company announced a generative AI based assistant intended to speed software development. That AI assistant should be particularly powerful from the perspective that it leverages Amazon’s AWS cloud. The company concurrently announced Bedrock, a fully managed AI service for quickly building and launching applications.\n\nThose developments –  along with strong results – suggest that Amazon is an excellent individual stock choice in any IRA.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to face a bevy of headwinds that have pulled its share prices lower by about 15%. Those headwinds include news that its Blackwell chips might ship later than initially anticipated, disappointing guidance from rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and ongoing concerns regarding when in 2024, if at all, rate cuts will occur.\n\nBuy it anyway because it is one of the best individual stocks to have in your IRA or otherwise. The simple fact remains that until another firm produces better AI chips than Nvidia does, there’s no reason to doubt the company over the mid and long-term. The artificial intelligence boom continues to be the greatest opportunity for investors of this generation.\n\nNvidia dominates demand for the chips that power the AI boom. However, Nvidia’s strengths extend beyond chips alone when it comes to AI. The company is rapidly moving into the artificial intelligence fueled humanoid robots sector. The Project GR00T foundational model is going to be an interesting theme to follow. Nvidia has clearly affected the data center space and may ultimately disrupt the entire economy down to the factory floor.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is arguably the best choice of the top three credit card stocks. Actually, if you follow the returns it’s inarguable that it’s the best. American Express has outperformed Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in 2023. That outperformance spans back more than 5 years and suggests that American Express will continue to outperform its rivals.\n\nThat logically begs the question of why American Express has been able to outperform other credit card stocks. My theory is that it relates to credit worthiness. American Express serves a higher income consumer base which is more credit-worthy. The risk of non-payments and defaults is much lower and as a result AXP shares simply outperform.\n\nFrankly speaking, any of the major three credit card stocks are good choices for the purpose of an IRA investment: each is relatively stable and well exposed to fintech growth opportunities. However, for all of the reasons I just discussed, American Express stands head and shoulders above the other two.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the investment landscape surrounding US retirement, you may go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Alabama.\n\nDecoding Retirement Investing\n\nTurns out college students aren’t the only ones prone to leaving things to the last minute - several adults are pretty much on the same track when it comes to saving for their retirement. In the US, there is no legal requirement under which a company has to offer a 401(k) plan to its employees in most states- although companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) do offer 401(k) plans with partial matching. Without this requirement, many people miss out on saving for retirement altogether.\n\nIn fact, according to Ramsey Solutions, employer-sponsored retirement savings plans are withheld from about a third of US workers, whereas the latest Survey of Consumer Finances reports that a massive 46% of Americans are without a retirement account altogether. All this does not seem very promising, especially with a Northwestern Mutual study revealing that Americans themselves believe they require a whopping $1.46 million for a comfortable retirement.\n\nThe question of the hour, then, is how can this disparity between what Americans need in their retirement and what they currently have be solved? Founder and CEO of hedge fund management company Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, has a rather unique perspective. Ackman proposes that the US government give every newborn child in the country seven grand. Of course, Ackman doesn’t propose simply handing the money away. Instead, he details putting $7,000 into an account when a child is born, barring it from withdrawals, exempting it from taxation, using it in index fund investment, and letting the amount compound.\n\n“We can't wait until people start creating an IRA or a 401(k) by the time they're, you know, 25 or 30 or 35 ... Just because of the laws of compounding. That extra 25 years is very, very material.”\n\n-Bill Ackman, Founder and CEO, Pershing Square Capital Management\n\nAccording to numbers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 3.6 million children were born in the US in 2023. If Ackman’s advice is implemented, the cost comes out to about $25 billion. While this number may seem shockingly high, it’s a drop in the ocean compared to the US government’s 2024 fiscal year spending which included a national defense budget of $433 billion.\n\nAs for more real avenues, there are other paths that individuals can explore for retirement savings in the case of their company not offering a 401(k) plan. Some options that Americans can look towards include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and health savings accounts. Each of these has its own benefit. For instance, traditional IRAs allow you to accumulate tax-advantaged retirement dollars, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals and growth during retirement as well as flexibility as there are no minimum distributions, and health savings accounts are also known for their tax-free growth. Of course, these are just some of the retirement savings options available to individuals, and the investment world is much more vast. So, even if you don’t enroll in plans such as those offered by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees, all is not lost when it comes to saving and investing for your Golden Years. There’s no age limit to it either - even if you’ve reached your 50s, there are still steps that you can take to secure your retirement. For possible ideas, you can refer to retirement savings tips for 55-to-64-year-olds.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs An Alabama Retirement the One?\n\nSpeaking of saving and investing, the amount that you accumulate for your retirement is directly tied to the location of your retirement. Consider Alabama, for instance - $2,500 a month would fare very differently than in states such as California or New Jersey. Starting off with one of the biggest monthly expenses, the state of Alabama is extremely accommodating when it comes to rent. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) lists the median price for a one-bedroom rental in Alabama to sit at $925 - a whole 42% lower than Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z)’s reported national median of $1,600.\n\nThe state is also tax-friendly toward retirees. Not only is Alabama among the states that won’t tax Social Security income in 2024, but private and public pensions are also exempt from taxation. On the non-financial side, there are other benefits to an Alabama retirement with climate being one of them. The state enjoys a temperate humid subtropical climate, ideal for retirees who want to avoid extreme weather conditions. All in all, retiring in Alabama is a good idea.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the move to Alabama state, we have compiled a list of the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. 15 Best Places to Retire in Alabama\n\nA banker helping an elderly customer understand the finer details of a deposit product.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 15 best places to retire in Alabama, we consulted several sources including our lists on retiring to Alabama, Cheap and Beautiful Places to Retire in the US,  Safest Places to Retire in the US, Best US Cities to Retire with $1 Million in Retirement Savings, as well as external sources such as Niche, NewHomeSource, Movoto, Unbiased, and Retirable.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled, we ranked them across multiple factors, namely, cost of living, livability scores, median house price, and environmental scores. For this article, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN), and the cost of living index and environmental scores were our own. To ensure that the recommended places were of a suitable living standard, we removed places with a livability score below 60 and only included places that were above the US average environmental score of 56.5. A cumulative score was assigned - livability scores and environmental scores were given double weightage - with the 15 highest-scoring places making our list of the 15 best places to retire in Alabama. For places that gained an equal score, their livability scores were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 15 best places to retire in Alabama:\n\n15.

Residents can spend their days at the Vestavia Bowl Bowling Alley, the Old Overton Golf Club, and, of course, the Cajun Seafood House where they can tuck into a delicious seafood dinner.\n\n11. Prattville\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 76\n\nLivability Score: 75\n\nCost of Living Index: 89.4\n\nMedian House Price: $235,000\n\nEnvironmental Score: 57\n\nA dual-county city, Prattville is located in the counties of Elmore and Autauga.

        "title": "25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 states with the highest and lowest resignation rates. We have also discussed the state of jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates.\n\nThe state of US jobs in recent times has been nothing less than a paradox as the headline job numbers seem to be strong but Americans are struggling to secure jobs. Despite the addition of 275,000 jobs in February 2024 alone, the labor market has become increasingly competitive, with companies exercising caution in hiring given the economic uncertainty.\n\nThe hiring slowdown can be attributed to various factors, including companies being wary of high interest rates and wages, leading to a more selective hiring process. As a result, the job market has become more challenging for both recent graduates and seasoned professionals alike. Speaking of hiring, see industries hiring rightnow in 2024.\n\nIt is also true that the current job market is plagued by a mismatch between job openings and the skills and qualifications of job seekers. Despite there being 8.9 million job openings in January, down from a peak of 12 million in March 2022, many positions remain unfilled, while workers struggle to secure employment that matches their qualifications.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in Monster's “New Year, New Career” 2024 report, 95% of surveyed US workers expressed intent to seek new job opportunities. Despite the widespread desire for change, Monster's findings reveal a cautious sentiment among workers as 68% individuals believe that it will be challenging to secure new employment due to economic conditions.\n\nMoreover, employers are faced with mounting pressure to address employee concerns, as indicated by Deloitte's Q4 2023 CFO Survey, which highlights the growing importance of competitive compensation and transparent communication to retain talent. With 45% of workers citing the need for higher income and 64% anticipating salary adjustments to counter inflation, businesses are urged to adapt their strategies to navigate evolving workforce dynamics effectively.\n\nIt must be noted that in 2024, leisure and hospitality is the industry with the highest resignation rate in the US. On the other hand, information is one of the industries with the lowest turnover rates.\n\nApart from the resignation rates, there are also concerns about layoffs. For example, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s recent decision to reduce its workforce in marketing and communications has sparked concern, with reports indicating a major impact on staffing levels. In a brief meeting led by International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s Chief Communications Officer Jonathan Adashek, employees were informed of the impending job cuts, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future direction.\n\nStory continues\n\nThroughout the tech industry, job cuts have become increasingly common, with over 200 companies announcing layoffs, affecting nearly 50,000 positions so far this year. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s restructuring efforts align with its strategy to adapt to evolving market demands, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence. Despite recent growth, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) continues to face challenges in monetizing its AI offerings, facing stiff competition from industry giants like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nOn the other hand, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has adopted a strategy of prudent hiring. In 2023, the company reduced its headcount by 22%, down to 67,317, as part of cost-cutting measures amid challenges in the digital ad market. Despite this reduction, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s performance has been impressive, with fourth-quarter sales growing by 25% to $40.1 billion, and net income increased by 201% to $14 billion. The company's operating margin more than doubled to 41%, showcasing its ability to grow while cutting costs.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) plans to maintain this lean approach to hiring, focusing on high-paying technical roles rather than hyper growth. The company intends to prioritize investments in infrastructure, particularly in artificial intelligence, with total expenses expected to range between $94 billion to $99 billion. Zuckerberg aims to keep Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) culturally aligned with this lean strategy even beyond 2024, reflecting a long-term commitment to efficiency and stability. 25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates\n\nPhotographee.eu/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the states with the highest and lowest resignation rates, we relied on Selectsoftware’s data on quit rates by state collected from July 2023 to October 2023. The list is presented in descending order of resignation rates.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n25. Alaska\n\nResignation Rate: 3.55%\n\nAlaska ranks 2th on our list. With 3.55% resignation rate, Alaska is the state with the highest turnover rate in the US.\n\n24. Montana\n\nResignation Rate: 3.30%\n\nMontana faces challenges in employment owing to its sparse population, limited diversity of industries, and geographical isolation. The state's economy heavily relies on agriculture, tourism, and natural resource extraction, which may not offer as many job opportunities as more diversified economies.\n\n23. Louisiana\n\nResignation Rate: 3.28%\n\nLouisiana is facing on of the highest resignation rates primarily due to the staggering economic impact of insufficient childcare. The annual loss of $1.1 billion in productivity, coupled with a $84 million shortfall in tax revenue, sheds light on the severity of the issue. Women and single parents are disproportionately affected and represent 14.6% and 11.1% respectively of those forced to quit jobs due to childcare problems. Additionally, with 50% of households relying on family members for childcare, the burden falls heavily on informal support networks.\n\n22. West Virginia\n\nResignation Rate: 3.28%\n\nWest Virginia faces challenges in its labor market due to factors like limited job opportunities, low wages, and inadequate workers' rights protections. The state's heavy reliance on industries like coal mining has led to economic instability, while high rates of poverty and limited access to education exacerbate the problem.\n\n21. Wyoming\n\nResignation Rate: 3.25%\n\nWyoming has consistently held the ignominious title of being the deadliest state for workers, with workplace fatalities per 100,000 workers reaching 13 in 2020, surpassing the second-worst state by a significant margin. Despite a 23% improvement in the per-capita fatality rate in 2021, Wyoming still ranked worst in the nation. The state's workplace safety track record remains dismal, with incidents ranging from falls and machinery accidents to fatal road incidents and even ice-related tragedies. Worker advocates highlight the urgent need for action, pointing to policies lacking in protection for employees and an attitude that dismisses safety concerns.\n\n20. Delaware\n\nResignation Rate: 3.20%\n\nThe proximity of Delaware to major metropolitan areas like Philadelphia and New York City provides residents with abundant job opportunities, making it easier for them to find new employment, if dissatisfied. Additionally, Delaware's economy is heavily influenced by industries like finance, healthcare, and technology, which often experience higher turnover rates due to competitive job markets and evolving job roles.\n\n19. Mississippi\n\nResignation Rate: 3.15%\n\nMississippi's high resignation rate stems from multifaceted challenges. Despite offering the nation's lowest cost of living, worker migration remains low due to a workforce lacking in education and productivity. With only 3% employed in STEM fields and 23% holding bachelor's degrees, the state struggles to meet the demands of modern industries. Additionally, its unfriendly business environment, coupled with discriminatory laws, further deter skilled professionals.\n\n18. South Carolina\n\nResignation Rate: 3.10%\n\nThe state has chosen not to adopt more generous labor policies compared to the national standards, such as keeping the minimum wage at the federal level and prohibiting local governments from setting higher minimum wages. Additionally, the absence of mandated paid sick and parental leave further exacerbates workers' challenges. The presence of right-to-work laws weakens unions, impacting workers' collective bargaining power. Historical racial dynamics also play a role, with states like North Carolina implementing less generous labor policies.\n\nIt is also one of the States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.\n\n17. Idaho\n\nResignation Rate: 3.00%\n\nIdaho ranks poorly for work due to several factors. Firstly, it scores 41st in the country for wage policies, mainly because of its low minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which hasn't changed since 2009. Additionally, Idaho's tipped wage is also low at $3.35 per hour. Secondly, its worker protections rank 27th, lacking mandates for equal pay, paid sick leave, and protections against pay secrecy and shift scheduling changes.\n\n16. Tennessee\n\nResignation Rate: 3.00%\n\nThe state of Tennessee is experiencing a shift in its employment landscape as the turnover increase abates. Job openings have declined, particularly in industries like technology and banking, prompting a stabilization in hiring practices. While layoffs are occurring among major corporations, small businesses continue to modestly expand their workforce.\n\n15. Kentucky\n\nResignation Rate: 2.88%\n\nIn Kentucky, there's a pressing need for police officers, with hundreds of positions remaining unfilled across the state. Covington Capt. Jonathan Colwell highlights the challenges, citing diminishing incentives such as less appealing retirement packages. Ft. Wright Mayor Dave Hatter echoes this sentiment, attributing recruitment difficulties to changes in the pension system over the years.\n\n14. Arizona\n\nResignation Rate: 2.85%\n\nFollowing an increase tied to the pandemic, Arizona's resignations are returning to normal. The state's trajectory aligns with the national trend during \"The Great Resignation,\" where job seekers benefited from increased hiring incentives. November saw Arizona's resignation rate drop to 2.7 from 3.0 a year prior.\n\n13. New Mexico\n\nResignation Rate: 2.53%\n\nNew Mexico's resignations show a moderate rate owing to its economic stability, job opportunities, and workplace satisfaction. Unlike states with high turnover, New Mexico offers a relatively favorable environment for retention, supported by effective policies, a balanced economy, and a manageable cost of living.\n\n12. Michigan\n\nResignation Rate: 2.08%\n\nMichigan has one of the lowest resignation rates in the US, with a diverse economic landscape contributing to its stability. According to BLS, in 2017, the state housed 3,859,949 employees across 222,553 establishments. Its Q1 2023 gross state product reached $645.293 billion, ranking 14th nationally.\n\n11. Illinois\n\nResignation Rate: 1.98%\n\nWith a strategic focus on business development and economic growth, Illinois has tripled incentivized private investments to nearly $3 billion since 2022, creating thousands of new jobs. Its advantageous location, modern infrastructure, and strong transportation networks make it a prime destination for companies seeking to expand.\n\nClick here to see the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates 15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024 25 Countries with the Highest Employment Rates in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: This Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Member Just Poured $11 Billion Into Data Centers",
        "content": "There are many opportunities for investors when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI). Breakthroughs in accelerated computing and high-performance semiconductor chips are making impacts on myriad products and services.\n\nIn the background, one of the more lucrative opportunities benefiting from the booming AI demand is data centers. While Nvidia is the 800 pound gorilla in data center services, smart investors understand that there are many businesses competing alongside the chip giant.\n\nOne thing that might come as a surprise, however, is that not all data center investment prospects are traditional infrastructure and storage plays. In fact, one of Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers is getting in on the action.\n\nAlthough Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is best known for its e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing platform, the company recently announced that it's planning an $11 billion investment to build data centers in Indiana.\n\nLet's break down why Amazon is interested in building its own data center infrastructure, and how these investments could lead to robust long-term gains in the future.\n\nIt started with Amazon's $4 billion partnership\n\nLast September, Amazon announced that it was investing $4 billion into an AI start-up called Anthropic. At the time of the announcement, Amazon poured $1.25 billion into Anthropic -- with the additional $2.75 billion coming in late March.\n\nThe core thesis of the investment revolves around Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing platform. The last couple of years have been challenging for the macroeconomy, as unusually high inflation and rising borrowing costs have significantly impacted both consumers and businesses. Enterprise software providers were not immune to these hiccups, and experienced decelerating sales growth.\n\nOne of the key aspects surrounding the deal was that Anthropic agreed to train future generative AI models on AWS. Moreover, Anthropic's models are also being trained on Amazon's in-house semiconductor chips Inferentia and Trainium.\n\nWhile these details may have looked subtle at the time, Amazon's latest move proves that the company isn't messing around when it comes to building an AI behemoth -- and Anthropic represents an important pillar in that roadmap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNow, Amazon is doubling down\n\nAWS is now a $100 billion revenue run-rate business. It's clear that as AWS has become a more prominent feature of Amazon's growth strategy, the company has invested significantly into cloud infrastructure -- demonstrated by rising capital expenditure spend over the last 10 years.\n\nStory continues AMZN Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThese investments don't appear to be slowing down, either. Amazon recently announced that it is planning an $11 billion investment for data centers in Indiana.\n\nI see the ambitions in data centers as a mechanism to complement the Anthropic investment. Amazon is developing its own custom chips in an effort to migrate away from an overreliance on Nvidia's graphics processing units.\n\nSimilar to how Amazon perfected warehouse efficiencies and shipping logistics by making hefty investments in fulfillment operations, Amazon appears to be mimicking this playbook as the company seeks to internalize as much of its AI roadmap as possible.\n\nIn the long run, I think these efforts will pay off in many different ways. Namely, Amazon can broaden its AI capabilities, which should unlock new growth opportunities for AWS. Furthermore, over time I suspect that building its own data centers and using its in-house chips will lead to cost saving.\n\nDon't worry, Amazon has heaps of cash\n\nOne thing that could be causing some trepidation are the price tags attached to these lofty AI goals. But don't worry, Amazon has tons of cash. Image source: Amazon Investor Relations.\n\nFor the trailing 12 months ended March 31, Amazon generated $50 billion in free cash flow. Moreover, at the end of the first quarter, the company held $84 billion of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet.\n\nAmazon's CEO Andy Jassy provided investors with assurance regarding the company's planned infrastructure investments during the first-quarter earnings call as well. He stated:\n\nThe more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way. We remain very bullish on AWS.\n\nMy interpretation of the above commentary is that Amazon will likely continue building out data centers in the future, so long as demand for AI warrants these investments. Considering that Jassy was CEO of AWS for 18 years before taking the reins over Amazon's entire business, I'm optimistic about his outlook for the company's growth in cloud and AI.\n\nI find the investments in Anthropic, chips, and data centers to be extremely savvy and am bullish that these will all help ignite a new stage of growth for AWS.\n\nRight now, Amazon trades at a 3.2 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. This is essentially flat compared to the company's 10-year average P/S. Investors with a long-term time horizon may want to consider scooping up shares of Amazon right now as the company's AI journey is just beginning.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Pay You to Own Them: Spring 2024 Edition",
        "content": "One-third of your wealth should be in securities, one-third should be in real estate, and one-third should be in jewelry and art. So went an investment maxim of the Rothschild family, “arguably the most successful (in a financial sense) in history.”\n\nSecurities, especially stocks, are the best, both from the buy side and the sell side. Buying securities online in my Bank of America account would be commission-free. I just listed my house for sale at a 5% commission. For commercial real estate, it can be 10%. Art commissions are in the double digits. A friend owns a small art gallery in Charleston and her commission is 40%, as many collectibles are very thinly traded, resulting in a much higher commission.\n\nAs for carrying costs, insurance for real estate, jewelry and art can be very expensive. There are no such costs for a stock. And stocks are far superior to real estate or collectibles in generating income!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven better, if the stocks are in a retirement account, which cannot hold art or other collectibles, the income produced is tax-free! These three dividend stocks to buy will pay you to own them, whether you want to follow the Rothschild maxim or not.\n\nAT&T (T) A photo of an AT&T office building.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there was a dating app for stocks ideal for generating income, everyone would be swiping right on AT&T (NYSE:T). No need for a good personality when there is a 6.6% dividend yield!\n\nThe company is also a Dividend Aristocrat, meaning it has increased its dividend annually for more than 25 years. AT&T also has a high level of institutional ownership, which means there is a demand for the options. Hedge funds, pension groups and other institutional investors use options to protect their stock holdings against swings in the market.\n\nThis high level of institutional ownership is why the beta for AT&T is so low at 0.55x. This facilitates capture-the-dividend trading, where the stock is bought and sold just for the dividend, as there are limited concerns about wild price swings making this unprofitable if the share price heads south.\n\nDaily volume is over 38 million shares so there is plenty of liquidity to buy and sell into without moving the price or distorting the market.\n\nDow (DOW) DOW Chemical sign outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nDow (NYSE:DOW) is another company with solid institutional ownership. The dividend yield is nearly 5%, which appeals to both individuals and institutions! The higher the dividend yield, the more profit potential for capture-the-dividend trades, too. What makes writing options even more appealing is that the dividend income and the option premium go to the investor as they are listed as the shareholder of record. This is all tax-free if in a retirement account!\n\nStory continues\n\nDow does have a high dividend payout ratio. This is actually a good sign for income investors as it shows the commitment of the company to maintaining the dividend.\n\nEarnings have increased more than 30% this year, with a more-than-40% increase projected over the next five years. The payout ratio is expected to decline significantly as earnings rise, which is a good thing!\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco bay\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is more than enough bearish sentiment, by contrast, for United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). UPS stock is down for the last quarter, year and year-to-date. That adds to its appeal for generating income as the dividend yield is higher when the price is lower.\n\nMore to the point, legendary investor Warren Buffett looks for a return on equity of at least 14%. For UPS, it is over 32%. At 4.5%, the dividend yield should please all income investors! Coupled with the high dividend, earnings per share are expected to increase by about 18% next year and over 10% the next five years which will reward shareholders. UPS is trading near a 52-week low, and you have to love the economic moat of a cargo carrier.\n\nAerospace consultant Dr. Mike Heil, who headed the Ohio Aerospace Institute told InvestorPlace that “there are significant, but not insurmountable, challenges to starting an air cargo delivery company. This is a mature market with well-established competitors and the capital requirements are large.”\n\nIn terms of the competition for market share by revenue, UPS is No. 1 at 37%. It controls 70% of the market with FedEx (NYSE:FDX). Amazon Air, a cargo airline from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is at 12%, with the U.S. Postal Service at 17%. Even more bullish news for Big Brown is that UPS is taking the USPS business away from FedEx!\n\nOn the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 10 Stocks to Buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 5 Stocks.\n\nCramer Thanks Powell for \"All-Clear\" Sign\n\nJim Cramer last week thanked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for giving an \"all-clear\" sign by keeping interest rates unchanged. Cramer said that the Fed's dovish comments catapulted the market from the pits of deep red to new highs.\n\nJerome Powell: \"The Bull's Best Friend\"\n\nHe thinks Jerome Powell has become \"the bull's friend for the moment, maybe best friend.\" Jim Cramer said that despite the signs of \"softness all over the place,\" Powell is currently \"more of a dove than a hawk\" since he believes inflation will \"go away on its own.\"\n\nPowell Takes Another Rate-Hike Scenario Off the Table\n\nCramer said Jerome Powell was \"badgered\" by the media about the possibility of another rate hike. But Powell, according to Cramer, is \"too smart\" as he didn’t take the \"bait\" and took the \"dreaded\" rate hike scenario \"off the table.\"\n\n\" I think Jay Powell has realized that these brown shoots are doing the work for him and his consistent messaging in the face of endless Fedspeak tells me that I think you should hand on to stocks.\"\n\nCramer Laments About The Market's Obsession with Fed\n\nJim Cramer in another program last week again voiced his frustrations about the market's obsession with the Federal Reserve's comment, saying jobs numbers, inflation, possibility of rate cuts and the Fed's future moves is \"all we talk about.\" Cramer said that some analysts were expecting the Fed chief Jerome Powell to \"lower the boom\" of the stock market by \"saying something hawkish.\" Cramer is surprised that some circles in the market are talking about another raise.\n\n\"We are one again hostage to everyone's worries about the Fed which is another way of saying, everyone's worries about inflation.\"\n\nJim Cramer on What Should You Buy in the Current Environment\n\nAfter analyzing the current market situation, Cramer came straight to what matters the most for an average investor:\n\n\"So, what wins in this environment? What do you do? Well, pretty much everything is going to kind of work here,\" Cramer said before analyzing different stocks some of which we will discuss in this article.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't Miss: Jim Cramer's Stock Picks Heading into May 2024 Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors in the current market environment. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nJim Cramer is anxiously waiting for the latest quarter report from Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) as his charitable trust owns a position in the company. In a latest program, Cramer highlighted that Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) has two casinos in Macau. Cramer is bullish on the China business of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) because he thinks the Chinese are \"willing to travel locally.\"\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is scheduled to post earnings May 7 after markets close.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), an owner and operator of hotels and casino resorts, declined modestly in the most recent quarter, in part due to concerns about economic weakness in China.\n\nWe remain optimistic about the multi-year prospects for the company. We believe the ongoing re-emergence of business activity in Macau will drive additional shareholder value. If cash flow returns to the level achieved in 2019 prior to COVID-19, we believe Wynn’s shares will increase 30% to 50% higher than where they have recently traded.\n\nWe believe additional drivers for future value creation beyond a re-emergence in Macau business activity include: (i) our expectation for long-term growth opportunities in the company’s U.S.-centric markets of Las Vegas and Boston, including an expansion of Wynn’s Encore Boston Harbor resort; (ii) Wynn’s plans to develop an integrated resort in the United Arab Emirates with 1,500 hotel rooms and a casino that is similar in size to that of Encore Boston Harbor; (iii) opportunities to improve cash-flow margins by rightsizing labor and achieving lower staff costs in Macau; (iv) the possibility that Wynn is granted a New York casino license; and (v) an expansion in the company’s valuation multiple to levels achieved prior to the pandemic.”\n\n9. Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 47\n\nA caller reminded Jim Cramer during his program that he was bullish on Cloud software company Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA) last month. The stock is down about 3.3% over the past 30 days. The questioner asked whether Cramer is still bullish on the company.\n\n\"Oh am I ever, I think Okta is terrific.\"\n\nCramer also praised Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon and said that he was \"humbled\" by the hacking attack and \"learned\" from it. Cramer was referring to the attack on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in which hackers, according to the company, stole data of almost all users of its customer support system.\n\nMeridian Growth Fund made the following comment about Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the largest independent identity software company, serving enterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits, and government agencies across the globe. Its solutions provide higher-level security authentication services, a business-critical function that has the attention of CEOs and IT leaders everywhere. The company’s integration with 7,000 other software vendors and system providers is a competitive advantage that enables rapid and seamless implementations. Okta’s complete product suite allows customers to deploy an enterprise-wide identity platform that serves both the workforce segment (clients’ employees) and the customer segments (clients’ customers). The stock has started to recover after falling nearly 85% from post-COVID bubble levels due to a stabilization in the overall macro environment for security services. The company has also seen a normalization in salesforce attrition which had hampered growth. The stock moved higher during the quarter when it reported higher than expected revenues and a much-improved adjusted operating margin of 11% versus -3% in the prior year quarter. Beyond its core capabilities, which are in high demand, we are also encouraged by the company’s ability to expand into product adjacencies such as privileged access management and identity governance. Due to these improving fundamentals, we added to our position in the company during the period.”\n\n8. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nJim Cramer earlier this month hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), saying the stock is \"cheap.\" Cramer said Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) CEO Michael Dell is \"terrific.\" Cramer said Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) is a \"good stock to own\" and he wants people to buy it. In addition to DELL, he's also recommending Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 56 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL). The most notable stake in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) is owned by Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management which owns a $383 million stake in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL).\n\n7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). He said he \"likes Costco very much.\" Last month Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) upped its dividend by 13.7%. Jim Cramer praised this news and said the hike shows the stock has the potential to go higher.\n\n6. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 72\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA), saying HCA Healthcare Inc's (NYSE:HCA) latest quarter was \"good.\"\n\n\"I'm going to have to go with it. I know it's been uneven last year but it's been a great long-term horse.\"\n\nHCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) recently posted first quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $5.93. Revenue in the quarter jumped 11.2% year over year to $17.34 billion.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 72 hedge funds reported owning stakes in HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA).\n\nIn addition to HCA, investors are also watching Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We eliminated one position, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), during the quarter as the stock traded at our estimate of fair value. HCA was a very good investment and more than quadrupled from our original investment price in 2016. We believe HCA is a well-managed business with the best collection of assets in the hospital space. Hospital stocks tend to be much more volatile than their actual intrinsic value, and we would gladly purchase HCA again if the discount to value warrants.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Recommends 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest average salaries in Europe. We have also discussed why Americans find Europe attractive for relocation. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe.\n\nEurope has become a compelling destination for Americans that looking for relocation owing to obvious factors like quality of life, affordable housing, political stability, and remote work opportunities. However, moving to Europe's expensive cities can be a financial challenge, but for many Americans, the investment in quality of life pays off. In cities like Vienna, where childcare costs are significantly lower than in the US, families find raising children more manageable. While rent in European cities like Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Berlin can be steep, residents can not neglect the amazing benefits these regions have to offer.\n\nMoreover, Portugal is known to be one of the countries with high salary and low cost of living in Europe. On the other hand, Luxembourg is the country with the highest minimum wage in Europe, but it is still an expensive country to relocate to. To read about jobs and saalries in Europe, see the Most in Demand Jobs in Europe.\n\nSpeaking of minimum wages, in 2024, minimum wages across Europe vary significantly. Among the 27 EU member states, 22 have established a national minimum wage. However, Denmark, Italy, Austria, Finland, and Sweden do not enforce one. The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, including Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland, also lack a national minimum wage policy. Cyprus recently introduced a minimum wage, while eight out of ten candidate and potential candidate countries have established their own. To read more about minimum wages, see the 20 Countries with the Highest Minimum Wage in the World.\n\nDespite the establishment of minimum wages across the continent, the minimum wage disparity is stark, ranging from €477 ($481)  in Bulgaria to €2,571 ($2770)  in Luxembourg on a gross monthly basis. Notably, the minimum wage is above €2,000 ($2154) in Luxembourg, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany. Conversely, in 14 out of 22 EU member states with a minimum wage, it falls below €1,000 ($1077) per month. Adjusting for purchasing power standard (PPS) reveals a narrower range, with minimum wages ranging from €542 ($584) in Albania to €1,883 ($2028) in Germany.\n\nThe adequacy of minimum wages is a pressing concern, with ratios to median wages falling below 50% in ten EU countries in 2022. The EU's new directive aims to address this by setting a framework for regular revisions to ensure adequacy and protect the standard of living for low-paid workers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of adequacy, it is also interesting to note that more women are applying for jobs in Europe than in North America, with 52% of job applicants in the EMEA region being women, compared to 50% in North America, according to a March 2024 report from iCIMS. One factor contributing to the higher volume of female job applicants in Western Europe is the region's progressive stance on workplace gender balance. European employers have been actively implementing initiatives to close gender gaps, such as equal parental leave policies and accessible childcare services. These efforts have encouraged more women to seek employment opportunities, reflecting a cultural shift towards gender equality in the workforce.\n\nBefore getting into our list of the countries with the highest average salaries in Europe, let’s look at the recent developments observed by multinationals in Europe to truly understand the attractiveness of Europe for salaries and jobs in general.\n\nIn 2024, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is further expanding its European operations by investing over €700 million ($754.1 million) in robotics and AI-powered technologies for its fulfillment centers (FCs). With plans to introduce 120 new pieces of automation technology,  Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to revolutionize its European network. By the end of the year, the company's Innovation Lab, established in 2017, is set to oversee the installation of more than 1,000 new robotics systems to enhance efficiency and customer experience.\n\nThese cutting-edge technologies, including item sorters and automated guide vehicles, not only improve operational capabilities but also create new job opportunities.  Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported that these innovations had enhanced over 50,000 jobs in its FCs, providing employees with upskilling opportunities and a safer working environment. Furthermore,  Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Innovation Lab serves as a training center for robotics operators and a testing ground for start-ups receiving funding through the Amazon Industrial Innovation fund.\n\nOn the other hand, in January 2024, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced a major investment of $1 billion in a new data centre located in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, UK. This decision also highlights Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s commitment to supporting the digital economy of the UK and fostering innovation in AI-powered technologies. The 33-acre site not only promises to provide crucial compute capacity but also brings forth job opportunities for the local community, both in construction and technical roles. This investment aims to enhance the reliability of digital services for Google Cloud customers and users within the UK and beyond.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also committed to sustainability as it plans to operate all data centres and campuses on carbon-free energy by 2030. In alignment with this ambition,  Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced a power purchase agreement in 2022 for offshore wind energy generated by the Moray West wind farm in Scotland, which will contribute 100 MW of energy to the grid. Moreover, the new UK data centre will feature provisions for off-site heat recovery, presenting an opportunity for energy conservation and benefitting nearby homes and businesses.\n\nThis investment in the UK data centre is part of  Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s  broader commitment to the country and Europe in general. It follows previous investments such as the $1 billion purchase of the Central Saint Giles office in 2022 and the development in King's Cross. 15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe\n\n25 Safest Cities in Europe to Visit In 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the countries with the highest average salaries in Europe, we relied on our database of the highest average salary countries for different professions ranging from engineers to doctors to caregivers to bankers and even designers. We averaged the salaries of these professions for each European country and have now been listed below. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Italy\n\nAverage Salary: $43,920\n\nWhile Italy is known to pay high salaries, there still exists the gender wage gap of around 5%. Women represent only 42.8% of the workforce and have the lowest employment rate in the EU at 51.7%. Structural imbalances also persist as 60% of the pay gap arises from differing job roles within companies, and 40% from women being concentrated in lower-paying sectors.\n\nItaly is also one of the countries that produce the best fashion designers.\n\n14. United Kingdom\n\nAverage Salary: $44,323\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for the attractiveness of UK when it comes to salaries and jobs is its high foreign investment. In 2023, the UK saw a notable uptick in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), recording 985 projects. The UK's share of Europe's inward investment market grew to 17.3%, reflecting a significant rise from 2022's 15.6%. Despite some challenges, Greater London has been a primary beneficiary of investment growth, particularly in technology and financial services, becoming the leading European region for investment.\n\n13. Belgium\n\nAverage Salary: $45,348\n\nIn Belgium, the minimum wage has climbed to €2,029.88 ($2186) per month as of April 1st and hence,  it is now among the top five EU states with minimum wages surpassing €2,000 ($2154. This rise, coupled with a tax employment bonus boost, is set to positively impact around 80,000 low-income earners in 2024. It is one of the best-paying countries in Europe as it pays the some of the highest salaries to doctors, engineers, and lawyers.\n\n12. Netherlands\n\nAverage Salary: $45,870\n\nNetherlands is one of the countries with the highest average salaries in Europe per month. It is also interesting to note that the average gross hourly wage increased by 7% last year, marking the most substantial increase in 45 years, according to Statistics Netherlands. The Netherlands is also one of the highest paying countries for data scientists.\n\n11. Sweden\n\nAverage Salary: $46,020\n\nLabor unions negotiate for fair pay and good benefits for workers in the country. Plus, Sweden cares a lot about making sure everyone has equal opportunities, so workers are provided with healthcare and ample time off when they need it without compromising on wages. All of these things together help keep salaries high in the country. With an average salary of $46,020 and a high quality of life, Sweden is one of the countries in Europe that are the best to earn money.\n\n10. Austria\n\nAverage Salary: $46,379\n\nAustria's high salaries can be attributed to several factors like its highly stable economy driven by industries such as technology, finance, and tourism. Companies like Red Bull, Erste Group, and Voestalpine also contribute largely to the country's economic prosperity.\n\n9. Republic of Ireland\n\nAverage Salary: $48,887\n\nIn Ireland, the economy is projected to rebound with growth rates of 2.3% this year and 2.5% next year, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). However, challenges continue to stay as inflation and higher interest rates have dampened spending and investment, resulting in a mere 0.5% growth in modified domestic demand (MDD) last year.\n\n8. Finland\n\nAverage Salary: $49,613\n\nWith a focus on technology and research in Finland, sectors like IT, engineering, and healthcare thrive, offering ample employment opportunities. Additionally, Finland prioritizes work-life balance, providing generous benefits and flexible work arrangements.\n\n7. Monaco\n\nAverage Salary: $51,000\n\nSalaries in Monaco are exceptionally high primarily due to the Principality's strong economic performance as evident in its GDP figures. With a GDP of 8.34 billion (8.98 billion) Euros in 2022 with an 11.1% increase from the previous year, Monaco's economic growth surpasses global and French averages.\n\n6. Iceland\n\nAverage Salary: $52,440\n\nWith an average salary of $52,440, Iceland is one of the top 10 countries with the highest average salaries in Europe. The country has a highly strong economy supported by industries like fishing, tourism, and renewable energy.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 worst states to work in the US. We have also discussed the state of labor unions and occupational fatal rates in the US that have direct implications for workers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Worst States to Work in the US.\n\nIn 2022, the United States witnessed 5,486 fatal work injuries with a 5.7% increase from the previous year. This equated to a worker dying approximately every 96 minutes due to a work-related injury, highlighting a concerning trend. Violence and other injuries by persons or animals increased by 11.6%, with homicides accounting for a significant portion of these fatalities, representing an 8.9% increase from the previous year. Furthermore, unintentional overdoses reached a series high of 525 fatalities, reflecting a continuing trend of annual increases since 2012.\n\nTransportation incidents remained the most frequent type of fatal event, constituting 37.7% of all occupational fatalities. Workers in transportation and material moving occupations experienced the highest number of fatal work injuries in 2022, followed closely by construction and extraction workers. Despite consecutive increases in 2021 and 2022, transportation incidents were still down 2.6 percent from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. However, roadway incidents involving motorized land vehicles reached a series high.\n\nIn 2023, the United States witnessed a concerning trend in labor union membership, with rates hitting record lows despite headline-grabbing strikes across various sectors. Despite efforts to bolster membership, the union membership rate dropped to 10.0%, down from the previous record low of 10.1% in 2022. However, the number of union members increased slightly to 14.4 million, although this growth was overshadowed by the overall rise in employment among wage and salary workers. This decline in membership rates underscores a broader challenge facing organized labor in the country.\n\nWhile there were some successes in union organizing, particularly among people of color, the private sector continues to face issues. Private-sector union membership remained stagnant at a record-low 6%, indicating ongoing difficulties in organizing efforts. Additionally, the erosion of the wage premium traditionally enjoyed by union members is a cause for concern. Over the years, the weekly pay gap between union and non-union workers has narrowed, highlighting the changing dynamics of the labor market and the challenges faced by unions in negotiating favorable terms for their members. To read more about unions, see States That Have America’s Strongest Unions.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these challenges, unions still wield political influence, particularly in key states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. However, declining membership rates and ongoing struggles to maintain wage premiums suggest a need for labor unions to adapt to changing economic realities and employer tactics. The surge in strikes and organizing efforts in 2023 demonstrates a growing discontent among workers, but the effectiveness of these actions in reversing the decline in union membership remains uncertain.\n\nTo read more about the best states for jobs, see the best states for job seekers right now. It is also worth highlighting that California and New York are known to be two of the best states in USA for working whereas Utah and Massachusetts are popular to be two of the best states to live in the US.\n\nLet’s talk about companies that are providing several career opportunities in 2024.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently announced the opening of applications for its 2024 grants through the Amazon Literary Partnership. Since its establishment, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been instrumental in supporting writers and their narratives. The Literary Partnership, established in 2009, has disbursed over $16 million in grants, aiding authors in various stages of their careers. In 2023 alone, they provided close to $1 million in funding to 93 literary organizations across the United States. These grants aim to empower writers by facilitating publication opportunities, educational initiatives, and platforms for diverse voices in storytelling.\n\nFurthermore, the Amazon Literary Partnership collaborates with esteemed organizations such as the Academy of American Poets and the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP) to administer grants like the Poetry Fund and the Literary Magazine Fund. These partnerships reflect Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s promise to support a vibrant literary landscape by supporting organizations that champion underrepresented authors and storytellers. Applications for the 2024 grants are open until April 15, offering opportunities for nonprofit literary organizations to secure funding and continue their invaluable work in the literary community.\n\nOn the other hand, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is embarking on an ambitious expansion plan that will largely impact employment opportunities across America. Over the next five years, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) aims to build or convert more than 150 stores, creating hundreds of jobs with each new store opening. Additionally, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) plans to remodel 650 existing locations in the next 12 months alone, a decision that will generate tens of thousands of jobs to support these renovation projects. With approximately 1.6 million people already employed directly by Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) in the United States, these initiatives are set to further increase job creation and economic growth in communities nationwide. 15 Worst States to Work in the US\n\nNEstudio/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nWe've compiled a list of the 15 worst states to work in the United States, utilizing two primary metrics. Firstly, we considered the union affiliation rank, which was determined by the percentage of employed individuals represented by unions. These percentages were sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the lowest percentage receiving a rank of 1. Secondly, we incorporated fatality ranks of workers in each state, based on data from AdvisorSmith’s report, where the highest fatality rate was assigned a rank of 1. By averaging these ranks, we obtained an overall average rank for each state, with the list arranged in ascending order.\n\nThe choice of these metrics was based on their direct impact on the working conditions and safety of employees within each state. Union affiliation rates reflect the level of collective bargaining power and protection afforded to workers, while fatality rates provide insight into the overall safety measures and workplace conditions within a state. By considering both factors, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the challenges and risks faced by workers across different states.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Tennessee\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 14\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 21\n\nAverage Rank: 17.5\n\nRecently, teenagers as young as 14 were found working in harsh conditions at a factory in Tennessee. The Labor Department's investigation at the Tuff Torq facility in Talbott revealed a disturbing case of child labor. Ten young immigrants were discovered working in unsafe environments. This highlights not only the exploitation of vulnerable immigrant groups but also the larger issue of inadequate labor regulation and enforcement, especially in states like Tennessee, which are known for their poor worker protections.\n\n14. Utah\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 4\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 31\n\nAverage Rank: 17.5\n\nOne of the reasons why Utah is considered one of the least desirable states to live in is because of its refusal to guarantee equal pay for employees with disabilities. Recently, lawmakers rejected a proposal requiring employers to pay at least minimum wage to such workers, leaving around 600 Utahns with disabilities earning less than minimum wage, according to federal records. Under the 14(c) program, many affected workers receive less than $3.50 per hour, with no mandated minimum wage.\n\n13. Lowa\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 19\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 15\n\nAverage Rank: 17\n\nIn Iowa, the struggle of low-wage workers is a stark reality. Back in 1987, the federal minimum wage was $3.35 per hour, barely reaching $7,000 annually before taxes, while the poverty line for a family of four was $11,611. Fast forward to today, the federal minimum wage remains stagnant at $7.25 since 2009, with the poverty line at $18,595.\n\n12. Georgia\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 10\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 22\n\nAverage Rank: 16\n\nThe Georgia Senate passed a budget, 53-1, allocating $36.1 billion in state funds and $61 billion overall for the upcoming fiscal year. This was a decrease from the current year's budget, which was supplemented by one-time cash injections, raising it to $38 billion. Nevertheless, public school teachers are set to receive a $2,500 raise effective July 1, alongside a $1,000 bonus distributed in December.\n\n11. Virginia\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 7\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 24\n\nAverage Rank: 15.5\n\nIn 2021, Virginia reported a total of 125 fatal occupational injuries, with transportation incidents being the leading cause, accounting for 26 incidents, followed by violence and other injuries by persons or animals at 39 incidents. Falls, slips, and trips resulted in one fatality, while exposure to harmful substances or environments and contact with objects and equipment contributed to 21 and 18 fatalities, respectively.\n\n10. Oklahoma\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 16\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 11\n\nAverage Rank: 13.5\n\nIn 2022, Oklahoma reported a total of 70 fatal occupational injuries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similar to Virginia, transportation incidents comprised the highest proportion at 30 incidents, followed by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. Falls, slips, and trips accounted for 12 fatalities, while exposure to harmful substances or environments resulted in 6 deaths.\n\n9. North Carolina\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 2\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 25\n\nAverage Rank: 13.5\n\nNorth Carolina is one of the hardest states to get a job in as the struggle to fill job positions continues to persist, ranking 10th nationally for hiring difficulty. With a job openings rate of 6.50% in the latest month and 6.86% over the past 12 months, the state faces challenges despite a fluctuating unemployment rate.\n\n8. Mississippi\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 18\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 6\n\nAverage Rank: 12\n\nMississippi ranks among the most dangerous states for workers owing to its alarming health crisis. With the second shortest life expectancy in the country and high rates of chronic illnesses, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease, Mississippians face major health risks.\n\nMississipi is also known to be one of the hardest states to get a job in.\n\n7. Louisiana\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 6\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 13\n\nAverage Rank: 9.5\n\nThe issue of gender pay disparity in Louisiana persists, with women earning largely less than men. Despite efforts like the Louisiana Equal Pay for Women Act, which aimed to address this gap, private businesses remain unaffected. Recent studies highlight a $14,048 annual difference between genders in the state, placing Louisiana fifth in the country for wage inequality and hence, making it one of the top 10 worst states to work in the US.\n\nTo read more about wage disparity, see the States With Biggest Gender Wage Gaps.\n\n6. Arkansas\n\nUnion Affiliation Rank: 12\n\nFatality Rate Rank: 7\n\nAverage Rank: 9.5\n\nUnemployment claims in Arkansas saw an uptick last week, as reported by the US Department of Labor. Initial filings rose to 1,484, compared to 1,313 the previous week, indicating potential layoffs. Owing to the rising unemployment, it is one of the hardest states to live in financially.\n\nClick here to see the 5 Worst States to Work in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Hardest Working Countries in Asia 15 States With the Highest Number of Remote Workers in 2024 25 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Women in the Workforce\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Worst States to Work in the US is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.54 points to a change of +56.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +14.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +27.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMZN _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $638.26 billion and $709.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Top Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "If you're looking for quality stocks to hold for the long haul that also offer near-term return potential, you're in the right place. There are several outstanding companies that are coming off a challenging year but are starting to turn the corner, and their share prices are responding.\n\nA team of Motley Fool contributors see positive momentum building at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walt Disney(NYSE: DIS), and Coupang(NYSE: CPNG). Here's why they believe now is a great time to buy these stocks.\n\nAmazon just reported record profits\n\nJohn Ballard (Amazon): Amazon has been a rewarding investment for many years. The stock would have turned a $1,000 investment 10 years ago into $11,000 today. Amazon just posted first-quarter revenue growth of 13% year over year, which shows it still has a lot of opportunities to expand the business and create returns for shareholders.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce business is not growing as fast as it was five years ago, but management is doing a great job improving efficiency and delivering goods faster to customers. This helped drive a record operating profit last quarter of $15 billion.\n\nImportantly, these record profits will give management greater resources to invest in the technology infrastructure to grow its lucrative cloud services business. Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue accelerated 17% year over year in the quarter, thanks to growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\nIt can't be emphasized enough what Amazon's improving retail profits means for the future. Improving inventory efficiency has helped Amazon generate $50 billion in free cash flow over the last year. With more cash flow coming in the door, management plans to \"meaningfully increase\" capital spending in 2024 to support growing demand in AWS.\n\nThe ability to grow profits while investing for the future is why the stock will likely hit new highs in 2024 and remain a great investment for years to come.\n\nAll of Disney's parts are starting to work together again\n\nJennifer Saibil (Disney): Disney has struggled through several years of challenges, and its stock price reflects that -- it's down 40% over the past three years. But things have started to turn around, and Disney stock is up 23% this year as investors gain some confidence.\n\nOne big factor is the return of former CEO Bob Iger. During his previous tenure, Disney made some major moves that propelled it to the powerhouse entertainment company it is today, including the acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel Studios. These provide it with more of the unmatched assets that it turns into sequels, theme park attractions, products, and sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nParks and experiences, which were crushed under the weight of pandemic closures, are now back to high demand and strong momentum. It was the company's best-performing segment by sales growth in the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 30), increasing 7% year over year. Disney's 12 theme parks are unparalleled globally, and they're a major element of the Disney magic that brings in fans and dollars. Iger said the company would invest $60 billion in parks development over the next 10 years.\n\nProbably the main reason investors are getting more excited, though, is that Disney's streaming efforts are getting very close to profitability. After bleeding cash for the past few years, it reported a major improvement in efficiency, with a $138 million operating loss in the first quarter vs. $984 million the year before. It recently launched an ad-supported tier for Disney+, and it's expecting 5.5 million to 6 million new Disney+ subscriptions in the second quarter. Management expects streaming to become profitable in the fourth quarter, which is just a few months away.\n\nThere have been other positive updates as well. Disney announced a partnership with several other networks to create a fully loaded sports streaming network that will finally answer the question of what to do about ESPN, which Disney hasn't been able to offload from cable to streaming effectively. It also reinstated its dividend, which had been suspended since 2020, in November.\n\nDisney reports second-quarter earnings on May 7, and if it demonstrates further progress its stock will keep climbing.\n\nE-commerce is coming back\n\nJeremy Bowman (Coupang): Amazon's recent earnings report shows there's plenty of growth left in e-commerce around the world. The tech giant just reported double-digit revenue growth in both its North America and International e-commerce segments, reflecting solid demand.\n\nThat should bode well for other e-commerce stocks, including Coupang, which is following a similar playbook to Amazon in South Korea. Now could be a great buying opportunity for the stock, as it's down 67% from its peak after its IPO in 2021.\n\nWhile long-term investors may be disappointed in the stock's performance so far, Coupang is showing signs of turning the corner. The company just raised the price of its Prime-like Rocket Wow membership subscription from $3.60/month to $5.70/month, a move that should expand margins and enable the company to invest in newer parts of the business like food delivery and video streaming. It's also investing in AI, as it has autonomous robots that help with picking and packing.\n\nCoupang is set to report first-quarter results on May 7, and the news could set the tone for a long-term recovery in the stock as it expands with new businesses in Korea and looks to expand outside of its home country.\n\nThere are a number of other attributes that make Coupang attractive. Unlike a number of other e-commerce companies, it's solidly profitable. In 2023, it reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.1 billion on revenue of $24.4 billion, and had an adjusted net income of $465 million.\n\nCoupang also looks like a good value for its growth potential, as it trades a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 30. Keep an eye on the earnings report next week, as the stock could soar on good news.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The stock market was happy to put April behind it. The S&P 500 ended the month 1.6% lower. Will May be any better? A lot depends on the path the Federal Reserve takes on interest rates. While multiple rate cuts are no longer in the cards, any glimmer of hope could send stocks soaring. Inflation continuing to rise, on the other hand, would be a sure-fire damper. This led us to create this list of the hottest S&P 500 stocks.\n\nStill, the broad-based index is up 5% this year and almost half of its constituent components performed as well or better than the average.\n\nThe following three companies are the hottest S&P 500 stocks on the market, significantly outperforming the index. Should you back up the truck or take money off the table? Let’s dive in to see?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt might be a little confusing for investors to see the GE ticker symbol but see the company name GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE). That’s because the old General Electric split itself into two separately traded companies. One was the aerospace division, which retained the legacy ticker, and the renewable energy business was renamed GE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) and got a new ticker symbol (GEV). The old GE that people knew is no more.\n\nHowever, as investors prepared for a different kind of halving event, GE stock soared. Shares are up 59.8% in 2024, good enough for a third-place showing.\n\nGE Aerospace had $32 billion in revenue last year with 70% generated by services. It starts its new life as an independent company with an installed base of 44,000 commercial engines and 26,000 military and defense engines globally. GE Aerospace believes it can achieve $10 billion in operating profit by 2028.\n\nGeneral Electric was founded in 1892 as the merger between Thomas Edison’s Edison General Electric and two other electric companies. It eventually grew into a major industrial conglomerate. But over the years it divested many of its businesses and today has a different purpose and trajectory ahead of it.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot surprising to many, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be a massive growth story. Shares are up 69.5% this year, continuing to pad the lead it posted in 2023. The chipmaker is powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and though it is down from the all-time highs hit last month, the market still expects Nvidia stock to grow further this year.\n\nFourth quarter revenue was $22.1 billion, a 265% from the year-ago figure and well ahead of management’s forecast of $20 billion. That was due to companies building next-gen data centers, or what Nvidia calls “AI factories.” It now expects Q1 revenue to be $24 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there is a good chance investors will experience a lot more volatility with the stock. Rockets like the chipmaker will run into instances when it just can’t keep up with demand and those shortfalls will wreak havoc around earnings time. The business remains solid but because expectations of peak performance are built into the stock price, anything even slightly underwhelming will send shares lower.\n\nNvidia is priced for perfection. At 69 times trailing earnings and 34 times sales, NVDA stock is not cheap. That doesn’t mean it is a bad company, but you may wish to find other opportunities that offer better valuations or smoother forward progress.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to see an overreaction, look at what’s happening to Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). While it is still the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 with shares soaring 149% in 2024, that was after a 17% pullback in the stock after “missing” earnings.\n\nMind you, Super Micro’s revenues tripled in its fiscal third quarter while profits quadrupled from last year. But because Wall Street was looking for even greater sales, the stock plummeted on the news.\n\nThat is the type of situation investors should pounce on. It is obvious the maker of AI-optimized servers, storage and equipment for data centers is on fire with more demand for its product than it knows what to do with. That is blistering growth that should not have been punished.\n\nThere is no let up in demand for data centers. Not even if the economy were to fall into a recession would the demand ebb. Hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are undergoing a demand wave themselves and are building out their own data center footprint. Because Super Micro’s equipment is essential to their proper working, look for its stock to quickly regain the lost ground and advance once again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Play Likely Earnings Beat With These 5 Top-Ranked Stocks",
        "content": "It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality.\n\nIn this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Amazon.com AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS, Alaska Air Group ALK and DocuSign DOCU as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.\n\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\n\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\n\nHow to Find Stocks That Can Beat?\n\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\n\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.\n\nLast EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.\n\nIn addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.\n\nEarnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.\n\nIn order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:\n\nNext 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.\n\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.\n\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only nine.\n\nHere are five out of nine stocks:\n\nAmazon.com: The Zacks Rank #2 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon's online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by its massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. The average earnings surprise of AMZN for the past four quarters is 48.17%.\n\nNVIDIA: The Zacks Rank #2 company is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.\n\nOver the years, NVIDIA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. The average earnings surprise of NVDA for the past four quarters is 20.18%.\n\nZscaler: The company is one of the world’s leading providers of cloud-based security solutions. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nZscaler offers a full range of enterprise network security services, including web security, Internet security, antivirus, vulnerability management, firewalls, and control over user activity in mobile, cloud computing, and Internet of things environments. The average earnings surprise of ZS for the past four quarters is 28.17%.\n\nAlaska Air Group: The Zacks Rank #2 airline company, together with its partner regional carriers, serves more than 120 cities across North America. Alaska Air Group also offers passenger and cargo services to/within Alaska.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of ALK for the past four quarters is 22.68%.\n\nDocuSign: The Zacks Rank #2 company is a global provider of cloud-based software. DocuSign’s anchor product eSignature helps businesses prepare, sign, act on and manage agreements digitally. Contract Lifecycle Management automates workflows across the agreement process. Insight scouts and analyzes agreements by legal concepts and clauses using artificial intelligence, and Analyzer analyzes inbound agreements by detecting clauses by type, scoring their risk and extracting important terms.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of DOCU for the past four quarters is 23.72%.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "Time to Cut Your Losses on SOFI Stock? Why This Former Bull Is Waving the White Flag.",
        "content": "I was wrong about SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock. After three years of waiting for a return on my investment, I sold my shares recently, at a loss.\n\nThe stock currently sells at about $7/share. If you got in a year ago, when it traded near $5, you’re in great shape. But I’d still recommend you sell it.\n\nHere’s why.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoFi Stock and Consumer Banking\n\nSoFi has evolved into a consumer bank. Its main business is taking deposits and making loans, for houses, for education, and for other life expenses.\n\nThis can be a good business. It’s certainly growing for SoFi. SoFi revenues last year passed $2.1 billion. They were $1.57 billion in 2022, and under $1 billion the year before that.\n\nThe problem is that SoFi continues to lose money, because SoFi wants to be much more than a consumer bank.\n\nAs I wrote last November, it offers banking software through Technisys, banking services through Galileo, and automates risk management through Konecta.\n\nIt competes with Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) in brokerage. CEO Anthony Noto talks of it becoming a “10-bagger,” delivering 10-for-1 returns to investors.\n\nI bought this hook, line, and sinker. I defended the company after bad earnings last year, when it fell from $10/share to $8.\n\nBut it’s still just a bank. Banks are defined by their “yield spread,” the difference between what they pay for money and what they rent it for.\n\nBut SoFi’s spread is narrower than the big banks it competes with. That’s because it’s paying depositors 4.5% for their money, with no account fees.\n\nBanking Breaking Bad\n\nI wasn’t just wrong on SoFi. I was wrong about the whole banking sector.\n\nI figured that once money started costing money, as it does now, selling money should be a great business. But banks are leveraged. They compete with private equity companies that aren’t.\n\nBanks face regulation private lenders don’t. They also hold reserves against deposits, whose return could be lower than what’s needed to run the business. Watch those maturities!\n\nAgainst this backdrop, SoFi is also taking low-quality credits. I love millennials and have two of my own. But lending to low net-worth borrowers carries risk. SoFi reported 4.8% of its loans were in default at the end of March.\n\nSoFi keeps seeking new niches that might offer a greater return. Buying Wyndham Capital last year got it into home loans, but it hasn’t expanded that niche. Its growth in the March quarter was still in personal loans.\n\nThat’s why professional money managers have soured on SoFi. Tipranks now has just as many buyers as sellers, 4, with eight on the fence.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders at Stocktwits remain bullish, copying Noto’s statements like he’s Warren Buffett of Berkshire-Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). He’s not.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t make money in SoFi stock right now. The stock might even go up from here. The question is how much you might make and whether that is worth your time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWatching TV analyst Jim Cramer’s contortions over the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) quarter, I was reminded of an old investment aphorism. Not all good companies are good investments.\n\nSoFi is a good company. Noto is a good operator. In the present economic cycle, it’s just not a great investment.\n\nThere’s always an opportunity cost in what you own. I decided my money could be doing something else. I could own Amazon. Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIf you insist on owning banks, buy JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). If you really need diversification, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) isn’t a bad bet.\n\nBut you learn to pull the plug on what doesn’t work. Selling is the hardest lesson investors learn. Not everything works. SoFi didn’t.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN, NVDA, and PEP.

        "title": "3 Surprising Reasons Investors Should Buy Amazon Stock Right Now",
        "content": "As far as quarterly results go, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) shareholders have nothing to complain about right now. The e-commerce giant's first-quarter revenue of $143.3 billion and per-share earnings of $0.98 both topped estimates and were well up from year-ago levels. Amazon stock edged higher following Tuesday evening's release of the company's first-quarter report. Chalk up another win for all the obvious reasons.\n\nHowever, there are some less obvious reasons to buy Amazon stock that further bolster the already bullish case here.\n\n1. Amazon Web Services is becoming much more cost-efficient\n\nPerhaps one of Amazon's most exciting growth engines at this time is its cloud computing arm. Indeed, Amazon Web Services (or AWS) has grown at a double-digit pace for several years now. This business ran into an alarming wall beginning in mid-2022, though, thanks to the steep costs of operating a cloud computing arm in an environment rife with inflation. AWS's operating income and operating margin rates have been weak since 2022, even though its cloud revenue has continued to grow.\n\nThis all seems to have dramatically changed last quarter, however. Following the slight turnaround that started taking shape in the third quarter of last year, AWS's operating margin jumped to a record-breaking 37.6% during the first quarter of this year. Data source: Amazon Inc. Chart by author. All dollar figures are in billions.\n\nDeliberate cost-containment certainly helped. There's also the benefit of inflation that's at least starting to level off. Then there's the benefit of scale. That is to say, the bigger this business gets, the more cost-efficiently it can be managed.\n\nWhatever the reason(s), given that Amazon Web Services accounts for nearly two-thirds of Amazon's operating income, these widening profit margins are a pretty big -- and encouraging -- deal.\n\n2. E-commerce is (finally) a business well worth running\n\nIt's curious. In Amazon's infancy, it was far more concerned with expanding its reach than turning a profit. And investors were OK with the idea. The company never seemed interested in turning up the heat on its bottom-line growth, though -- not even when it arguably could have. Shareholders became so accustomed to its thin profit margins that they never really pressed the issue either.\n\nWell, lo and behold (and without a great deal of fanfare), Amazon's e-commerce operations are finally turning a surprisingly wide profit. After record-breaking fourth-quarter operating income, its Q1 e-commerce operating income of $5.9 billion is another record-breaker for the calendar quarter in question. That's impressive, given how inflation has been a problem for corporations and consumers alike.\n\nStory continues Data source: Amazon Inc. Chart by author. All figures are in billions.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling data offered up in the chart above, however, is that Amazon's international e-commerce business is turning profitable again, even though this arm has seen minimal revenue growth since the pandemic-prompted surge. This will help justify the company's continued investment in its overseas operations, where the bulk of its future growth will lie; the North American market is pretty well saturated.\n\n3. Advertising and subscription revenue is soaring\n\nBut why is Amazon's e-commerce business suddenly so profitable? Greater scale and improved efficiency are certainly factors. However, the business is also evolving. Amazon.com is becoming less of a mere online mall and more of an advertising platform.\n\nOh, it's almost always been one, for the record. That is to say, third-party sellers have long been able to pay to have their products more prominently featured on the website. Over the course of just the past few years, though, it's turned up the heat in this business. Last quarter's advertising revenue of $11.8 billion is 24% better than the year-earlier comparison, extending a well-established growth trend. This is high-margin revenue, too. Data source: Amazon Inc. Chart by author. All figures are in billions of dollars.\n\nThe other data set displayed on the chart above maps the growth of Amazon's subscription businesses. This is predominantly revenue generated by subscriptions to Amazon Prime but can also include other subscription-based services, like digital music or grocery delivery. Last quarter's subscription revenue reached a record-breaking $10.7 billion, up 11% year over year.\n\nThis continued growth is no small matter, but not necessarily for the reason you might think. It's not so much about that revenue. These subscribers are known to spend more with Amazon than non-subscribers do. This rising figure simply says the company is adding more fruitful customers to its active-customer headcount.\n\nAll of it makes Amazon stock an even better buy\n\nThese aren't the only reasons to own Amazon stock, of course. The bigger, more obvious ones are still in place. These include the company's dominance of the e-commerce market and its ongoing expansion. Amazon Web Services is also a compelling business, regardless of whether its profit margins are improving.\n\nNevertheless, these details do make the already solid bullish arguments even better. Amazon is handling the big things and the little things well, capitalizing on its unique strengths, like its sheer size and technological capabilities. Few other companies are ever going to be able to match either.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge",
        "content": "Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up.\n\nSo does the rest of Silicon Valley.\n\nA landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.\n\nGoogle's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: \"Google is winning because it’s better,\" he said.\n\nA government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court on Oct. 30, in Washington, D.C., after testifying in the antitrust case against his company. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nThat's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.\n\nIn Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.”\n\nA similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance.\n\n\"The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,\" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross.\n\n\"I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,\" Ross added, \"and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.\"\n\nThe government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.\n\nGenerally, Ross said, prosecutors are inclined to craft narrower market definitions to make it easier to prove a defendant holds a monopoly.\n\nHow courts react to those arguments, he added, will be significant.\n\nNew York University Law professor Harry First said the impact of Google's case also depends on the extent to which the judge accepts or rejects one of the government’s antitrust theories — that Google’s collective actions qualify as anticompetitive.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat strategy has been unsuccessful for the DOJ so far, including in its landmark case in the 1990s that eventually forced Microsoft (MSFT) into a settlement to open its operating system to competitors in the early 2000s. Amit Mehta, left, is the judge overseeing the Google antitrust case. Here he is pictured in 2012 when he was an attorney before the New York State Supreme Court. (DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\nBut if the judge in the Google case is persuaded that the theory has some merit, First explained, it could alter the way future antitrust cases are evaluated.\n\n\"I'm curious to see the extent to which the government tries to return to that theme and maybe move it in a direction that could be useful in other cases,\" First said.\n\nMany companies could be impacted by what the judge decides, even beyond the world of tech.\n\nA government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.\n\nThe government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\nGovernment prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.\n\nIn 2022, according to prosecutors, those payments totaled roughly $20 billion. The DOJ said its figure represented 15%-20% of Apple’s worldwide net income. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in April. (REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nSome tech companies, however, stand to gain if the government ultimately prevails.\n\nA breakup of Google’s contractual arrangements could boost rival search engines like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo.\n\nIt could also open the door to newcomer search engines and mobile manufacturers.\n\nAmazon, for its part, exited the mobile phone market after Google's contracts allegedly prevented it from attracting manufacturers to its alternative operating system, Fire OS, a competing \"fork\" to Google’s Android operating system.\n\nProsecutors said manufacturers were concerned that Amazon's partnership with Bing for mobile search services would risk lucrative deals with Google.\n\nThe government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google.

        "title": "E-commerce is witnessing the Amazon-ification of Shein, as the fast-fashion behemoth woos skincare and toy brands",
        "content": "E-commerce giant Shein is spreading its arms to envelope more than just the fashion and apparel for which it’s known—and it’s starting to look like another familiar online market platform in the process.\n\nShein is wooing brands such as household goods conglomerate Colgate-Palmolive, toy maker Hasbro, and skincare brands to sell their products in its marketplace, Reuters reported Tuesday. The company, known for affordable and stylish clothes—albeit made with concerns about labor practices and its environmental impact—is taking steps to create a platform that is everything to everyone.\n\n\"Everybody associates Shein with fashion, but we are doing all verticals,\" Christina Fontana, Shein’s senior director of brand operations for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said at a Paris conference on April 17, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Our consumers want brands, [so] if that's what they're looking for, that's what we're going to give them,” she added.\n\nShein’s outward expansion is a clear tactic to take a bigger piece of the e-commerce pie, Steve Tadelis, economic analysis and policy professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told Fortune.\n\nShein has the largest fast-fashion market share in the U.S, and its annual profit doubled to $2 billion in 2023 from the year before. It's eyeing an IPO and a whopping $90 billion valuation. While the size of its retail empire still pales in comparison to Amazon’s stranglehold on 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, Tadelis said Shein will want to go after the industry leader.\n\n“It shouldn't be surprising that with all of the regulators around the world and talking about the Amazon monopoly that needs to be reined in, well, Shein is now taking a bite out of their apple and will probably take more of those bites,” he said.\n\nShein’s big wins\n\nShein, a China-based fast-fashion platform founded by billionaire Sky Xu in 2008, has skyrocketed to success and 45 million monthly users through its massive and efficient production and distribution strategies.\n\nUsing AI and electronic monitoring, Shein is able to identify online trends, turn to its suppliers to manufacture small batches of products, then take initial sales data to decide to mass produce a product. The system nearly guarantees the company has its finger on the pulse of trends and can deliver goods fast, though it’s gotten into hot water over allegations of copyright infringement and data scraping, as well as the proliferation of counterfeit product listings.\n\nEven as regulatory bodies, like the European Union’s European Commission, have tried to put checks and balances on the company to stymie its questionable business practices, Shein may have found a way around that.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Deighton, professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School, told Fortune that Shein’s strategy of incorporating more brand names onto its platform will only help the company dodge increased attention: The site could soon be flooded with thousands of listings from familiar and trusted products, such as Colgate toothpaste and Play-Doh, essentially telling regulatory bodies there’s nothing to see here.\n\n“They won't get caught up by the scrutiny,” Deighton said.\n\nButting heads with Amazon\n\nShein’s behind-the-scenes methodology makes expanding beyond fashion a natural next step, Tadelis argued. With an efficient infrastructure in place, Shein is able to be more nimble in expanding outward from apparel.\n\n“I really think this is a smart business decision of saying, ‘We have an amazing logistics network, let's start expanding it into other areas where we could procure cheap products,’” he added.\n\nRui Ma, tech analyst and COO of market research platform AlphaWatch.AI, told Fortune that Shein’s secure spot in apparel offers another advantage in its race to beat Amazon. Fashion is a notoriously finicky sector, and Amazon, despite dipping its toe into the world of apparel, hasn’t been able to see the same success as Shein, Ma said.\n\n“It's been very—historically—very difficult to match up demand supply,” she said. “It's not been a particularly easy category.”\n\nBut as Shein takes pages out of Amazon’s playbook, Amazon is simultaneously doing the same to Shein. Amazon announced last December it would slash seller fees from 17% to 5% for apparel under $15, with apparel between $15 to $20 triggering a 10% fee, starting in January. The company said on Monday its packages are getting delivered faster than ever: 60% of orders placed in 60 major U.S. cities arrived the same day or day after the order was placed. According to the company, that's part of its longstanding efforts to stay on top of the e-commerce market and tend to customer needs. Shein customers may have to wait 14 days for their orders to arrive.\n\nTadelis believes this is par for the course. Just as in most markets, company philosophies start to converge on each other when one finds an effective formula.\n\n“There's no surprise that these things are looking more alike,” he said. “Because once there's a good, winning strategy … then you're going to see imitators.”\n\nFor the consumer, there will certainly appear to be copycatting and similarities in promotions and perks across e-commerce platforms. But Ma said, don’t be fooled by Shein’s bid to mime its competitors. The site might start to look a lot like Amazon in its offerings, but behind the scenes, it’s very much sticking with its unique logistics network.\n\n“It might feel the same to us as consumers. It's going to become more of an everything store,” she told Fortune. “But how it builds that experience, I think the logic is very different from Amazon.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Could Crush the Market for the Rest of the Year",
        "content": "Don't blink; it's May already.\n\n2024 is quickly approaching the halfway point, and Wall Street has been up and down, especially in recent weeks. It could be a good time to regroup and consider the market's best ideas for the second half of the year.\n\nThree Fool.com contributors did just that and came up with three dynamic artificial intelligence (AI) names: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), UiPath(NYSE: PATH), and Monday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY) as top ideas.\n\nHere is the pitch for why each stock could crush the broader market over the next seven months.\n\nAmazon is picking up steam, and its stock is soaring higher\n\nJake Lerch (Amazon): That's right, Amazon is the AI stock that I think is set to crush the market for the rest of this year. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, Amazon has already crushed the stock market. The stock has generated a 67% total return over the last 12 months, compared to a 23% total return for the S&P 500. That's quite impressive, but it's possible Amazon could do even better than that 3-to-1 trouncing of the benchmark index thanks to what was revealed in its most recent earnings report.\n\nThe company's most recent earnings results (for the three months ended on March 31, 2024) blew away expectations. Highlights from that report include:\n\n$143 billion in total revenue, a 13% year-over-year increase. $10.4 billion in net income, up from $3.2 billion a year earlier. $50.1 billion in positive free cash flow versus a $3.3 billion outflow one year ago.\n\nIn short, Amazon has transformed into a cash-printing machine, thanks to the cost cuts implemented by CEO Andy Jassy. Better yet, those cuts haven't eroded the company's revenue growth. In fact, revenue growth has accelerated in the face of Jassy's stricter expense management.\n\nAmazon's advertising unit is leading the way. The division, often underappreciated by some investors, is quickly becoming a significant player in the digital advertising market. In its most recent quarter, Amazon's ad business generated $11.8 billion in revenue, up 24% year over year.\n\nNext, there's Amazon's cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's crown jewel. Its sales growth accelerated to 17%, with quarterly revenue hitting $25 billion, helped, in part, by its AI initiatives.\n\nIn short, Amazon's key growth drivers are firing on all cylinders just as the savings from its massive cost-cutting regime are kicking in. And that is why Amazon is poised to keep trouncing the overall market for the rest of the year.\n\nThis robotics stock is on a \"path\" to yearly gains\n\nWill Healy(UiPath): UiPath stock has languished since it took a beating in the 2022 bear market. However, 2024 could be the year its recovery finally takes off in earnest.\n\nStory continues\n\nUiPath specializes in robotic process automation (RPA) software for handling repetitive tasks. It stands out by offering end-to-end automation, integrating robotics with enterprise applications and products utilizing application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\nNot surprisingly, AI plays a critical role in these applications. UiPath has applied the technology to discover excellent opportunities to improve return on investment (ROI). AI also aids in rapidly deploying task automation solutions and providing a foundation to scale customer operations.\n\nMoreover, the robotics stock stands out over competitors by supporting a community of developers who create and share applications with one another. This increases the software's utilization and provides a meaningful disincentive to turn to a competing product.\n\nUiPath's successes have prompted 2,054 large customers to spend $100,000 or more on UiPath products, a 15% surge from the previous year. This includes 288 customers who spend $1 million or more annually.\n\nWith that increase, the company continued to grow its revenue. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), revenue of $1.3 billion rose 24% from year-ago levels. This included a dollar-based net retention rate of 119%, meaning long-term customers spent 19% more on the platform on average than in the previous year.\n\nThe higher revenue reduced its fiscal 2024 loss to $90 million, an improvement over the $328 million loss in the previous year. Also, the fact that net income was $34 million in fiscal Q4 indicates it is within striking distance of annual profitability on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.\n\nFurthermore, these improvements have come even though UiPath stock has barely begun to recover from the bear market in 2022. Consequently, investors can buy the stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of around 8, well below the peak P/S ratio of 66 three years ago.\n\nUltimately, investors should remember that the growth in the company's customer base and revenue has continued regardless of the stock's performance. That makes it more likely the stock will rise for the rest of the year as its performance more closely matches that of the company.\n\nSaaS is out of fashion, but it might not stay that way\n\nJustin Pope (Monday.com): Monday.com is my pick for the rest of 2024. This software-as-a-service (SaaS) company sells low- and no-code work management software that helps companies collaborate and operate their businesses. Gone are the days of hand-written flow charts, mismatched spreadsheets, and using a different application for every task. Monday.com consolidates all of that into a cloud-based platform that keeps everyone on the same page and is implementing generative AI to take its user experience to the next level.\n\nMonday.com grows using a land-and-expand model. In other words, it starts at one or two seats in a company, then spreads to new teams and departments as it proves useful. That's fueling rapid customer growth in high-budget categories. Monday.com's customers spending at least $50,000 grew 56% in 2023, and those spending over $100,000 grew 58%.\n\nThe business is very profitable, with free cash flow aggressively ramping up as Monday.com's revenue grows faster than its expenses. Analysts believe the company will earn $2 per share this year, and earnings will average 65% annualized growth over the next three to five years, so buckle up. MNDY Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nWall Street has cooled dramatically on software names, and Monday.com is no exception. Shares are down 57% from their former high. Shares trade at a forward P/E of 95 today, but that will get cheaper in a hurry if the company delivers earnings growth up to analysts' expectations. It's a potentially great investment for the rest of 2024 and far beyond that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "The tech market has come a long way since 2022, when macroeconomic headwinds caused a market downturn that saw the Nasdaq-100 Technology index plunge 40%. The same index has since risen 68%, driven by easing inflation and advances in budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a major growth driver in the market's recovery, with its stock up 113% since the start of 2023 after tumbling 50% the year before. The company has rallied investors with an impressive turnaround in its e-commerce business and an expanding position in AI.\n\nThe tech giant is on a promising growth path as the biggest name in online retail and as a leader in cloud computing with its platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon continued to prove this on April 30, beating earnings estimates once again and delivering glowing results for its first quarter of 2024.\n\nShares of Amazon climbed 17% year to date but have shown no signs of slowing. Here are two reasons to buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. A promising start to 2024\n\nAmazon shares began trending up in extended trading on April 30 after the company's successful earnings release. In Q1 2024, its revenue rose 13% year over year to $43 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts by $750 million. Additionally, earnings per share hit $0.98, versus expectations of $0.83.\n\nThe company profited from stellar growth in its retail division. Operating income in its North America segment increased 455% to $5 billion. Meanwhile, international operating income achieved $903 million, a significant improvement from the $1.2 billion in losses it reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDespite Amazon's expansion into other industries, e-commerce sales still account for more than 80% of its revenue. Consequently, recent growth in its retail segment only strengthens the company's outlook.\n\nHowever, the best reasons to invest in Amazon's stock are its AWS platform and advertising services. These digital-based businesses fortify the company's earnings for the long term, making it less vulnerable to macro factors. In Q1 2024, AWS revenue increased by 17% year over year, with advertising sales rising 24%.\n\nAmazon has been a sleeping giant in digital advertising, with companies like Alphabet and Meta Platforms dominating the industry. However, the recent introduction of ads on its streaming platform Prime Video and other expansions in the sector have boosted earnings and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\n2. Amazon expects artificial intelligence to bolster its cloud business over the long term\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the artificial intelligence (AI) market hit a valuation nearing $200 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. This growth trajectory will see the industry achieve close to $2 trillion in spending. As a result, Amazon's hyperfocus on expanding its role in the industry could pay off in a major way in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the start of 2023, Amazon has invested heavily in AI, introducing a range of new AI tools on AWS and announcing a venture into chip development. Demand for AI services has skyrocketed over the last year, with businesses increasingly turning to cloud platforms like AWS to boost efficiency with the generative technology.\n\nMeanwhile, AWS holds a leading 31% market share in cloud computing, with its client list boasting tech giants like Netflix, Meta Platforms, and Sony. Amazon's potent role in cloud computing could give it a leg up in AI, compared to rivals like Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud.\n\nIn Q1 2024, AWS was responsible for 61% of Amazon's operating income, despite earning the smallest portion of revenue between its three segments. The cloud division is easily the most lucrative part of the business.\n\nAWS revenue has slowed over the last year amid rising competition. However, the company expects cost-cutting measures to soon take effect, with AI engagement projected to boost earnings. MSFT PS Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMoreover, Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is the lowest among some of its biggest cloud rivals, suggesting now could be the best time to invest. P/S is a valuation metric that divides a company's market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. Generally, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nIn Amazon's case, its P/S makes it one of the best-valued stocks in the cloud market and, potentially, AI. Alongside booming e-commerce and advertising businesses, Amazon stock is a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

It seems that it might be time to reconsider holding this volatile stock in hopes of a turnaround.\n\niRobot's current financial health\n\niRobot's projected revenue for the first quarter of 2024, ranging from $137 million to $142 million, suggests a continuation of its previous fiscal strategies rather than a dynamic response to its recent challenges. This approach might convey stability, but in the wake of an 80% stock decline, it also raises concerns about the company's ability to innovate and capture new market opportunities. The forecasted gross margin of 23% to 24% further indicates little profitability, underscoring ongoing struggles with cost efficiency and competitive pricing in a fiercely competitive sector.\n\nThe stability in revenue might not signify resilience, but rather a stagnation that could hinder recovery and growth. And the low gross margin suggests that iRobot keeps selling at lower profit margins and possibly facing increased production costs or pricing pressures from competitors, which could erode profitability further.\n\nImpact of the Amazon deal termination\n\nThe fallout from the terminated Amazon deal, initially seen as a growth catalyst, left iRobot to navigate its recovery alone, stripped of the potential benefits of Amazon's resources and technological synergy. This termination, attributed largely to regulatory roadblocks in the E.U., thwarted a significant strategic pivot that might have bolstered iRobot's market standing and innovation trajectory. Many investors may have picked up iRobot shares expecting the deal to be completed.\n\nThe collapse of this acquisition could signal a significant missed opportunity for iRobot to enhance its competitive edge and pricing power. The partnership with Amazon could have provided iRobot with a platform to scale innovations and reduce costs, elements now sorely missed as the company tries to navigate a recovery on its own.\n\nAnalysis of iRobot's financial expectations\n\nThe projected operating income of $7 million to $11 million set against a net loss per share of $2 or more paints a grim picture of iRobot's financial health going forward. These figures reflect both immediate fiscal pressures and the inadequacy of current restructuring efforts to significantly turn around the financial fortunes of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch a negative financial outlook will likely prompt shareholders to question the efficacy of the ongoing cost management strategies, which appear insufficient against the scale of the financial challenges the company is facing. The persistence of net losses, despite operational income, suggests deep-seated issues that might not be quickly resolved, posing significant risk to continued investment.\n\niRobot's restructuring plans and future outlook\n\niRobot's restructuring, aimed at reducing costs and streamlining operations, remains essential but may not be sufficient to overcome the competitive disadvantages made more difficult by rapid technological advancements and aggressive market competitors. The company's future now depends on its ability to innovate within its product lines and find new revenue streams, a challenge made steeper without the support of a tech giant like Amazon.\n\niRobot's stand-alone strategies post-restructuring have the potential to offer a competitive edge, but thus far appear to simply maintain the status quo. The need for breakthrough product innovations or market expansion strategies appears more acute than ever given the current competitive landscape.\n\nShould investors continue holding out for a turnaround?\n\nGiven the substantial risks and the grim financial projections, divesting from iRobot could be a wise decision at this time. The company's ongoing struggles and the uncertainty surrounding its ability to navigate a successful turnaround suggest that the potential loss from maintaining an investment in iRobot could outweigh the benefits. A strategic exit might not only prevent further losses, but also free up capital for more promising investment opportunities.\n\nCareful consideration of iRobot's current position and market prospects suggests that selling shares could be a prudent strategy. With uncertain recovery prospects and more stable opportunities available elsewhere, reallocating resources might better serve investment interests, enhancing portfolio stability and growth potential in a turbulent market. Only those with an exceptional risk tolerance may wish to stick it out, maintaining hope that changes underway help the company restore the confidence it garnered when shares traded at 10 times their current prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iRobot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iRobot, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iRobot wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Ready to Invest in Artificial Intelligence in 2024? 2 Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades (Hint: They're Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is probably the most talked-about investment area right now -- and for good reason. The AI market is expected to expand at a double-digit compound annual growth rate over the next few years to reach more than $1 trillion by 2030. That means many companies -- and those who invest in them -- may benefit.\n\nOn top of this, AI is generating excitement because it offers concrete examples of how it could save companies time and money. For example, it can streamline processes or help a pharmaceutical company develop drugs more quickly. So, it's easy to understand the importance of this technology. And that means you may want to start investing in AI players in 2024, in the early days of this high-growth story.\n\nNvidia, the world's leading AI chipmaker, might seem like the obvious choice -- but this high-flying stock isn't the only game in town. In fact, two other AI players make fantastic stocks to buy and hold for decades thanks to their investments in AI -- and the potential for this technology to boost their earnings over time. Let's check them out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), as the parent of Google, already is the global Internet search leader, holding more than 85% share. And the company's investment in AI is likely to keep this going. Alphabet is applying AI to search to broaden its capabilities and improve search in general.\n\nThe company has been testing AI throughout search, serving billions of queries so far. The tests have shown increased search usage among people using the AI features and higher user satisfaction regarding search results. Here's why this is so important: Alphabet generates most of its revenue from advertisements on Google Search pages, and the more people use search, the more advertisers will keep coming back.\n\nIt's also important to remember that Alphabet offers six products that boast more than 2 billion monthly users, and these represent opportunities to integrate AI and grow revenue. Finally, Alphabet's Google Cloud business continues to increase revenue in the double-digits, and this could continue thanks to its selection of AI products and services. More than 60% of funded generative AI start-ups are already customers of Google Cloud, Alphabet said in its recent earnings call.\n\nAnd Alphabet also emphasized that it has \"clear paths\" to monetizing its investment in AI through ads, cloud, and subscriptions. All of this means AI could have a significant positive impact on Alphabet's business over time, making now a great moment to get in on this top tech stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) benefits from AI in two ways. First, its investments in the technology are helping it cut costs and please partners in its e-commerce business. And second, AI is boosting Amazon Web Services' (AWS) revenue as the business sells AI products and services.\n\nAs a global leader in e-commerce, Amazon strives to increase efficiency, and AI supports that by helping determine the fastest package delivery routes, for example. And a newly released tool allows Amazon to create a detailed product page for an item with just a link to the seller's website. Amazon says more than 100,000 sellers have used at least one of its generative AI tools.\n\nBut the biggest impact of all may be in the earnings potential of AWS, which is already the company's main profit driver. AWS, the world's leading cloud provider, sells a wide variety of AI products and services -- from top-performing Nvidia chips and platforms to AWS' own chips for the cost-conscious customer.\n\nAll this has helped AWS already generate a multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate. And it's important to remember we're still in the early days of AI adoption, so AWS' AI long-term growth prospects look particularly bright. The opportunity ahead is \"very large,\" CEO Andy Jassy said during the company's earnings call this week.\n\nSo, Amazon's already seeing significant revenue gains thanks to its AI investment, and this momentum may just be getting started -- and that makes it a top AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 25 richest billionaires in technology industry. To skip our detailed analysis of the technology industry, go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires in Technology Industry.\n\nTechnology Market Outlook\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, 2023 experienced a technological comeback and generative AI was one of the major drivers of the tech industry. Generative AI is the technology that powers large language models such as ChatGPT and Adobe Photoshop's new AI image filler, Generative Fill. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the AI market was valued at $40 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 42%. The increasing demand for generative AI products will add nearly about $280 billion of new software revenue. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are four of the biggest tech companies investing heavily in generative AI and are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of AI, as per  Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIn a report, Deloitte highlighted that global IT investments are projected to experience a double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services in 2024. AI-related investments are expected to reach $200 billion globally by 2025, primarily led by the US. Almost all enterprise software firms will embed generative AI into at least some of their products in 2024, as per Deloitte. The shift towards generative AI will likely help software companies reach an average revenue of $10 billion by the end of 2024. For the firms working on the hardware front, Deloitte estimates their revenue to surpass $50 billion in 2024, driven by the chips and servers market.\n\nOn April 28, Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk, on X posted that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will spend around $10 billion in combined training and inference AI during 2024. Musk further said, “Any company not spending at this level, and doing so efficiently, cannot compete.”\n\nThe technology industry is diverse and has vast market segments. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global IT market was valued at $8.50 trillion in 2023 and is expected to reach $9.03 trillion in 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. By 2028, the IT market is anticipated to reach $12.41 trillion, growing at a compound growth rate of 8.3% from 2024 to 2028.\n\nMajor Players in The Technology Industry\n\nSome of the major players in the tech space include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let's discuss some recent updates by these companies. These companies are also some of the most popular technology stocks among billionaires.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has become one of those few companies achieving the $2 trillion market capitalization mark. The company reached the $2 trillion market capitalization following its first quarter earnings beat. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the earnings for the first quarter of 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $1.89, beating consensus by $0.39. The revenue was reported at around $80.54 billion and surpassed estimates by $1.84 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is planning for the next wave of AI investment. Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“It was a great quarter led by a strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we've gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue.\n\nNow, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation and search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths.”\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech giant that is massively expanding in AI services. On April 29, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that it is collaborating with German mass media firm, Axel Springer SE. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Axel Springer SE have expanded their partnership across advertising, AI, content, and cloud computing. The collaboration between the two firms aims to leverage cutting-edge innovation to evolve independent journalism worldwide. Here is what Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO, Satya Nadella, said regarding the partnership extension:\n\n“This new generation of AI is transforming nearly every aspect of work and life, including how people search for and consume content online. Our expanded partnership with Axel Springer brings together their leadership in digital publishing with the full power of the Microsoft Cloud — including our ad solutions — to build innovative AI-driven experiences and create new opportunity for advertisers and users.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world. The company is mainly focused on AI-driven technology across its segments. On April 19, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported that two of its latest chips, NVIDIA RTX A400 and A1000, will enhance AI-powered design and productivity workflows. In addition, the AI-powered chips will have the ability to help professionals and creatives with better computing power, regardless of the scale and complexity of their projects.\n\nThe technology industry is expected to experience strong growth in 2024 and beyond.

        "title": "Is Apple Missing Out on the AI Hype?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence buzz across the tech world has increased over the past year. All the big players are competing with each other to grab a piece of this booming market. Nevertheless, one tech giant is seemingly on the limp in this race for dominance, or at least that's the image it wants to portray. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always stepped up the game by boosting innovation and enhancing the user experience. But with AI, the tech giant has been maintaining a discrete profile for a long time.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BTI.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that AI is here to revolutionize the tech landscape, a sort of renaissance if one thinks of it. PwC estimates AI will contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Given these rosy projections, Apple's toned-down approach toward the technology has raised speculations about whether it is missing out on the AI hype or playing its cards in silence to take the market by surprise.\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nDespite recent financial struggles, including a major revenue slump since the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Apple saw a nearly 50% spike last year, though it lagged other tech giants such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company had a challenging start to 2024 with shares tumbling amid a series of analyst downgrades and was dethroned by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world. Some critics have blamed Apple for not having a clear AI strategy unlike its competitors, such as Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which are aggressively investing in the technology.\n\nWhen it comes to AI (or machine learning, as Apple prefers to say), the company is not new to integrating such features into its devices. It has revolutionized many features using machine learning, including Siri, facial recognition and personalized recommendations. However, in the current landscape, compared to other tech giants, Apple has taken a more cautious approach to introducing and announcing AI features and investments. Apple is making calculated moves in the AI space behind the scenes. The company has acquired several AI start-ups in the past decade and is partnering with universities and research institutions to collaborate on projects.\n\nResearch and development spending is one of the key indicators to measure a company's commitment to introducing new features and advancements into its business strategy, especially for tech companies. Apple's R&D spending was roughly 7% of its revenue for 2022. In comparison, in the same year, Google and Microsoft allocated nearly double for R&D and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) spending was more than four times Apple's. According to the 2023 Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard by the European Commission, Apple ranks in fourth place, above Asian rivals Huawei (fifth) and Samsung (XKRX:005930) (seventh). However, the company ranks below Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft (first three places). While this spending disparity could be highlighting a difference in priorities, it is easy to overlook Apple's strategy of acquiring resources in other areas to step up innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle-Apple alliance: A double-edged sword\n\nRecent reports suggest Apple could enter an AI partnership with Alphabet's Google. As per Bloomberg, Apple is negotiating with the Google parent company to license its state-of-the-art AI model, Gemini. If the deal goes through, Apple might integrate Gemini's AI features into its upcoming operating systems for devices. The possibility of this partnership raises many questions about the company's long-standing tradition of prioritizing in-house development and tight control over its technology.\n\nGoogle and Apple have been in a strategic partnership for a long while and it has proven to be a profitable one. Currently, Google is the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser, and to secure this position Google is reportedly paying around $18 billion annually to Apple. Therefore, Google's AI model Gemini seems like a natural choice for Apple. However, other than the obvious contradiction of the iPhone maker's privacy-first policy, this deal might raise many other concerns, including legal challenges and reduced quality in the user experience.\n\nCurrently, tech giants are facing scrutiny around the world, especially from the U.S. government and European Union. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for its alleged monopoly on the smartphone market and unfair treatment of developers through its App Store system. Partnering with another major tech firm and a rival might fuel the current controversy and could attract more legal scrutiny. Moreover, if Apple begins to rely on Google for AI tools, it could stifle competition and reduce consumer choices in the future for potential AI feature upgrades. Google's AI is a cloud-based system that allows developers to use consumer data to strengthen the LLM to become more efficient, which means the privacy of the user data will not be assured. This means more red flags for Apple.\n\nThe current regulatory scrutiny is already hampering Apple's operations. The potential delay in winning the lawsuit and the restrictions that may be imposed by the government could hinder the company's efforts in the AI field. Additionally, the financial burden of a lawsuit could put a halt on the company's ability to find an internal AI solution. Moreover, a well-defined and transparent data protection framework should be put into practice before entering into a partnership with Google, if at all.\n\nApple's AI master plan\n\nEven though Apple is not vocal about its advancements with AI efforts, several ongoing projects are making progress. News surrounding the company's own AI model has garnered substantial traction. According to sources, Apple has reportedly developed a large language model called Ajax GPT, with a performing capacity exceeding GPT 3.5. Also, it may be working on an AI-powered chatbot dubbed Apple GPT.\n\nApple might have been suspiciously quiet about AI in product launches. However, it has acquired the greatest number of startups among all tech giants since 2017. The company is likely to have spent around $1 billion in acquiring various AI ventures. In 2023 alone, Apple reportedly bought more than 30 AI ventures. These acquisitions take place mostly to cover various specialties such as self-driving technology, voice design, music generation and image recognition, but sometimes to even acquire the talented individuals behind these startups.\n\nThe latest and most important addition to Apple's AI arsenal is DarwinAI. Acquiring DarwinAI can be seen as an investment in technology as well as personnel, particularly specialists in machine learning and AI from the University of Waterloo. A prominent figure in the AI community and former director at the University of Waterloo, Alexander Wang, is currently appointed as a director at Apple, leading the company's AI efforts in Canada. Also, DarwinAI's synthesis model is expected to help Apple's most ambitious AI capability; on-device AI (also referred to as Edge AI) with plans to move forward with generative AI programs in the future.\n\nTwo recent theses published by Apple have shown the company's effectiveness in incorporating advanced levels of AI within the pre-existing ecosystem. One research paper in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne delves into the development of the MM1 generative AI model. The results of the thesis demonstrate Apple's capabilities in developing cutting-edge AI architectures, particularly multimodal learning, which combines images with text data.\n\nAnother paper published showcases the successful execution of large language models in natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks with limited memory. The methods used in the thesis collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a four to 25 times increase in inference speed compared to other approaches in CPU and GPU. Ultimately, this research paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory to deliver exceptionally faster performance.\n\nBoth these research papers and recent acquisitions indicate Apple is on the right track to offering on-device AI capabilities that will far exceed what is currently available in the market.\n\nUsability focus is Apple's product strategy\n\nVoice Assistant, Facial Recognition, Photo optimization, Personalized recommendations, Animoji and Fitness tracking may look like functions that have nothing to do with AI, but all these features are fundamentally built upon various machine learning technologies. Apple was the pioneering tech brand that managed to integrate these features seamlessly into mobile devices successfully. Today, it is working behind the scenes to improve these features by integrating AI.\n\nWhen Siri, the voice assistant, was released, it was received remarkably well across the globe. But soon after the initial product launch, because of Siri's inability to complete slightly advanced tasks, its credibility declined. Following many internal conflicts faced by Apple's Siri team with engineers frustrated by a lack of tools and data to improve it, the chat bot has started lagging behind its competitors. Meanwhile, Google Assistant, with its superior natural language processing and ability to handle complex queries, and Amazon Alexa, with its vast compatible ecosystem, are gaining momentum.\n\nWith the new on-device AI integration, Apple may have reversed the future of Siri and also could enhance the performance of Apple fitness trackers. The Apple Watch already integrates AI features to enhance fitness tracking. For example, the watch uses machine learning to identify workout types and analyze heart rate data, helping to offer more personalized coaching assistance. However, some competitors offer more advanced AI-powered health monitoring features, including blood pressure monitoring.\n\nKeeping up with its brand of prioritizing the user experience more than anything else, Apple has made its first direct AI-related product with the new MacBook Air with an M3 chip highlighting its capabilities for AI tasks. This can be seen as a major breakthrough in Apple's AI strategy, promising its customers not a cloud-based AI service, but an on-device AI experience that upholds user privacy.\n\nApple follows a pattern of announcing new features as they are coming to the market. Therefore, the upcoming Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June may bring potential AI-related announcements. Speculations suggest AI features will be integrated into the new Mac OS as well as iOS 18. The speculations are further strengthened with Apple acknowledging the term AI in its latest quarterly earnings transcript, deviating from its usual terminology. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the introduction of generative AI software in Apple products later in the year.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of AI-integrated hardware such as Edge AI is expected to have a positive impact on the iPhone upgrade cycle. With the current upcycle period standing at a record high of 4.5 years, users upgrading their mobiles for a better AI-powered user experience will boost new hardware sales. This is crucial for Apple amid four straight quarters of sales declines and the dampening sales numbers in China. Analysts such as Dan Ives and Ben Reitzes believe that with AI integration, Apple will experience another supercycle in smartphone upgrades.\n\nApple's AI gamble - Missing out or playing the long game?\n\nApple may not be as aggressively discussing its AI plans compared to other tech giants, but the company is making steady progress behind the scenes. The company's on-device AI integration strategy may prove to be the differentiator in the future. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26, the stock is valued at a premium to the five-year average of 24. This premium may seem unjustifiable at first, but if the company's on-device AI strategy succeeds, a potential iPhone upgrade supercycle will help it book stellar revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Apple is certainly not missing out on AI despite not joining the hype publicly, yet. Contrarian investors may want to build a position in Apple to potentially benefit from a surprise AI announcement in the coming months.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Invest in Amazon (AMZN) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.5% and 6.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AMZN\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in AMZN?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 11.5% over the past month to $4.43.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Results: Amazon.com, Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates",
        "content": "Investors in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.4% to close at US$185 following the release of its first-quarter results. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$143b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Amazon.com surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$0.98 per share, a notable 18% above expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Amazon.com after the latest results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Amazon.com's 56 analysts is for revenues of US$638.8b in 2024. This reflects a solid 8.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to surge 23% to US$4.44. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$641.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.15 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.\n\nThere's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$216, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Amazon.com, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$245 and the most bearish at US$180 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Amazon.com's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Amazon.com's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 11% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 17% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 10% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Amazon.com is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Amazon.com's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$216, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Amazon.com analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nYou can also see our  analysis of Amazon.com's Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Growth stocks epitomize the attraction of equity investing due to their strong potential and ability to generate substantial returns. When referring to these stocks, those companies with leadership and business models are poised to capture significant market share within industries and are expected to expand rapidly. During their early high-growth phases, figures like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates accrued much of their wealth from ownership in iconic growth stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\r\n\r\nGiven the myriad available options, identifying specific growth stocks to buy with the potential to appreciate exponentially can be quite challenging. While the upside can be huge, significant downside risks also exist. Therefore, traders must exercise diligence to separate opportunities from potential losses.\n\nTraits like large and growing target markets, dominant market share, and capable leadership in can help uncover growth stocks you’ll kick yourself for not buying today.

The streaming giant recently reported subscriber numbers that significantly surpassed estimates, with earnings blowing past forecasts. While the stock price dipped slightly after the company announced plans to stop reporting subscriber counts as it focuses on profitability, this could present a valuable “buy the dip” opportunity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNetflix shares are up 27% already this year despite the recent pullback. Even without explicit subscriber reporting, investors can still gauge growth through metrics like Netflix’s steadily increasing share of TV viewing. It recently topped 8.1%, indicating the vast market potential ahead as Netflix works toward surpassing cable.\n\nCurrently, down over 20% from recent highs, NFLX has technically entered a correction phase, and its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio came down to 38x forward earnings estimates. Solid leadership positioned to maximize opportunities and continued strong growth makes Netflix stand out as a top growth stock to avoid disappointment.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.\n\nSource: Julio Ricco / Shutterstock\n\nWhile an accounting company may not initially seem like one of the top growth stocks to buy, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) could change that. The company owns TurboTax, a brand that has been front of mind for many Americans focused on taxes recently. Despite operating in the seemingly stable tax preparation industry, Intuit has consistently delivered double-digit revenue growth. As taxes remain inevitable, demand for TurboTax and Intuit’s other products and services stays strong.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter Intuit reported a 20% jump in earnings last quarter, management anticipates continued top and bottom line growth in the low double digits – in line with its proven track record of steady expansion and shareholder returns. Over the past five years, Intuit has achieved an average earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 13%.\n\nAnalyst consensus also points to further upside, with a price target 10% above current levels. Based on the company’s history of exceeding estimates, Intuit’s consistent growth makes it one of the top growth stocks to buy for investors seeking high-quality, growth-oriented opportunities.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) A syringe with a safety cap and a surgical mask laid out on a blank background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michele Ursi\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is the third of growth stocks to buy worthy of consideration. The company has already grown substantially from the success of its cystic fibrosis drug Trikafta, which now captures nearly 90% of the U.S. market. However, the company is not resting on its accomplishments and is reinvesting its consistent profits into expansion opportunities that can further growth potential.\n\nVertex is currently pursuing partnerships with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP), as well as the acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences (NASDAQ:ALPN) to diversify its pipeline in kidney disease treatments. Additionally, the FDA recently approved Vertex’s new drug application for Suzetrigine, a non-opioid treatment for acute pain. With a diversifying pipeline and reinvestment of revenues, Vertex displays qualities, making it one of the growth stocks to buy before tomorrow becomes too late.\n\nAfter beating EPS estimates for 25 consecutive quarters and improving shareholder equity year in and year out while reducing debt, its earnings report on May 6 could be the catalyst for further growth.​\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "What's in the clouds for Amazon's (AMZN) lucrative AWS business: $100 billion in 2024 sales.\n\n\"This quarter, we just announced a few days ago that AWS did hit the $100 billion annualized revenue run rate milestone — not many tech companies have done that,\" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said on the Opening Bid podcast (video above).\n\nAdded Selipsky, \"I think it's a notable milestone.\"\n\nPowered by voracious demand for generative AI services and the ongoing push to move workloads to the cloud, Amazon's enterprise cloud operation is fresh off a bang-up first quarter.\n\nAWS sales accelerated for the second straight quarter, rising 17% year over year to $25 billion. The business — which Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hired Selipsky to run in 2021 — saw operating profits nearly double to $9.4 billion.\n\nThe division represented about 62% of Amazon's Q1 operating profits. AWS CEO Adam Selipsky delivers a keynote address during AWS re:Invent 2023. (Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) (Noah Berger via Getty Images)\n\nSelipsky contends that with 85% of companies still storing their data on-premise, the tailwinds for AWS are just beginning to gust.\n\n\"We're optimistic about the business outlook for AWS and I think it can continue to grow really rapidly. I don't really see an upper limit on it,\" Selipsky says. \"Of course it's not our birthright, it's not guaranteed. We'll only be as successful as what we do tomorrow for customers.\"\n\nThe avid water skier and wine aficionado says he doesn't wake up each day thinking about crushing rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Rather, he spends his time plotting out how to keep customers happy — part of the \"Day One\" culture etched into the company by founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nWall Street believes Selipsky and his AWS team will continue to be the main drivers of Amazon's profits — and stock price.\n\n\"Drivers [of AWS] are strong and sustainable — the ending of cost optimization cycles, core cloud demand, and Gen AI workloads that are amounting to a multi-billion revenue run rate,\" Evercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney said in a client note following Amazon's earnings.\n\nMahaney continued, \"Key is that this marked the first quarter since the third quarter of 2022 that AWS dollar revenue growth surpassed that of [Microsoft] Azure, which changes the cloud industry leadership narrative.\"\n\nSomething else to watch: The tech trade\n\nThe Magnificent Seven trade — Microsoft, Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — has swung back to life amid strong earnings from the aforementioned Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks That Could Make You a Fortune (if You Dare)",
        "content": "I believe that there are many worthwhile EV stocks to buy currently available. That’s because, in my view, by 2030 electric vehicles will likely account for close to a majority of all the vehicles sold in the U.S. The main reason for this is that electricity will always be cheaper on average, than gasoline. After all, oil is in general much more expensive to produce than electricity since companies have to conduct exploration operations in order to find oil, and drilling for oil is rather costly. Additionally, speculators frequently bid up the price of oil in America, while electricity prices are generally tightly regulated.\n\nLet’s not forget that the amount of time needed to charge EV batteries is constantly dropping, while the number of public EV chargers is rapidly increasing and batteries are consistently getting cheaper to produce. So total cost of ownership for EVs will eventually be much lower than gasoline-powered vehicles, and EVs are going to become much more convenient to use than they are now. For long-term investors who are brave enough to defy the current, anti-EV hype, here are three top EV stocks to buy.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) has become a rather popular brand among both consumers and businesses. As evidence of the latter assertion, consider that the EV startup delivered nearly 50,000 EVs last year. Meanwhile, the firm received over 68,000 orders for its upcoming midsize electric SUV in less than 24 hours.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, the automaker recently initiated a rebate of up to $5,000 for some consumers who trade in certain types of trucks to buy one of Rivian’s EVs. I believe that this rebate will significantly increase the automaker’s deliveries this year while enticing thousands of consumers to buy or lease a Rivian EV for the first time.\n\nOn the commercial side, Rivian is slated to deliver about 86,500 more vans to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over the long term, while AT&T (NYSE:T) is currently testing Rivian’s EVS. Additionally, JB Poindexter & Co, whose customers include Fedex (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS), is selling a new delivery van that utilizes RIVN’s chassis.\n\nThe company’s positive catalysts on both the consumer and commercial sides make it one of the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nXpeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nXpeng’s (NASDAQ:XPEV) deliveries surged 33% in April versus the same period a year earlier. The company’s huge, seven seat, multi-purpose EV (MPV), the X9, continues to be very popular. The firm provided its customers with 1,959 of them last month. According to Xpeng, the X9 is the top selling electric MPV in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe automaker noted that its driver-assistance system, the XNGP, is being used by 82% of its customers in urban venues. This suggests that Xpeng’s customers are finding the system useful. Widely viewed as similar to Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) full-self driving system, the XNGP was called fairly impressive by a Chinese YouTube broadcaster. Meanwhile, the website Elektreksimilarly labeled videos of it in action as impressive.\n\nXNGP is now available on every road in China. And, the firm is working on getting it ready to be rolled out in Europe. Also importantly, Xpeng is preparing to launch what it calls the industry’s first mass-produced visual neural network large model in vehicles. The system will reportedly enable its EVs to see roads and learn about driving similar to a human.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) An EVgo charging station at the Victor Valley Mall in the City of Victorville.\n\nSource: Felipe Sanchez / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn March, Canadian bank RBC Capital echoed my longtime bullish feelings on EV charging company EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO). Specifically, the bank upgraded the shares to “outperform” from “sector perform.” RBC says the company will benefit from the increased prevalence of EVs going forward.\n\nThe bank also expects EVgo to actually be helped by elevated interest rates and the slowdown of EV growth. That’s because those factors are preventing small companies from entering the EV charging sector and competing with EVgo.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the company’s revenue surged 84% versus the same period a year earlier to $50 million. Meanwhile, its gross profit came in at $3.5 million. That is much better than the gross loss of $1.1 million it experienced during the same period in 2022. Also importantly, the firm recruited over 110,000 new customers in Q4.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in RIVN, XPEV and EVGO.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For many investors, Nvidia is the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock. Its graphics processing units power many of the most advanced AI systems, and the company holds over 80% market share in AI processors. In short, from a semiconductor perspective, Nvidia is almost single-handedly enabling the AI boom. That drove shares 239% higher in 2023.\n\nEven so, the hedge fund billionaires listed below sold down their positions in Nvidia during the fourth quarter, while simultaneously redeploying capital across Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), two red-hot AI stocks up 191% and 77%, respectively, in the past year.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, reducing his stake by 45%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in Palantir by 1,100%, and increased his stake in Amazon by 1%.\n\nJoel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset Management sold 13,480 shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, reducing his stake by 16%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in Palantir by 1,800% and increased his stake in Amazon by 3%.\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, reducing his stake by 66%. Meanwhile, he started a small position in Palantir and increased his stake in Amazon by 11%.\n\nThe three fund managers discussed above outperformed the S&P 500 during the three-year period that ended in December 2023. That provides investors with additional incentive to consider their recent purchases. Are Palantir and Amazon still worth buying?\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir specializes in data analytics. Its software lets businesses capture and integrate data, develop and manage artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) models, and build applications that incorporate those data sets and models. Those applications help workers make better decisions, which theoretically leads to better business outcomes. The company recently debuted a new product called AIP, or Artificial Intelligence Platform, which brings support for large language models and generative AI to its existing software.\n\nIndustry analysts have praised Palantir for its technological prowess. For instance, Forrester Research ranked its Foundry software as the best AI/ML platform on the market in a report published in July 2022. Likewise, Dresner Advisory Services ranked Palantir as a leader in the AI/ML and data science market in a report published in August 2023. Around the same time, Dresner also recognized the company as a leader in ModelOps (model operations), a discipline focused on model lifecycle management.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir reported encouraging financial results in the fourth quarter. Its customer count climbed 35% and the average existing customer spent 8% more. In turn, revenue increased 20% to $608 million and non-GAAP (adjusted) net income doubled to reach $0.08 per diluted share. CEO Alex Karp said demand for AIP was a key growth driver. \"Momentum with AIP is now significantly contributing to new revenue and new customers,\" he wrote in his shareholder letter. \"The organic and unconstrained demand for its capabilities is unlike anything we have seen in two decades.\"\n\nGoing forward, Straits Research forecasts that big data analytics spending will increase at 14% annually through 2031. However, Wall Street analysts expect Palantir to grow sales at 21% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 22.8 times sales look relatively expensive. Personally, I would not buy this stock until that multiple comes down. It's also worth mentioning that Palantir traded at an average of 18.6 times sales during the fourth quarter, when Englander, Greenblatt, and Cohen were buying shares. I would be more comfortable with that valuation.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three markets. In e-commerce, it operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales. In digital advertising, it is the largest retail media company in the U.S. and the third-largest adtech company in the world. Amazon has steadily gained share in both markets in recent years, and the shares gains are projected to continue in the future.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for 31% of cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS) spending in the first quarter, 6 percentage points more than second-place Microsoft Azure. AWS actually lost 1 percentage point of market share over the past year. However, the company remains uniquely positioned to monetize AI given its leadership in the CIPS market.\n\nAdditionally, AWS could reclaim lost market share with help from AI products Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q. Bedrock is a cloud service that lets businesses customize large language models and build bespoke generative AI applications. Amazon Q is a conversational assistant that leans on generative AI to answer questions and automate coding projects. On the first-quarter earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy shared this information: \"Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data, but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors at catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions.\"\n\nAmazon topped Wall Street's expectations with its first-quarter financial report. Revenue rose 13% to $143 billion as growth accelerated across advertising services, cloud services, and online stores. Meanwhile, GAAP net income more than tripled to reach $0.98 per diluted share as the company continued to make progress on cost control.\n\nRetail e-commerce sales are forecast to grow at 8% annually through 2030, and the digital advertising and cloud computing markets are forecast to expand at annual rates of 15% and 14%, respectively. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five years.\n\nThe stock currently trades at 3.2 times sales, a reasonable valuation compared to the consensus sales growth forecast by analysts. Personally, I would feel comfortable buying shares at that valuation. But investors should know that Amazon traded at an average of 2.6 times sales during the fourth quarter, when the billionaire fund managers discussed earlier were buying the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Brazil Succumbs to the Retail Apocalypse It Staved Off for Years",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The retail shakeout has reached Brazil, where local players are starting to restructure and consolidate amid stiff competition from foreign giants like Amazon.com Inc., MercadoLibre Inc. and Shein Group Ltd.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel Online Turkey Confirms All Trade Halt With Israel Over War in Gaza Huawei Secretly Backs US Research, Awarding Millions in Prizes Biden Calls Ally Japan ‘Xenophobic’ Along With China, Russia In Jamie Dimon's America, the Stock Market Has Already Voted\n\nThough e-commerce reshaped retailing in the US and Europe even before the pandemic, a confluence of economic, financial and logistical circumstance kept the South American nation insulated from the trend until later. That means the bankruptcies, mergers and strategic shifts that have rippled through the sector elsewhere are now coming for some of the biggest Brazilian chains.\n\nMarcelo Noronha, the top executive at Banco Bradesco SA, flagged retail as one of the weakest segments of the Brazilian economy right now. “When compared with other sectors, there are more challenges for retailers,” he told reporters Thursday.\n\nLast weekend, Grupo Casas Bahia SA — one of country’s most popular chains — filed an out-of-court recovery plan to reschedule around 4.1 billion reais ($802 million) in debt payments. And credit has been tight ever since the downfall of Americanas SA in an accounting scandal last year, which put the entire sector under the microscope.\n\nThere’s also a growing wave of tie-ups. Pet Center Comercio e Participacoes SA, known as Petz, agreed to be bought by its rival Cobasi last month. And in February, Arezzo Industria e Comercio SA purchased Grupo de Moda Soma SA in a bid to create a retail giant.\n\nFor their part, local executives say they are managing the fallout. “There are no plans to close more stores. We have closed several deficient ones and we are now following some that are in ‘intensive care,’” Elcio Ito, chief financial officer at Casas Bahia, said in an interview Monday. “The bulk of that work was done last year.”\n\nArezzo’s deal for Soma is being finalized with a 20% discount since its announcement earlier this year. But the companies, which both turned a profit in 2023, “are confident in the growth of the retail sector for this year,” they said in a written statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nOnce dominated by billionaire-backed blue chips, Brazil’s retail sector is teetering under piles of debt. Many local operators who spent big on digital platforms to compete with global e-commerce behemoths are now also fending off Asian fast-fashion firms Shein and Sea Ltd.’s Shopee.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Foreign companies like Amazon and Shopee have funding and local companies don’t,” João Pedro Soares, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an interview. “You had a first moment of low interest rates, and local companies spent a lot of money to grow. When interest rates went up, they were caught off guard.”\n\nAmericanas, a nearly century old firm backed by Jorge Paulo Lemann and two other billionaires, filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2023. “Amazon and MELI greatly benefitted from the exit of a player like Americanas,” said Renato Donatti, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, referring to MercadoLibre’s stock symbol. “Balance sheets were bruised and companies are having to implement changes that will lead to a slow recovery.”\n\nNames like Magazine Luiza SA, owned by the billionaire Trajano family, and Casas Bahia, which ping-ponged between the late Abilio Diniz and the Klein family, have seen their market value collapse from pandemic highs. Cia Brasileira de Distribuicao SA — known as GPA and founded by Diniz before he lost control to a French rival — has sold assets including its Sao Paulo headquarters and raised capital to slash its debt load.\n\nAt its peak in 2020, Magazine Luiza had a market capitalization of 164 billion reais. After borrowing costs started to rise the following year, the retailer saw 90% of its value evaporate and is now worth 10.9 billion reais. The market value of Americanas, meanwhile, dropped from as much as 63.8 billion reais to just 505 million reais.\n\nThe shakeout isn’t limited to Brazil. Falabella SA — Chile’s second-largest retail group by sales — is considering several “major” asset sales this year after divesting its stake in a mall owner.\n\nIt all mirrors what happened in the US, where the rise of Amazon spelled the end of once-revered brands like Sears and JCPenney, whose former stores became warehouse space for e-commerce competitors. In Brazil, the carnage only began in the past few years as local companies took advantage of historically low rates to pile on debt, build out digital and offer more credit to their customers. Delivery logistics also proved a bigger challenge to overcome than elsewhere, delaying the e-commerce onslaught.\n\n“Retail has been through a roller coaster ride in the last four or five years,” said Luiz Felipe Guanais, an equity research associate at BTG Pactual. The inflation surge followed by high interest rates crimped consumption and boosted debt levels, “shrinking” an industry that traditionally has lower margins, he added.\n\nForeign players have muscled in to fill the void, helped in part by lower barriers to entry. One government program, for example, lifts import taxes on purchases up to $50 for participating companies including Shein and Shopee.\n\nTo gain traction in Brazil, the Asian retailers have adopted a more “local flavor,” testing pop-up stores and attracting local sellers, Guanais said. Last year, Shein announced it would invest $148 million in a partnership with 2,000 textile factories across Brazil — a way to build its presence in the region.\n\nMercadoLibre, meanwhile, has established itself as Brazil’s largest e-commerce platform and shows no signs of slowing down. Unlike Amazon, Shein and Shoppee, it’s focused solely on Latin America. Its profits surged in the first quarter, driven in part by strong growth in the Brazilian market.\n\nThe Uruguay-headquartered firm plans to invest nearly 23 billion reais in Brazil to open distribution centers across three states, to elevate its infrastructure and logistics in the country, where it already has the advantage of being able to deliver within 48 hours. “MercadoLibre is a consolidator,” said Soares, the Citi analyst. “It has gained market share and learned how to navigate the Latin American market.”\n\nMore consolidation may yet be in store as competition intensifies — even if pressure on local retailers dissipates with looser monetary policy, lower household debt and a rebound in consumer spending.\n\nThe scene could get also get even more crowded soon, with Chinese e-commerce app Temu weighing plans to land in Brazil in the first half of the year. “If confirmed, the launch of Temu could further intensify competitive risks to local retailers,” UBS analyst Vinicius Strano said.\n\n--With assistance from Daniel Cancel.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "3 Dow Stocks That Are No-Brainer Buys in May",
        "content": "For nearly 128 years, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) has served as one of the premier barometers of Wall Street's health. Since its official debut on May 26, 1896, it's evolved from a 12-component index that catered heavily to industrial stocks into a 30-stock index packed with diverse, time-tested, multinational businesses.\n\nAlthough the Dow Jones is very much in a new bull market -- the index closed less than 200 points shy of 40,000 on March 28 -- it's retraced by almost 5% over the last five weeks. For opportunistic long-term investors, it means bargains abound.\n\nAs we leap into May, three Dow stocks stand out as no-brainer buys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChevron\n\nThe first seemingly surefire buy in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in May is none other than energy titan Chevron(NYSE: CVX). Although shares of Chevron are down 5% over the trailing-12-months, the company is better-positioned to grow over the long run than it was a year ago.\n\nMacro factors are undeniably working in Chevron's favor. During the COVID-19 pandemic, global energy majors (including Chevron) were forced to significantly pare back their spending due to historic demand uncertainty. Even with capital expenditures now ramping up, the worldwide supply of crude oil remains constrained. The law of supply and demand notes that if demand for a good or service outweighs its supply, the price of that good or service is going to climb.\n\nThough Chevron's drilling operations will benefit immensely from a sustained higher spot price for crude oil, don't overlook that it's an integrated energy company. Chevron generates more of its revenue, collectively, from its midstream (transmission pipelines) and downstream operations (chemical plants and refineries) than it does from drilling. These other segments provide an ideal hedge for Chevron in the event that the spot price of crude declines.\n\nChevron's pending acquisition of Hess is another growth catalyst that would be a mistake to ignore. Assuming the all-share $53 billion deal closes as planned, Chevron will get its proverbial hands on 465,000 acres in the oil-rich Bakken Shale, and will be adding substantial oil-equivalent production in Guyana to its already vast portfolio.\n\nThe company's balance sheet can put skeptics at ease, as well. Chevron closed out March with a net-debt ratio of just 8.8%, which affords it exceptional financial flexibility. Having a top-notch balance sheet has given Chevron's board the confidence to raise its dividend for 37 consecutive years, as well as approve a $75 billion share buyback program.\n\nStory continues\n\nValued at 11 times forecast earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, Chevron stock is currently trading at a 23% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.\n\nAmazon\n\nA second Dow Jones stock that's a no-brainer buy for opportunistic investors in May is e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Amazon was added to the Dow a little over two months ago.\n\nWhen most people think about Amazon, the company's globally dominant online marketplace comes to mind. Last year, Amazon was estimated to have brought in almost 38% of online retail sales in the United States. But while this segment generates a lot of revenue for Amazon, e-commerce plays a minimal role in its cash flow generation and profitability.\n\nThe three segments that make Amazon magnificent from an operating and investment standpoint are Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription services, and advertising services.\n\nAWS is the top cloud infrastructure service platform in the world, with an estimated 31% share of global spend in the September-ended quarter, according to tech-analysis firm Canalys. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, which means the more than $100 billion in annual run-rate sales AWS is currently pacing is truly the tip of the iceberg. Despite accounting for only 17.5% of net sales in the March-ended quarter, AWS and its considerably higher margins generated 61.5% of Amazon's quarterly operating income.\n\nSubscription services, such as Prime, provide another source of steady double-digit growth. Prime surpassed 200 million global subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this figure since securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football. Football is the most-watched sport in the U.S. by a mile!\n\nLastly, Amazon is capitalizing on the more than 2 billion visitors it draws to its site each month. Advertising services revenue jumped by 24% on a constant-currency basis in the March-ended quarter and has continued a streak of 20%-plus year-over-year growth dating back two years.\n\nAt the end of the day, Amazon is a cash flow machine. Whereas investors regularly paid a multiple of 23 to 37 times cash flow to own shares of this juggernaut throughout the 2010s, long-term-minded growth seekers can scoop up shares of Amazon right now for about 12 times consensus cash flow estimates in 2025. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIntel\n\nThe third Dow stock that makes for a no-brainer buy in May is beaten-down semiconductor stalwart Intel(NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nUnlike Chevron and Amazon, Intel isn't firing on all cylinders right now. Its bottom line is being weighed down by weaker demand for personal computers (PCs) and expansive losses from its Foundry Services segment. History tells us that turnarounds in semiconductor stocks often take years.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a number of identifiable catalysts that suggest the pessimism surrounding Intel has become excessive.\n\nFor example, Intel's central processing unit (CPU) share in PCs and data centers has been under pressure for years. Core rival Advanced Micro Devices has been siphoning away share in PCs. Despite these losses, Intel still absolutely dominates in PC and traditional data center CPU market share. Even though these segments aren't the growth story they once were, they're providing Intel with bountiful operating cash flow that it can use to reinvest in other high-growth initiatives.\n\nIntel isn't sitting on its laurels when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, either. It recently unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip that'll be going head-to-head with Nvidia's market-leading H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). Considering how scarce high-powered GPUs were in 2023, Gaudi 3 should be in high demand for businesses looking to train large language models and run generative AI solutions.\n\nAlthough building its Foundry Services segment from the ground up isn't cheap, this looks to be the trough year for Intel's chip fabrication operations. Intel has the tools to become the world's No. 2 foundry services provider by the turn of the decade.\n\nWith Intel's EPS expected to nearly quadruple by 2027 to north of $4, now looks like the perfect time for long-term-minded investors to pounce.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AMZN vs. META: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is Better?",
        "content": "In this piece, I evaluated two of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool below to see which is better. A closer look suggests a bullish view for Amazon and a neutral view for Meta.\n\nOf course, neither company needs an introduction, but Amazon is an e-commerce and cloud-computing giant, while Meta Platforms owns and operates several social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others.\n\nShares of Amazon are up 15% year-to-date and have soared 69% over the last year, while Meta Platforms stock is up 22% year-to-date and 80% over the last 12 months.\n\nAlthough their year-to-date performances are somewhat similar, that’s where the similarities between these two companies end. While both are part of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks, they operate in totally different businesses despite both having a technology bent.\n\nHowever, a closer look at their latest earnings results and the market’s reactions to those reports reveals something very interesting. In short, investors initially rewarded one for spending more on artificial intelligence technology and punished the other for the same thing.\n\nIt seems clear that both Amazon and Meta Platforms could benefit from improved AI technology, but unfortunately, this sort of manic-depressive behavior is commonplace on Wall Street right now. Let’s see if those totally opposite reactions were warranted.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAt a P/E of 50.9x, Amazon is trading at a discount to its five-year mean price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 72.2x. Its forward P/E of about 36.4x is also quite attractive and suggests analysts are projecting significant increases in earnings over the next 12 months. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate, especially considering the cloud computing results in Amazon’s latest earnings report.\n\nFor the first quarter, Amazon reported adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share on $143.3 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of 84 cents per share on $142.5 billion in revenue. Sales in North America rose 12% year-over-year to $86.3 billion, while international sales grew 10% year-over-year to $31.9 billion. Revenues in the cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), surged 17% year-over-year to reach $25 billion.\n\nAmazon’s management guided for second-quarter revenue of $144 billion to $149 billion, which came up short of the consensus estimate of $150.1 billion, and operating income to be between $10 billion and $14 billion. Analysts are also projecting adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share for the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Amazon stock initially dropped after the April 30 earnings release, it recovered quickly, soaring from about $179 before the release to around $185 now. This action is particularly interesting in light of the company’s disappointing guidance, as the Street has typically been punishing companies that come up short of expectations in their outlooks.\n\nHowever, the initial post-earnings drop could have been due to the press release with the disappointing guidance, with the rebound coming after the earnings call. On that call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed the recently achieved $100 billion annual revenue run rate for AWS to their AI-related enhancements.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney also told clients in a note on Tuesday that it was the first quarter since Q3 2022 in which AWS’s total-dollar revenue growth surpassed that of Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. In fact, AWS is becoming more profitable as well, with its operating income jumping 84% to $9.4 billion and its operating margin expanding to 37.6% from 24% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAll of this adds up to a bright future for Amazon, which suggests that it’s meaningfully undervalued at current multiples.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?\n\nAmazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $213.74, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of 18.65%.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\n\nAt its current P/E of about 25.1x, Meta Platforms is trading roughly in line with its five-year mean P/E of about 26.5x. Its forward P/E of 21.6x suggests analysts are looking for a relatively small earnings increase over the next 12 months, but it’s not a significant drop between the current and forward P/E, suggesting a bit more stability rather than soaring earnings to come. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate, especially considering a key piece of the latest earnings report.\n\nMeta Platforms posted its latest earnings results on April 24, reporting adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share on $36.45 billion in revenue versus the consensus numbers of $4.32 per share on $36.15 billion in revenue. However, investors were displeased with the company’s revised outlook, which boosted its expected capital expenditures.\n\nMeta now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion on capital expenditures (capex) this year, up from the previous guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. The company said those increased capex will enable it to speed up its infrastructure investments in support of its AI roadmap.\n\nMeta stock plunged $50 following that release, as investors actually penalized the company for its increased AI spending. However, a key difference from Amazon is that Amazon is already showing results from its AI investments, while Meta is merely planning for future AI enhancements. Of course, Meta has already rolled out some AI enhancements, like its AI chatbot, but it clearly is planning much more with that sizable increase in capex.\n\nAdditionally, Meta’s Reality Labs division continues to report sizable losses, so investors may be concerned about the company’s ability to transform new technologies into profits. In the first quarter, Reality Labs posted a loss of $3.85 billion, bringing its losses to more than $45 billion since the end of 2020.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for META Stock?\n\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $530.93, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies upside potential of 20.2%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on AMZN, Neutral on META\n\nWhile it’s hard to go wrong with Amazon or Meta Platforms, Amazon is the clear winner of this pairing due to its valuation, successful implementation of AI to boost demand, and results from its cloud computing division, AWS.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta’s AI ambitions are incomplete as it significantly boosts spending on AI. As a result, those AI efforts look like a bit of a show-me story, at least until the capital is spent and we see the results of those ambitions. It’s understandable that investors would be concerned about Meta’s ability to turn its new technologies into earnings based on the Reality Labs losses that are piling up.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Plug Power Stock Could Be the Ultimate Comeback Kid of the Decade",
        "content": "Wall Street continues to dislike Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) because it is losing large amounts of money, and the Street has little or no tolerance for such companies because interest rates are high.\n\nMoreover, many of those who believe that higher-for-longer rates will inevitably doom such firms are selling short the shares of companies like Plug Power. They view such names as easy targets.\n\nAnd yet, the longer-term outlook of Plug Power stock remains positive, driven by the continued, relatively rapid progress that the firm is making on becoming a green hydrogen powerhouse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the firm’s achievements so far and its huge opportunities, I continue to view PLUG as a buy for risk-tolerant growth investors.\n\nPlug Power Continues to Make Progress\n\nOn April 23, Plug Power announced that its Georgia and Tennessee green hydrogen plants had reached their maximum capacity. Specifically, the Georgia facility is producing 15 tons per day of green hydrogen, while the Tennessee plant is generating 10 tons per day.\n\nAs a result, the company is supplying about 50% of its customers’ fuel demand using the hydrogen that it’s producing on its own. That figure should reach about 70%, according to my calculations, when the firm adds the Louisiana plant, which is expected to be completed next quarter, into the mix. And the firm says that it’s “doing substantial work on other U.S.-based [green hydrogen] plants.”\n\nMeanwhile, Plug’s electrolyzer business is continuing to rapidly grow. Electrolyzers are used to manufacture green hydrogen. On April 25, PLUG disclosed that it had made two new deals to build electrolyzers that will have a cumulative capacity of 350 megawatts. The firm now has an impressive total of 4.5 gigawatts of such deals.\n\nGross Margins Keep Rising\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, Plug has said that “it can churn out green hydrogen for $3 to $5 per kilogram” and sell it for $6 to $7 per kilogram.\n\nMeanwhile, it has stated that it raised its prices for the fuel earlier this year, and it noted that the U.S. is going to implement “tax credits of up to $3 per kilogram for green hydrogen.” As I noted in the previous article, that means that “PLUG’s gross margin for the green hydrogen that it produces could exceed $7 per kilogram in some cases and will be over $1 per kilogram at the lowest.”\n\nIn March, CFO Paul Middleton reported that the gross margin of the company’s green hydrogen-making equipment business would reach the upper 30% range in the medium term. He stated that the business’s gross margins would rise significantly towards that goal this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Demand for Green Hydrogen Persists\n\nGE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) is a major provider of equipment for natural gas power plants. On the company’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Scott Strazik reported that GEV’s “customers are focused on how [natural gas] capacity additions this decade can be decarbonized in the next decade with both hydrogen and carbon capture.” Based on Strazik’s statement, I think it’s clear that many power producers are going to purchase a great deal of green hydrogen, which produces little or no carbon emissions, in the long term.\n\nMuch sooner than that, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have both agreed to buy large amounts of green hydrogen from Plug Power starting next year. Since they are looking to use green hydrogen to decarbonize their truck fleets, I predict that many other retailers will likely take the same approach. And Plug CEO Andy Marsh has said that the company could start providing fuel cells to data centers on a major scale at the end of next year.\n\nPLUG Does Pose Risk, But It Should Pull Through\n\nPlug burned $380 million of cash last year and $1.58 billion of cash in 2022, while it had just $135 million of cash and short-term investments as of the end of 2023. Additionally, its low stock price will make it harder for the firm to use its shares to generate cash and compensate its employees. Given these points, buying PLUG stock is not for the faint of heart,\n\nBut Plug Power maintains that it has ways to raise more cash relatively easily. Moreover, the firm is relatively confident that it will receive a $1.6 billion loan from the Department of Energy by the end of the year.\n\nGiven these points, along with all of the firm’s upcoming, positive catalysts, I believe that it will survive and ultimately thrive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in PLUG, AMZN, and GEV.

        "content": "There are some REITs to avoid in this continued “higher for longer” interest rate environment. These investment vehicles are particularly sensitive to rising interest rates due to their reliance on debt financing. In this economic climate, REITs with high leverage ratios, short-term debt maturities and limited cash flows may struggle to maintain profitability and dividend payouts.\n\nMoreover, certain sectors within the REIT universe are more vulnerable than others. For instance, mortgage REITs (mREITs), which invest in mortgage-backed securities, are directly impacted by interest rate fluctuations.\n\nAlthough REITs can be great for income investors and a moderate diversifier in a balanced portfolio, overexposed to this sector can be especially risky, amplified when buying shares of trusts with shaky fundamentals. All of this would be amplified in a stock market crash.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are three REITs to avoid in May this year.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) Dark server room that's illuminated by blue lights and features numerous rows of server units\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) focuses on data centers and digital infrastructure. Concerns arise from rising interest rates and potential oversupply in the data center market.\n\nDLR saw a revenue decrease of 2% in Q4 2023 compared to Q3. However, its net income for\r\n2023 increased by 18.8%. The company reported revenues of $1.4 billion for Q4 2023, with a projected revenue range in 2024 between $5.55 billion and $5.65 billion.\n\nRecent developments include a $7 billion joint venture deal with Blackstone to capture further opportunities in the data center market.\n\nSome issues with DLR make it unappealing. First, its dividend hasn’t been raised since March 14, 2022. However, its stock price has grown by 45.64% over the past year.\n\nBut all this capital appreciation also comes with an inbuilt assumption that it will continue growing aggressively. Its P/E of 46 times earnings evidences this. With a REIT offering little income appreciation and expensive shares, it operates more like a growth stock than an income-generating asset.\n\nSimon Property Group (SPG) building facade of simon property group (SPG)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) specializes in retail real estate, including shopping malls and outlets. The decline of brick-and-mortar retail due to e-commerce competition and consumer behavior changes poses a significant risk.\r\n\r\nFor Q4 2023, the company reported an FFO of $1.38 billion and a projected FFO of $11.85 to $12.10 per share for 2024. The retail real estate portfolio showed resilience despite challenges posed by e-commerce and changing consumer behavior​. Its fundamentals also soared, with record funds from operations (FFO) reaching $4.7 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite e-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) becoming a staple of our lives, nothing can quite replace the experience of in-person shopping.\n\nHowever, I am concerned that this will remain the status quo. SPG isn’t a growing company, and when examining its EBITDA from 2016 to 2023, it oscillated around the average of $4,315 million, mirroring its top-line.\n\nSPG’s stagnation reflects the stubborn resilience of retail, and both may be unappealing from a growth aspect.\n\nOffice Properties Income Trust (OPI) A 3D render of a virtual city environment.\n\nSource: Immersion Imagery / Shutterstock.com\n\nOffice Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ:OPI) focuses on office properties across the United States.\n\nOPI reported a challenging 2023 performance, with revenues declining by 3.7% to $533.55 million compared to 2022. The company saw a significant drop in its stock price throughout 2023, leading to a total return of negative 35.7%. In Q4 2023, OPI reported a net loss of $37.2 million and saw a dividend reduction.\n\nA dividend cut is enough for many investors to consider throwing OPI in the bin. Amazingly, OPI only pays a 2% dividend yield despite its stock price falling 71.91% year-to-date. This can be chalked up to its dividend growth rate cratering to 96%.\n\nSome investors are holding on, with its market cap still at $97 million. There’s a high likelihood that things will get worse than this. OPI is therefore a very high risk play with little perceivable upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The newly adopted CrowdStrike products replace some tools Amazon developed itself, he said, as well as products from “individual niche players” that he declined to name.\n\nCrowdStrike Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said the expanded use by Amazon fits with what his firm has seen from other customers — a desire for simple, unified cybersecurity products.“They want to consolidate to fewer vendors,” Kurtz said, echoing a point previously made by analysts and competitors including Microsoft Corp., the biggest seller of cybersecurity products.\n\n(Updates with share price in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "25 Most Profitable Companies in the US",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the US. If you want to skip our overview of the US economy and the current business climate, you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\nWith the second quarter of 2024 with us, Wall Street is focused on determining whether companies that are investing in AI are actually bringing in money or whether they are investing costly capital to set themselves up for future growth. Firms that belong to the former sector, i.e. those that are making money from AI, have been rewarded as has been the case with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Just like NVIDIA is Wall Street's favorite AI stock when it comes to semiconductors needed to power up large data processing software, Microsoft is the king of the jungle when it comes to AI software. In the latter segment, the best example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares have dropped after the latest earnings report revealed that 2024 will require an additional $40 billion in capital to fund AI growth.\n\nThis sharp eye on AI comes when investors are grappling with an economy that might be starting to slow down just as the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to tamp down on inflation. While the AI gold rush of 2023 put inflation and other macroeconomic indicators on the backdrop, after the inflation data for March 2024, they are back in the spotlight. This environment, which has left investors eager to flee away from stocks once again comes as profitability becomes key, particularly as profits are important to enable firms to position themselves for growth (such as is the case with AI stocks) or keep investors happy by paying out dividends.\n\nUS companies are also some of the biggest in the world when it comes to profits. America's corporate sector, particularly the technology industry, is the most developed in the world. Firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are able to compete with the world's largest state owned enterprises when it comes to revenue. In fact, Apple is the first company in the world that has proven that technology and personal computing is a more lucrative industry than oil - a commodity that is responsible for powering daily lives. To understand how, consider that Apple's trailing twelve month revenue as of December 2023 sits at a whopping $385 billion.\n\nNow, compare this with the net sales of the Saudi state owned oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), which has raked in SAR2 trillion during the same time period. Using an exchange rate of 3.75 SAR to a dollar leads to approximately $530 billion in revenue for the Saudi oil giant. While naturally, Aramco's revenue is higher since it does not have any comparable competitors on a global level, the fact that a consumer technology firm that is dependent not only on the need to stay abreast with innovation but also with what its rivals are doing is able to earn more than half of the revenue is something in itself to say the least.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a whole, Insider Monkey also looked at the 30 Largest Companies in the World by Revenue. This shows that US companies reign supreme even though Aramco enjoys free access to the vast global crude oil market. The US retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) tops this list courtesy of its $648 billion in sales, showing that a well run privately owned company has the full potential to take on massive state owned giants.\n\nBut what about profits? After all, even if a firm makes hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, its investors get nothing if money does not flow through the income statement and into retained earnings. Today, we'll look at some of the most profitable companies in America, with a couple of top picks being Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 25 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\nPhoto by Christian Dubovan on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most profitable companies in the US, we ranked all publicly listed US firms by their trailing twelve month net income available on Yahoo Finance and picked out those with the highest profit.\n\n25 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\n25.

        "title": "Top 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 by Index Weight Right Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by index weight right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the flagship stock index and some recent news for its biggest constituents then you can skip ahead to Top 10 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now.\n\nThe S&P 500 plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, politics, and the finance industry. This is because it is one of the most widely followed barometer of the economy, with investors and finance professionals using its data to inform their daily decision making. For politicians, a rising index means that they can boast to voters for having managed the economy well. For finance professionals, they can rest easy knowing that the pricey bets that they might have made on the stock market are doing well.\n\nWhen compared to other indexes, the S&P 500, managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), is particularly important because of the stringent conditions that a firm must meet to be included in it. For starters, only sizeable large cap stocks, or those with a market capitalization greater than $18 billion can be included in the index. These large cap stocks must also be highly liquid, generate most of their revenue in America, and of course, be profitable. These criteria remove most firms that might not do well financially, and as a result, the S&P is also recommended as a great passive investment.\n\nShifting to its performance, 2024 has been a fireworks filled year for the S&P 500. The index is up by 6.9% year to date, after it also crossed the illustrious 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history. In fact, year to March 28, 2024 the index had marked 11% in gains, but it ended up losing these after the inflation data for the month led to investors significantly revising their Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations for 2024.\n\nIn April, while the index did end up revaluing itself in the wake of shifting rate cut paradigms, the first quarter of 2024 earnings season marked by Wall Street's enduring focus on artificial intelligence seems to have injected some life into it. The season, at least as far as artificial intelligence and technology stocks are concerned, started by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sharing its latest financial performance on April 24th. Meta's results led to tens of billions of dollars in market value being wiped out as investors didn't take too well to $40 billion in AI spending for 2024 at a time when expenses were growing. These were followed by results from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which were more favorably received. If anything, the latest earnings reports have at least stopped the S&P 500 from bleeding further losses, and right now, Wall Street is focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of April.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this meeting is not expected to yield a rate cut, the focus, as always, is on comments made by the Fed after its meetings. These comments help set the tone for future monetary policy actions, and traders will also focus on earnings from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to see whether there's any juice left for more growth. Google parent Alphabet's earnings came with a nice surprise for investors in the form of a dividend, and Wall Street is now focused on whether Amazon will follow suit.\n\nHowever, while the economic picture on the surface might point to fewer Fed interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 might surprise by posting gains if the central bank overshoots market expectations or considers economic weakness more strongly than expected. Just what might force the Fed to swing the other way despite hot inflation and labor costs? Olivia Micklem of Artemis Investment has some insights:\n\nObviously we can see with the data that's been coming through in recent weeks that inflation continues to run hotter than we would have liked to see at this point in the year. That being said, alongside that we are starting to see pockets of weakness in the economy whether that's parts of the consumer economy and other parts of the industrial complex. We got some softer number out of some of the trucking companies last week, for example. So there are indications that some parts of the economy are slowing down. I think we still remain you know cautiously optimistic that there could be an opportunity as we move through the year for the Fed to stay on track with some of their plans to start bringing rates down.\n\nSo, with the S&P 500's future remaining as dynamic as ever, we decided to look at which stocks have been assigned the highest weights by its managers. A few notable ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 5 Reasons Why Millionaires Think They’re Middle Class\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the top S&P 500 stocks by weight, we used the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a proxy and verified the data by the S&P's limited publicly available information about the S&P 500's top ten stocks.\n\nTop 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now\n\n25.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Alert: 3 Must-Buy Warren Buffett Stocks When Prices Plunge",
        "content": "There is probably no investor more closely scrutinized than Warren Buffett. Whether by Wall Street analysts or individual investors, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) has his every buy, sell and hold decision dissected six ways to Sunday.\n\nAnd it’s not without cause. Since becoming CEO at Berkshire in 1964, Buffett has generated over 4.7 million percent returns for investors. That’s a mind-boggling figure, particularly since the S&P 500 has only returned around 30,000%. Following Buffett’s moves might not be such a bad investing strategy.\n\nWhat you will find is that while the Oracle of Omaha doesn’t mind picking up shares of stocks he owns when they’re rising, he will often scoop up handfuls when they fall. Buying stocks when they go on sale is a tried and true method of creating vast wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three Warren Buffett stocks to buy when prices tumble.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) on a gas station roof.\n\nSource: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is riding a wave of fossil fuel demand higher. Global production is going to increase to help meet the need but not by nearly enough to offset rising demand. That will cause prices to increase and lift Chevron’s bottom line.\n\nThe second-largest integrated oil and gas stock behind Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron will profit at each stage of energy’s lifecycle. From exploration and production to refining and transportation, to downstream retail sales, Chevron will have its fingers it the pie.\n\nYet the oil industry no longer engages in willy-nilly exploration. While that used to be an industry staple, Chevron, Exxon and others now take a more cautious and selective approach. More often than not, project development is reserved for only the most profitable projects. It is a more sustainable policy long term.\n\nConsolidation is still key to further enhancements. Chevron is looking to acquire peer Hess (NYSE:HES) and its assets in Guyana. It could actually be a trigger for the stock to tumble, though, because Exxon says it has the right of first refusal of the assets. If Exxon wins, CVX stock could fall. That would be an excellent opportunity to acquire shares for the rebound.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) TMUS stock\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nTelecommunications industry leader T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is another stock to buy on a pullback. The wireless carrier’s shares are up 31% from their lows. Yet they could fall again as the year progresses.\n\nT-Mobile leaped to the forefront of the mobile market, adding more customers than its rivals over an extended period of time. But that’s about to change.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its just-reported first quarter earnings report, management left unchanged its expectations for postpaid phone customer increases even as it raised both profitability and free cash flow growth. Over the next few quarters, T-Mobile will begin implementing its “rate plan optimizations” program. It expects that will boost revenue per postpaid account 3% this year instead of the 2% previously forecast.\n\nThose price hikes will temper customer acquisitions, which could cause the market to react negatively. As T-Mobile bolsters its bottom line, any pullback in the stock ought to be exploited. The carrier is improving the long-term health of the business at the expense of short-term catalysts, which is better for T-Mobile stock and investors overall.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nSupermarket giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) is the last Warren Buffett stock to buy if prices plunge. Even as its stock is up 22% in 2024, there are plenty of factors that could see it reverse course.\n\nKroger is still trying to buy rival Albertson’s (NYSE:ACI) amid ongoing opposition from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Due to an apparent lack of understanding of market dynamics, the agency’s antitrust lawyers ignore the very real competitive threats grocery stores face. While alleging the merger will lead to higher prices for groceries, lower quality products and services, and limit choices for consumers, they willfully ignore the threat Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Aldi, Lidl, and even e-commerce platforms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) present.\n\nThe Biden administration has essentially become the man with a hammer: everything looks like a nail. The agency has taken an almost blanket approach to denying large M&A transactions. It recently sued to stop Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) from buying Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), opposed JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) buying Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ:SAVE), and tried to squash Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Notably, the FTC has lost every single case it has opposed that went to court (like the Microsoft case) but many takeovers were also abandoned.\n\nKilling the Albertson’s deal could crush Kroger stock. However, because Kroger is the largest pure-play supermarket chain with over 2,700 stores, it should remain a solid Buffett stock to buy in the event of prices crumbling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CVX and XOM stock.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy made comments to the media in 2022 that violated federal labor law, a US National Labor Relations Board judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East Tesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market NYPD Arrests Over 300 Protesters in Crackdown on College Campuses Jerome Powell Offered Markets a Reprieve. It Vanished in a Blink The Ozempic Effect: How a Weight Loss Wonder Drug Gobbled Up an Entire Economy\n\nRemarks that Jassy made to reporters about the downsides of unionization told “employees that, if they selected a union, they would become less empowered and would find it harder to get things done quickly,” NLRB administrative law judge Brian Gee wrote.\n\nGee cited various comments Jassy made, including telling CNBC that making workplace improvements is “much slower” with a union and saying at a New York Times conference that employees without a union are “better off” because “it’s not bureaucratic.”\n\nGee also cited Jassy for telling the Bloomberg Technology Summit that in a union shop, “if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or your customers, you can’t just go to your manager and say, ‘Let’s change it.’”\n\nWhile precedent establishes that a manager can make factually based predictions about “demonstrably probable consequences beyond his control,” Gee wrote that Jassy “offered no objective basis” for his assertions.\n\nThe judge said Amazon should be forced to post a notice at its US facilities informing employees of their rights and committing not to threaten them.\n\nAmazon said it strongly disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal. “The decision reflects poorly on the state of free speech rights today, and we remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to engage in a reasonable discussion on these issues where all perspectives have an opportunity to be heard,” spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said in an email.\n\nThe Amazon Labor Union, which brought the case to the NLRB, celebrated the ruling. “It sends a clear message that attempts to dissuade workers from exercising their right to organize and bargain collectively will not be tolerated,” the union’s attorney, Seth Goldstein, said in a text message.\n\nUS law allows companies to oppose and argue against unionization, but not to threaten to punish workers if they organize.\n\nRulings by NLRB judges can be appealed to labor board members in Washington, and from there into federal court. The agency lacks the authority to hold executives personally liable for violations or make companies pay punitive damages.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with Amazon’s response starting in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "content": "Amazon AMZN was the latest tech giant to impressively top Q1 expectations reporting after market hours on Tuesday and seeing its stock spike +2% in today’s trading session.\n\nAs part of the “Magnificent Seven”,  Amazon has continued to lift the market’s performance in recent years with AMZN now up +18% year to date. That said, let’s review Amazon’s Q1 results and see why now may still be a good time to buy stock in the e-commerce behemoth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ1 Review & Cloud Growth\n\nAmazon’s AWS cloud computing segment fueled its strong Q1 results driven by growth in generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across various industries. First quarter sales increased 12% to $143.3 billion and came in slightly above estimates of $142.52 billion. AWS contributed $25 billion to the top line, beating estimates by 3% and increasing 17% year over year as Amazon remains the domestic cloud leader ahead of Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMore importantly, Amazon’s operating income skyrocketed 221% to 15.3 billion. This led to earnings of $1.13 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus of $0.83 a share by 36% and climbed from $0.31 a share in the comparative quarter. Notably, Amazon has now exceeded earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters and has posted an average earnings surprise of 48.17% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ2 Revenue Guidance\n\nFor the second quarter, Amazon expects net sales to be between $144-$149 billion or 7%-11% growth which falls slightly below the current Zacks Consensus of $150.21 billion or roughly 12% growth (Current Qtr below). According to Zacks estimates, Amazon’s total sales are projected to expand 11% this year and jump another 11% in fiscal 2025 to $716.01 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAverage Zacks Price Target\n\nWith many analysts raising their price targets for Amazon’s stock this morning including those of UBS and Oppenheimer, it's noteworthy that the Average Zacks Price Target of $209.95 suggests 20% upside from current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt the moment, Amazon's stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Although Amazon’s revenue guidance fell slightly below the Zacks Consensus, earnings estimate revisions could go up after the company comfortably exceeded Q1 EPS estimates and posted strong growth outside of its e-commerce buisness.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Sometimes a company’s debut or the release of a new product can stir analysts into a frenzy. Other times, careful consideration of long-term trends and performance can drive improved public opinion of a company’s prospects. In such cases, the resulting market conditions offer stocks with analyst recommendations that simply cannot be ignored.\n\nThat’s because the process of determining which stocks to buy can often be subject to emotions and hype. This pitfall is possible for both institutional analysts and retail investors I like. One way to hedge against these potential hype trains is to understand the underlying purpose as to why analysts may reach a consensus on a specific security.\n\nBy performing individual analyses based on mathematical factors such as price-to-earnings ratios or market growth extrapolations, investors filter out emotion. Ultimately, it comes down to two factors: how much risk you can stomach, and making sure you only invest in what you understand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIQVIA Holdings (IQV) OLK Stock.

RSLS stock. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nAiming to solve one of the biggest hurdles in the biotech center, IQVIA Holdings (NYSE:IQV) presents a new way to profit from the biotech industry. Specifically, the company focuses on creating frameworks both from a population and analytical perspective for companies to undergo regulatory trials. This allows biotech companies to outsource their testing process and procedures to IQVIA and significantly reduce the costs of performing regulatory trials\n\nMoreover, the company can leverage its experience in analytics to apply it to various projects that may have structural overlap. One such example is the company’s 4,600 data scientists and 1,300 medical doctors who work together to consistently perfect the process of medication testing.\n\nIQVIA’s future looks even brighter when, because of all of these methodologies and records, the company accrues from providing testing services, enabling it to become even more efficient on future projects. This has allowed the company to develop over 30 different predictive disease detection solutions while growing the company’s financial strength in parallel.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts have been buzzing about Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) in recent months, partly due to the company’s low-cost business model proving incredibly lucrative. As a designer of silicone boards for microchips, the company has been able to capitalize on licensing its designs and its supporting software. This makes the true value of Synopsys its intellectual properties rather than any one specific product.\n\nStory continues\n\nSynopsys has been among the most talked about stocks with analyst recommendations supporting its earning potential since its Q1 earnings report for 2024. The company was able to increase revenue by 21.15% year-over-year to $1.65 billion while also raising its net income by 65.40% to $449 million. Since then, major publications like Kiplinger and Morningstar have been bullish about the stock’s potential future value.\n\nFrom my perspective, SNPS could be incredibly lucrative should the advances in AI keep rolling out, as many of its major revenue drivers rely on the technology’s adoption.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou don’t have to be an analyst to understand why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been so exceptionally popular lately. From its continuous growth and vertical processes to its commitment to constantly expanding into new industries, the company has maintained a steadily rising share price for years.\n\nYet, the bullish opinions are more related to Amazon’s future position as a cloud computing giant as the world becomes ever more connected. I have also recommended Amazon several times in the past and continue to see the company as a stable investment. In my eyes, the company has exceptional diversification on its technological side, with the Amazon Web Services division reporting consistent growth year-over-year.\n\nThese kinds of decisions are indicative of a company that will continue to perform well into the future since it touches so many different business sectors and individuals. As such, it’s easy to understand why Amazon is one of the best stocks with analyst recommendations so unanimously positive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Penny stocks are on the riskier end of the public equity spectrum. They are characterized by their low volume, affordable pricing, and the rapid pace at which their values can surge or plummet compared to more traditional stocks. But, for well-informed investors, penny stocks offer a chance to secure substantial gains on the cheap.\n\nWhen considering penny stocks, remember to objectively and critically review the company’s operational opportunity and its long-term viability. To avoid falling into a “pump and dump” trap, thoroughly assess the viability of the company’s products and confirm the firm’s potential for sustained growth. These companies, while not all profitable, still have sufficient positive factors informing a bullish outlook and could see shares surging sooner rather than later.\n\nBridger Aerospace (BAER) picture of a forest with mountains in the distance\n\nSource: shutterstock\n\nBridger Aerospace (NASDAQ:BAER), is a relative newcomer to the penny stock scene, having listed in early 2023 and trading nearly 50% below post-SPAC merger completion. Despite this drop, the penny stock is poised for a promising future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBridger Aerospace specializes in aerial firefighting, providing a fleet of aircraft that support rural wilderness firefighting efforts—an expansive and diverse industry. To gauge Bridger’s potential market, consider California’s budget: for the 2022 – 2023 fiscal year, the state dedicated $3.3 billion to firefighting efforts, including aerial suppression. With wildfires becoming a persistent challenge, funding will likely increase from here.\n\nAlthough profits remain modest, Bridger reported record end-of-year revenue and income in its latest financial statement. Additionally, its fleet achieved record utilization levels as more government agencies, both domestic and international, sought Bridger’s services. Despite its small size, Bridger Aerospace stands on solid financial ground with a compelling value proposition in a necessary industry.\n\nPenny Stocks to Buy: Westrock Coffee (WEST) NUZE Stock. A photo of a cup of coffee and some coffee beans and a towel on a wooden table. Coffee stocks\n\nSource: Evgeny Karandaev/ShutterStock.com\n\nWestrock Coffee (NASDAQ:WEST) is also a fairly new penny stock, having completed its SPAC merger in late 2022. Despite debuting amid optimism, its shares currently trade right around the listing price, but recent moves may indicate an imminent upside.\n\nFirst and most noteworthy, Westrock insiders are snagging as many shares as they can — indicating management feels momentum is set to surge. The company’s co-founder and chairman recently bought more than $400,000 worth of WEST stock, and the company’s insider flows slant heavily to the buy side.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps management sees a turnaround imminent, as evidenced by the company’s recent end-of-year filings. Despite a slight sales slump, the company’s profitability prospects improved considerably and lost “just” $20 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a more sizable $40 million dollar in the previous year’s same period. Coffee is a tough sector to penetrate, but as consumer sentiment rebounds and Westrock finds its footing, this penny stock may see itself reenergize rapidly.\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (YYAI) A hand holding a magnifying glass over pennies. under-$1 stocks to buy. penny stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (NASDAQ:YYAI) stands out as a unique penny stock tapping into emerging sports trends. The company leverages its proprietary Slinger Bag to target specific sports like pickleball, which is gaining traction in the U.S., padel, popular in Mexico, and the evergreen favorite, tennis. These niche markets allow Connexa to engage consumers directly with targeted, high-quality advertising campaigns, ensuring the longevity and growth of its products. This approach positions Connexa as a promising growth-oriented penny stock, especially as enthusiasm for outdoor sports picks up in the spring and summer.\n\nIn 2023, short sellers targeted Connexa, driving its share price down by over 70% and necessitating a reverse stock split. However, the tide turned as new strategic investors entered the scene, catapulting the stock’s value by over 275% since January. This surge indicates strong momentum for Connexa’s future prospects, particularly as we enter summer sports season and see greater numbers of consumers readying their gear.\n\nPenny Stocks to Buy: Clearpoint Neuro (CLPT) Medicine and healthcare concept - team or group of doctors and nurses\n\nSource: Supavadee butradee / Shutterstock.com\n\nHealthcare penny stock ClearPoint Neuro (NASDAQ:CLPT) is struggling this month, falling about 20% since April 1st. Still, the company’s flagship ClearPoint platform aids surgical providers in navigating the brain and related systems to diagnose and treat neurological disorders, meaning its tech has strong potential to expand into existing healthcare networks. At the same time, a string of regulatory approvals could spark a stock surge soon.\n\nThe most significant of these approvals came from the FDA, which greenlit the clinical use of ClearPoint’s SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System. This system enhances the delivery of directed radiation therapy during stereotactic radiosurgery, a non-invasive alternative that targets cancerous areas with radiation to damage cells and shrink tumors without open surgery.\n\nImportantly, this platform can be used in the operating room, moving beyond the previous requirement for an MRI setting. Joe Burnett, President and CEO, emphasized its potential: “More than 95% of all stereotactic neuro-navigation procedures occur in the OR. This product, the first in ClearPoint’s history not to require MRI use during the procedure, allows us to reach more hospitals and support significantly more patients than our legacy products.”\n\nMoreover, ClearPoint also received approval from European Union regulators to distribute its existing products on the continent, thereby broadening its market reach and enhancing its total addressable market.\n\niRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) Roomba vacuum cleaner robots powerful cleaning system with intelligent sensors to clean Pet hair, crumbs, dirt, and daily dust\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough its per-share price of about $8 might not categorize it as a penny stock, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has a market cap under $250 million, smaller than several stocks on our list. Despite its modest size, iRobot is positioned as a potential comeback story of the year. A shift in circumstances could trigger unstoppable momentum for this robotics stock, irrespective of broader market conditions.\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) failed acquisition highlighted the value of iRobot’s extensive patent and intellectual property portfolio. Although robotic vacuum sales have recently slowed, iRobot’s advanced technology remains attractive to potential acquirers and investors. With the robotics sector undergoing a renaissance, iRobot emerges as one of the few household names poised to capture significant attention from both institutional and retail investors as this trend advances.\n\nEven without banking on mergers and acquisitions, iRobot’s future looks promising. The company is actively optimizing its operations to survive in a competitive small-cap market. It recently reported a 26% improvement in per-share earnings, and despite the boost, iRobot’s stock is trading at just 0.27x sales, marking it as a distinctive penny stock value play with substantial growth potential.\n\nPenny Stocks to Buy: indie Semiconductor (INDI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOver the past year, semiconductor stocks have surged, but giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) face massive overvaluation as demand remains high. As a result, investors are shifting their focus to penny stock semiconductor companies in search of the “next big thing.” indie Semiconductor (NASDAQ:INDI) stands out in this segment, primarily focusing on semiconductors for automotive and self-driving car applications—a sector seeing increased demand due to rising new car sales and consumer desires for advanced features like driver assistance and sophisticated infotainment systems.\n\nIn 2023, indie Semiconductor achieved a record revenue of $223.2 million, marking a surge of over 100%. Moreover, the company’s profit margins impressively reached 52.5%, showing an improvement of more than 2.5% from the previous year. This expansion in margins demonstrates that indie Semiconductor is not only adapting to changing economic conditions but is also excelling by enhancing efficiencies and reducing costs without compromising on quality.\n\nLithium Americas (LAAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAAC) is among the penny stocks making notable moves this year, even amid a sluggish lithium market. However, trends could pivot in 2024, potentially propelling this Argentinian-focused mining stock upward. The demand for lithium, largely fueled by battery innovation and renewable energy shifts, is expected to increase by over 30% annually through 2030.\n\nLike its industry peers, Lithium Americas faced challenges in 2023 with slow demand and significant oversupply, leading to depressed spot prices. However, demand is picking up speed, and some analysts are forecasting an upcoming undersupply, which could push spot prices higher, favoring Lithium Americas.\n\nEnhancing this outlook, Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei, is boosting optimism around the lithium-rich region’s mining prospects. He aims to ease operational barriers for mining and has even discussed this potential with Elon Musk, considering lithium’s crucial role in electric vehicle production.\n\nTrading below its book value and at a reduced price-to-forward earnings ratio compared to recent years, Lithium Americas presents itself as a compelling commodity penny stock poised for significant gains as market and economic forces realign.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "(Adds no comment from FTC, more details)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The chair of the House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday he is investigating the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) work with the European Commission in the collapse of Amazon.com's plan to acquire iRobot Corp in a $1.4 billion deal.\n\nAmazon and robot vacuum maker iRobot in January dropped their plans to tie-up in the face of opposition from European and U.S. antitrust regulators.\n\n\"The FTC’s anticompetitive actions threaten to harm America’s global position in the personal robotics market, while ceding market share of personal robotics to foreign entities such as China,\" Republican Representative James Comer said in a letter to the FTC asking for documents shared by the FTC with the European Commission. \"The FTC’s actions indicate to American businesses that the FTC will work outside of U.S. antitrust law by using the EC to realize its desired outcomes.\"\n\nThe FTC declined to comment. Amazon and iRobot did not immediately comment.\n\nAfter the deal collapsed, iRobot in January announced a significant restructuring plan to reduce costs and said it would cut about 31% of its workforce, or 350 jobs. The company also said founder Colin Angle had stepped down as its CEO.\n\nAmazon said in January the deal had no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.\n\nEU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager in January said its in-depth investigation preliminarily showed \"the acquisition of iRobot would have enabled Amazon to foreclose iRobot's rivals by restricting or degrading access to Amazon stores.\"\n\nSeparately, the FTC was poised to reject Amazon's deal before the companies announced they were abandoning it, a source told Reuters in January.\n\nAmazon announced the deal in August 2022. The world's largest online retailer, which already owns Alexa and Ring, was pushing to expand its stable of smart home devices as well as expanding the e-commerce giant's virtual healthcare.

        "title": "AI investments are showing signs of a payoff, but the price is steep",
        "content": "Tech earnings season is in full swing, and while a handful of notable players still need to report, namely Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), there’s one key throughline running through the announcements so far: It’s taking a lot of money to make money on AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), four of tech’s biggest AI players, have each called out AI sales growth, though without many specifics, while pointing to increased spending on capital expenditures to meet AI demand.\n\nMicrosoft announced last week it spent $14 billion on capital expenditures tied to its AI buildout in its fiscal third quarter, up from $7.8 billion in the same period last year. The company’s 2024 capital expenditures have already eclipsed its spending across all of 2023, and there’s still another quarter left in its fiscal year.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet said it spent $12 billion in the last quarter and will continue at that pace for the rest of the year. Meta similarly said it’s cranking up spending for the full year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion. And CFO Susan Li said that number will increase in the year ahead as well.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Amazon said it would blow past last year’s $48.4 billion in capital expenditures, saying the $14 billion it spent in Q1 will be the low for the year.\n\nThose are mountains of cash. And while there are early signs that AI is driving revenue growth, it’ll take time before it truly makes an impact on companies’ bottom lines.\n\n“I'm thinking it's a 12- to 18-month investment period before we start to see a lot of this really pay off big time,” TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\nTesting the AI waters\n\nGenerative AI is still a relatively new technology. Sure, it blew up in 2023, but corporations are slow-moving entities, and many are only starting to try out generative AI applications across their business segments.\n\n“If I sign up for Microsoft 365 with Microsoft, do I sign up all of my 100,000 employees or do I sign up 500 to check it out?” O’Donnell asked, adding that companies are starting out with a smaller number of signups to get a sense of how they can best use AI applications on the job before signing up the rest of their employees.\n\nThat’s not necessarily a bad thing for tech companies. During its earnings call last week, Microsoft said AI accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth in its Azure and other cloud services business. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter and 3 percentage points in the quarter before that. In Q4 last year, the company said AI drove 1 percentage point of growth in Azure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while it might seem like growth is falling off precipitously, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said it was more the result of a lack of available AI capacity. In other words, Microsoft didn’t have the resources needed to meet customer demand.\n\nGoogle CFO Ruth Porat noted a similar increase in AI sales during her company’s earnings call, saying that Google’s Cloud Platform saw increasing revenue contributions from AI, though she didn’t provide an exact number.\n\nFor Amazon’s part, CFO Brian Olsavsky said customers continue to sign up for larger and longer deal commitments for Amazon Web Services, with many adding generative AI components.\n\nSpending won’t slow down anytime soon\n\nIt might take a year or more to start seeing AI-based revenue growth truly take off, but that doesn’t mean companies are going to ease up on spending. According to Forrester analyst Rowan Curran, companies have been pouring money into AI technologies for years; generative AI has just supercharged that spending.\n\n“We saw a huge growth and investment over the past … year and 18 months, but this has been a continuous increase over the past, I would say, eight or 10 years,” he said. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg presents new devices and AI offerings at the Meta Connect developer conference. (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nAnd tech companies are preparing investors for the long road ahead. During Meta’s earnings call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to assuage concerns that the social media giant will need to plow cash into its AI efforts, though it largely fell on deaf ears, as shares tumbled 14% the morning after the announcement.\n\nHood, meanwhile, said that Microsoft will continue to push AI spending, with levels likely to be the same as those in the company’s fiscal 2025 as they’ve been throughout its fiscal 2024.\n\nOlsavsky offered a similar outlook for Amazon, saying that the company will plow money into generative AI services.\n\n“We will be meaningfully stepping up our capex and the majority of that will be … to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts,” he said during the company’s earnings call.\n\nNow companies just have to prove all of that spending is paying off and provide the numbers to match.

        "title": "Shhh! 3 Secret Stocks Flying Below Wall Street’s Radar",
        "content": "There are thousands of stocks for investors to choose from, many of which are undervalued stocks despite consistently outperforming the market. Typically, the same companies get attention from analysts, investors and the business press. Tons of ink is spilled writing about mega-cap tech stocks such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:APPL). At the same time, almost no mention is made of small-capitalized stocks that offer superior returns to investors.\n\nThis is a shame as investors are missing out on stocks of great companies with a consistent track record of outperformance, are attractively valued and pay dividends to their shareholders. Often, these overlooked stocks are smaller companies operating in sectors viewed as uninteresting or dull. But nothing is boring about doubling one’s capital. Shhh! Here are three secret stocks flying below Wall Street’s radar.\n\nMueller Industries (MLI) Stacks of copper tubing\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMueller Industries (NYSE:MLI) is the type of old school, small-cap stock that Wall Street and most investors completely ignore. Founded in 1917 and based in Tennessee, Mueller Industries makes copper, brass, aluminum and plastic products mostly used in plumbing, refrigeration and industrial applications, including water drainage. The company employs about 4,500 people, its current CEO has been in place since 2009, and the stock’s market capitalization is $6.5 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite its relatively small size, Mueller Industries has operations throughout North America, Europe and Asia, from England to China. And the stock has been an absolute winner, gaining 24% this year, rising 59% over the last 12 months, and increasing 285% through five years. Despite the growth, the valuation on MLI stock is attractive, trading at 11 times future earnings estimates and with a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share, good for a yield of 1.38%.\n\nDespite all its success, only one analyst follows Mueller Industries. Until recently, no analysts followed the stock. That’s a shame, especially as the company reported Q1 earnings and the stock rose 7% in a single trading day.\n\nIES Holdings (IESC) An array of electrical conduits are lined up in a row across the ceiling of a room.\n\nSource: Sinn P. Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a super successful stock that no analysts follow. That would be IES Holdings (NASDAQ:IESC). Another small-cap stock based in the south focused on industry, IES Holdings, used to be known as Integrated Electrical Services. Founded in 1997, the company was, at one point, the most significant electrical contractor in the U.S. Due to rapid growth, it ran into financial problems and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006.\n\nStory continues\n\nRebranded, restructured and having sold off a subsidiary, the electrical services firm emerged from bankruptcy, and IESC stock has been on fire ever since. The share price has grown 663% in the last five years, including a 208% increase in the previous 12 months. Already in 2024, the stock is up 74%. The company now employs 8,000 people who provide electrical installation and services to data centers, residential houses and industrial facilities. There’s a high concentration of insider ownership at IES Holdings.\n\nSadly, not one analyst covers the company, and it gets almost no media coverage. Yet investors fortunate enough to invest in IESC stock are rewarded with huge gains.\n\nEagle Materials (EXP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEagle Materials (NYSE:EXP) gets a little more attention than the other names on this list. Currently, eight analysts offer ratings and price targets on EXP stock. Still, most people reading this article have likely never heard of Eagle Materials. As with Mueller Industries and IES Holdings, Eagle Materials is an older company based in the south that is an industrial play. Texas-based Eagle Materials produces building materials such as cement, concrete, gypsum and sand for hydraulic fracturing in the oil industry.\n\nWhile its business might not be exciting, it has proven lucrative for shareholders. EXP stock has nearly tripled in price over the last five years, including a 73% gain in the last 12 months. Since January of this year, the stock is up 30%. The analysts covering the company currently have a “strong buy” rating on the stock and a median price target of 12% above current levels. EXP stock trades at 18 times future earnings estimates and pays a quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share for a yield of 0.39%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It also maintains backups across its server farms in regions including Taiwan and Singapore.\n\nThe move is part of Alibaba’s strategy to ensure better security and control over its data and potentially reduce costs and liability issues associated with multi-company data management.\n\nCompanies including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) have reached out to Vietnam to diversify their supply chain base amid heightening geopolitical tensions between the US and China.\n\nLam Research weighed the supply chain shift to Vietnam, with the Vietnamese government canvassing the former to commit $1 billion to local production efforts.\n\nApple suppliers in Vietnam increased by 40% to 35 in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia tapped Vietnamese tech firms for AI development.\n\nAlibaba stock lost over 11% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "Amazon's Smashing Q1 Financials Show The Power Of A Good And Well Executed Strategy\n\nLike Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL),  Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with stronger than expected revenue being the result of the improvements on the ad business front.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nIn part due to its booming AWS division and its advertising service, Amazon reported revenue grew 12.52% YoY to $143.3 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $142.5 billion. Operating income far outpaced revenue growth as well as it soared more than 200% to $15.3 billion, which is the first sign that Amazon’s cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are benefiting the bottom line as net income skyrocketed 229% YoY to $10.43 billion, with diluted EPS amounting to 98 cents a share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 83 cents.\n\nAmazon’s businesses are thriving, beginning with party seller services that cover commissions that Amazon collects, along with fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew 16% YoY to $34.5 billion.\n\nAWS continues to grow and challenge Google and Microsoft, both the cloud and AI front.\n\nThe AWS division reported a 17% YoY growth to $25 billion, surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $24.5 billion and reflecting Amazon’s strong positioning compared to its AI rivals, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), who secured a leadership position with its early entry and OpenAI acquisition, and Alphabet, with the latter finally catching up to its peers in their efforts to lead the way into the golden age of AI.\n\nAWS’ actions could spell trouble for Alphabet and Microsoft as Jassy revealed significant investments over the next few years to build new infrastructure and data centers. Amazon will be investing $5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia and $5 billion in Mexico to build new infrastructure centers, along with $10 billion in Mississippi to build two data centers that are projected to create at least 1,000 jobs.\n\nAdvertising continues to grow, becoming an increasingly important profit driver.\n\nAdvertising revenue grew 24% to $11.8 billion, outpacing both retail and cloud computing growth, as well as StreetAccount’s estimate of $11.7 billion. This is the first report since Amazon introduced ads in Prime Video, which analysts expect to generate significant revenue over time. Despite being new to the ad business, Amazon has emerged as one of the big players in the online advertising arena. CEO Andy Jassy has made it clear that the e-commerce and cloud titan will continue to focus on its ad efforts, as it plans include more of its sponsored content on its Prime Video platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst quarter results across the board show that online ads have rebounded. Last week, Alphabet also announced its ad business reaccelerated after a tough 2022 and 2023. Google reported total ad sales rose from last year’s comparable quarter, when they amounted to $54.55 billion, to $61.66 billion.\n\nSecond Quarter Outlook\n\nAmazon expects profitability growth to continue in the current quarter but at a more measured pace as it guided for an operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, on the back of revenue in the range between $144 billion to $149 billion, translating to revenue growth in the range between 7% and 11%.\n\nAmazon’s disciplined focus on efficiency is showing results.\n\nCost-cutting across the board, fulfillment operations tweaks and stabilization of cloud spending all partially contributed to the earnings growth as Amazon focused to grow its most profitable services, including advertising, cloud computing, Prime memberships and its third-party marketplace.\n\nAmazon continues to stand out among its Big Tech peers as it is yet to implement a quarterly dividend. In February, Meta announced its first dividend at 50 cents a share. Last week, Alphabet followed the footsteps of Meta as it announced its first ever dividend of 20 cents a share.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Participants\n\nAndrew R. Jassy; President, CEO & Director; Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky; Senior VP & CFO; Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nDave Fildes; Director of IR; Amazon.com, Inc.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak; Research Analyst; Morgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth; MD; JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nJustin Post; MD; BofA Securities, Research Division\n\nRonald Victor Josey; MD and Co-Head of Tech & Communications; Citigroup Inc., Research Division\n\nRoss Adam Sandler; MD of Americas Equity Research & Senior Internet Analyst; Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali; MD & Senior Analyst; Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. \r\nAnd for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nHello, and welcome to our Q1 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. \r\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. \r\nDuring this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. \r\nOur guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. \r\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\n\nThanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making.\r\nStarting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the U.S., we recently welcomed Clinique and 2 Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands.\r\nAnother way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our gen AI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment.\r\nAs our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the U.S. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day.\r\nFaster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience.\r\nOne example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes. As we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact.\r\nAnother prominent example is our efforts to revamp our U.S. inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans.\r\nAdvertising performance remained strong, with ad sales up 24% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads but we're encouraged by the early response.\r\nMoving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start. And given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere.\r\nWe're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure.\r\nAnd with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.\r\nYou heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all 3 layers of the gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, Trainium and Inferentia, is quite high given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives. Larger quantities of our latest generation Trainium2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025.\r\nCompanies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker. Our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity.ai trains models 40% faster than SageMaker. Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under 7 months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker.\r\nThe middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production gen AI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models.\r\nBedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair and Toyota. In the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models in the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's various models, Cohere's new models and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met.\r\nAs increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade gen AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications. Customers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these 2 linchpin services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing.\r\nThe top of the stack are the gen AI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code. It also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones. In the near future, Q will help developers transform their .NET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. \r\nQ also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an add to favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks and test suites. It's quite handy. \r\nOn the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, Internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3 and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories and it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, engage in dialogue with customers about this data. \r\nWe also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe a natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data.\r\nQ is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, British Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slam, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today.\r\nI'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these gen AI services. It's less sexy but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS.\r\nWe expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for gen AI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of the future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way.\r\nWe remain very bullish on AWS. We're at $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And this is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments. Our emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well.\r\nWe just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shops. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content, with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Road House movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content.\r\nOur health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year, with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial beta.\r\nThere's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky\n\nThanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate.\r\nSecond, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided. Excluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range.\r\nThis was driven by strong operational performance across all 3 reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\r\nWe remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers: selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we helped customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year.\r\nShifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability.\r\nLooking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improved profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads.\r\nMoving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud.\r\nAdditionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts. AWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage.\r\nAs we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals and making bigger commitments. It's still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI.\r\nTurning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter. Our Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the U.S. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. \r\nI want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. With that, let's move on to your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\n\nProbably for both Andy and Brian. Historically, Amazon has shifted between periods of heavy investment and then margin expansion back into heavier investment, but you now have a much bigger base of gross profit and overall operating income. As you think about gen AI and capital intensity or grocery or Kuiper or health care, is there anything from an investment perspective that could materially impact profitability going forward in your view?\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky\n\nDoug, yes, we have historically always mentioned that. You have seen like a pendulum shift sometimes between profitability and investment. I think we're at the stage now where we're doing both at the same time continually, so we are more apt to talk about the specific investments that we're making and how that might impact our short-term outlook. So if you look at the progress we've made on operating income and free cash flow over really the last 18 months, a lot of it's driven by improvements in our stores business, lower cost to serve. We've talked about regionalization efforts and how that's moving into inbound areas now.\r\nAdvertising has been growing strong and AWS has been strong. And you saw AWS margins increased 800 basis points sequentially off Q4. A lot of that's driven by cost controls and expanding revenue on the top line and lower cost structure throughout the company. We do see, though, on the CapEx side that we will be meaningfully stepping up our CapEx and the majority of that will be in our -- to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts. So I would expect that, that will increase -- it will increase depreciation, definitely in that segment.\r\nOn the -- well, we're talking about CapEx. Right now, in Q1, we had $14 billion of CapEx. We expect that to be the low quarter for the year. As Andy said earlier, we are seeing strong demand signals from our customers and longer deals and larger commitments, many with generative AI components. So those signals are giving us confidence in our expansion of capital in this area.\r\nAnd as he also mentioned, we've done this for 18 years. We invest capital and resources upfront. We create capacity very carefully for our customers. And then we see the revenue, operating income and free cash flow benefit for years to come after that, with strong returns on invested capital. So a little bit of a long-winded answer to your question. But yes, we have -- the main issue that we'll see in the near term is additional CapEx and we've talked about that.\r\nAnd we continue to see strong CapEx performance in our stores business. Most of that will be related to modest capital or capacity increases, in addition to our same-day fulfillment network and some Amazon Logistics upgrades to the fleet. But for the most part, what you'll see is really going to be on the AWS side.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\n\nYes, I just would add briefly, just to summarize. I understand where the question is coming from, Doug. And I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer. I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses in the stores business along with advertising and AWS. There's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think we also -- we've been pretty consistent about don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side.\r\nYes, I think there are really unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us. And I think what people sometimes forget on the AWS side, it's a $100 billion revenue run rate business, that we're still 85-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it means we have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity, which I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure, since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet.\r\nAnd unlike in the cloud where so much -- there's a lot of work to be done to move from on-premises to the cloud, people do it and they get value out of it, which is why they modernize their infrastructure. But it's work. All of this generative AI set of workloads, which will transform every experience they're going to be built from scratch on the cloud largely. And so it's just tremendous opportunities there along with some of the other areas that we're investing that are really early stage. So I think it's both for us.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\n\nSomewhat related question on CapEx intensity in AWS. So I think the CEO of Anthropic has said that I think the next generation of models cost in the neighborhood of $1 billion to train. This would be like Claude 4, I guess, high end. And then the generation after that might be as much as $10 billion to train. So is this something that you feel like the industry will do on top of AWS? Do you feel like Olympus and some of the stuff you're doing in-house needs to kind of stay at the state-of-the-art, or can others do that? And then how much did all this training have an impact on the acceleration that you saw in 1Q for AWS revenue?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\n\nWell, Ross, I would tell you that we have seen kind of 3, I'll call it, macro trends that I think are contributing to AWS' performance, at least in the last quarter. I think first of all, I think the lion's share of cost optimization is behind us. So I think companies will be smart and have learned a lot over the last number of months in how they run their infrastructure in the cloud. But I think the lion's share of the cost optimization is behind us. And I think people have moved to newer initiatives that I would, at a macro level, describe as modernizing their infrastructure and then trying to drive value at a generative AI.\r\nOn the former, I think we were on this march before the pandemic, where most companies were trying to figure out how to move from on-premises to the cloud because it's more cost-effective and it's faster to innovate and they get real developer productivity. And then when the pandemic hit and people were in survival mode and the uncertain economy, you let people save costs wherever they could, and they got distracted on that. But they're back to pursuing and figuring it out because it's low-hanging fruit for them, and we see very significant growth in that space. \r\nAnd at the same time, we're seeing very significant momentum in people trying to figure out how to run their generative AI on top of AWS. I mentioned we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate that we see in AI already, and it's still relatively early days. And I think that there's -- at a high level, there's a few things that we're seeing that's driving that growth. I think first of all, there are so many companies that are still building their models. And these range from the largest foundational model builders like Anthropic, you mentioned, to every 12 to 18 months or building new models.\r\nAnd those models consume an incredible amount of data with a lot of tokens, and they're significant to actually go train. And a lot of those are being built on top of AWS, and I expect an increasing amount of those to be built on AWS over time because our operational performance and security and as well as our chips, both what we offer from NVIDIA. But if you take Anthropic, as an example, they're training their future models on our custom silicon on Trainium. And so I think we'll have a real opportunity for a lot of those models to run on top of AWS.\r\nI think the thing that people sometimes don't realize is that while we're in the stage that so many companies are spending money training models, once you get those models into production, which not that many companies have, but when you think about how many generative AI applications will be out there over time, most will end up being in production when you see the significant run rates. You spend much more in inference than you do in training because you train only periodically, but you're spinning out predictions and inferences all the time.\r\nAnd so we also see quite a few companies that are building their generative AI applications to do inference on top of AWS. And a lot of it has to do with the services. And the primary example we see there is how many companies, tens of thousands of companies, already are building on top of Amazon Bedrock, which has the largest selection of large language models around and a set of features that make it so much easier to build a high-quality, cost-effective low latency, production-grade generative AI applications.\r\nSo we see both training and inference being really big drivers on top of AWS. And then you layer on top of that the fact that so many companies, their models and these generative AI applications are going to have their most sensitive assets and data. And it's going to matter a lot to them what kind of security they get around those applications. And yes, if you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or 2, not all the providers have the same track record. And we have a meaningful edge on the AWS side so that as companies are now getting into the phase of seriously experimenting and then actually deploying these applications to production, people want to run their generative AI on top of AWS.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\n\nI have 2. The first one is on cost to serve. I appreciate all the color in the shareholder letter and even tonight on cost to serve. Andy, maybe could you just help us quantify a little more how to think about some of your North Star cost to serve goals over the next couple of years? And what could that mean for potential accompanying reasonable ranges of outcomes for North America retail margins through all of that?\r\nAnd then the second one, if cost to serve does improve, I think it should lead to significant incremental cash flow even with more CapEx. So just remind us again how you sort of think through the philosophy of returning capital to shareholders in addition to continuing to invest for the long run?\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky\n\nBrian, this is Brian. I will start with your second question. So as far as dividends or buybacks or any other capital structure moves, we don't have anything to share with you on that today. But I'll reacquaint you with our general philosophy. So our first priority is to invest in -- to support the growth opportunities and long-term investments within our businesses. And generally, we still have many opportunities to put that capital to use that would generate meaningful returns, especially as you heard in generative AI.\r\nSo we're very -- we have a great deal of passion on that and conviction on that as well. We are reaching a different stage of free cash flow. As you mentioned, we had negative free cash flow for 2 years, '21 and '22, immediately after the pandemic as we had doubled the size of our operations network and had a lot of other expenses. That was followed by 2023 when we had our largest -- our highest free cash flow ever. And those trends have carried into Q1. So we feel good about the free cash flow. We are, again, still anticipating higher CapEx this year.\r\nThe other thing that we're doing with cash flow right now is we're repaying some of the debt that we had taken on during that negative free cash flow period. We have reached a high watermark at the end of Q1 last year. And since then and then through this year, we'll pay that down over $25 billion. So that's our first priority as well as 2024 capital expenditures. But otherwise, nothing to share on that front.\r\nI'll tee up, Andy, on the stores profitability because I know there's always generally the comment about how high can operating margins go and how do they compare to historic trends. And I think the same still holds. We look back to before the pandemic, and we say, first, we can achieve those operating margins even without the impact of advertising. And we're not quite there yet. But we're not limiting ourselves to that. We're looking for ways to, again, turn over every rock, look at every process and everything that we do on the logistics side and see how can we get our cost structure down and how can we get speed up and selection up. So it is working on a lot of fronts there, but cost is certainly front and center as we meet and improve customer experience.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\n\nAndy, on logistics, in September, you launched Amazon supply chain. Can you just help us understand the opportunity you see there? Where are you in that journey to build logistics as a service on a global basis? And does that require a step function increase in CapEx?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\n\nYes. Thanks for the question, Youssef. I think that it's interesting what's happening with our -- the business we're building in third-party logistics. And it really kind of, in some ways, mirrors some of the other businesses we've gotten involved in, AWS being an example of it, even though it's -- they're very different businesses in that we realized that we had our own internal need to build a bunch of these capabilities.\r\nAnd we figured that there were probably others who had those same needs and we decided to build services out of them. So as our business has grown, it turns out to be pretty hard work to actually import items from overseas, get them through customs and through the border and then ship them from that point to various facilities. And then it turns out that you don't want to store those facilities in fulfillment centers because that space is really scarce. So you'd like to have them in upstream storage facilities that are very inexpensive. And then you'd like to have a way to be able to know when your more scarce supply in the fulfillment centers needs replenishment and be able to do it automatically from those upstream storage facilities.\r\nAnd so all of those were capabilities that we had to build for ourselves to be able to operate our stores business in the way that we wanted to and that our sellers wanted to. And so we built that capability for ourselves first and then we opened up those services as individual services to our sellers. And so we help sellers, we have a service that allows them to get items through the border and through customs. We have a service that allows them to ship from customs to various facilities, whether they're our own or their separate ones.\r\nWe allow them to store items in our upstream low-cost warehouses that they can either automatically replenish into our fulfillment centers where we ship or they can move to other facilities that they have. We have a service that lets them -- where we'll ship either to our end customers if they're selling on Amazon or to their end customers. We obviously have Buy with Prime, where we enable our Prime customers to be able to buy from our third-party Buy with Prime sellers websites, which increases their conversion 25% versus what they would do on their own, and it's a great benefit for our Prime customers.\r\nAnd then I would say that supply chain with Amazon is really an abstraction on top of those individual building block services I just mentioned that makes it easier for customers to have the whole end-to-end supply chain integrated. That collective set of businesses is growing very significantly. It's already what I would consider a reasonable sized business. And I think it's just really early days. It is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us.\r\nWe have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business, and we think we can -- it will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third-party sellers. But are third-party sellers find high value in us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves and they save money in the process.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\n\nI thought I'd ask a couple of growth drivers that you mentioned. First, grocery, it seems like you're still changing the threshold for free delivery or the subscription prices. Just can you say at all how much that's contributing to your gross right now and do you think you're over the hump? Or are you optimistic this can be a really big category for you? And then maybe a little bit extra on Prime Video ramp, how that ramp went versus your expectations? And do you think that could be a meaningful contributor to ad revenues going forward?\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\n\nYes. I'll take them in opposite order just on Prime Video ads. Very early days, just launched a few months ago. It's off to a really good start. I think advertisers are excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us in video beyond Twitch and Freevee to Prime Video shows and movies. I think they also find that the relevancy and the measurability of that type of advertising and Prime Video ads is unique for them. So it's off to a very good start, it's early days, but we're optimistic there.\r\nOn grocery, I would tell you that we continue to be optimistic about what we're doing in grocery. We have a very large grocery business. It's kind of got a few different components. And we have a very, very significant nonperishables grocery business much the same way that the mass merchandisers entered this business 30 or 40 years ago. These are consumables and canned goods and pet food and health care and beauty products. That continues to grow at a very rapid rate.\r\nAnd we have an organic grocery business in Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in that space. And that business continues to grow very nicely. We're introducing a new smaller format in the fall in Manhattan and the Whole Foods Market Daily Shops idea. We've worked very hard on the profitability trajectory over the last 18 months and like the way that, that has taken shape. And then if you want to have -- do you want to serve as many grocery missions as we aim to serve. You have to have a perishables business and a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh.\r\nWe've launched our V2 format in physical stores over the last few months, primarily in Chicago and Southern California. We like the early results a lot. They're really meaningfully better in almost every dimension. It's still early, and there's some things to work through, but we like what we're seeing there. And then we have to decide the best way to roll those out over time.\r\nAnd as you mentioned, Justin, we just launched a Prime benefit for grocery, which is all-you-can-eat delivery for $9.99 a month, which if you order once from Whole Foods a month, it pays for itself, or once from Amazon Fresh for orders under $40, it pays for itself. It's a very valuable offering for our Prime members, and it's off to a great start. So we have a lot -- in my opinion, we have lots of ways that we can continue to help customers satisfy their grocery needs. And we have some building blocks that I think might also change how people split up their grocery orders over time. But I continue to be optimistic that, that's going to continue to grow for us.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nMaybe, Andy, I wanted to ask on international profitability, just after 1Q's 2.8% margin. Talk just about where we are in terms of international getting or to consistent profitability. We're following a similar trajectory as North America in terms of benefiting from regionalization shift, and we saw what average distance of each package traveled actually came down by 25 kilometers and whatnot. And if you could provide any insights on maybe how inbound fulfillment architecture might add to just continued benefits on faster shipping, same-day, next day, et cetera.\n\nBrian T. Olsavsky\n\nThank you, Ron. I'm going to start with this one on international profitability. So yes, in the quarter, our operating income was $902 million. And if you've watched that, we've seen a steady progression in operating income in our international segment, it's up $2.2 billion year-over-year. So we like the trend there. It breaks down into a few areas. I would say the established countries of Europe, Japan, as well as the U.K. are following a lot of the same trajectory as in the United States. They are profitable in their own right. They are adding selection, they're adding new features like grocery there, adding to their Prime benefits, and a lot of the work that we do in the United States carries over there. \r\nThe second group is the emerging countries. And of course, we've launched 10 new countries in the last 7 years. Each of those has its own particular trajectory on profitability. The first thing we see there is having a good customer experience, having people sign up for Prime. A lot of times, our Prime Video benefits help with that. Then work on our cost structure as we get scale, add advertising and other things. And eventually, what we see is a breakeven -- countries breakeven and then they make positive income and free cash flow and are more of a contribution to the -- positive contribution to the international segment. So we're seeing both the emerging and the established improving, and we like the trajectory. And I think you'll see more of as we move forward.\n\nAndrew R. Jassy\n\nYes. I would add a few things. I mean, I'm again quite bullish on our international stores business. It's already a very large business. We've added a number of countries that are on the right trajectory, as Brian just indicated, and it's going to be a big, profitable business for us. And I really like the direction it's headed.\r\nI'll take also just the second part of your question just really around continuing to take -- to work on cost structure. I'd say, first of all, on the regionalization side, which we've talked a lot about the last year, it may sound a little boring to talk about because we talked about it a lot of times. But I'd just tell you that we're not done there. A lot of the work that we've done, we still have opportunities to refine, to get more value out of that. And a lot of what we learned on the regionalization side in the U.S. was in part inspired from what we saw in Europe, which, in many ways, is set up as a regional network because of the nature of how close those countries are to one another.\r\nAnd I would say we have also learned lessons from what we've done in the U.S. that we're going to be able to apply to our international operations as well. I think we see additional opportunities in all sorts of places. A good example of which is just how and where we inbound items to. The architecture we've had set up has largely had people inbounding to a couple of places. And then we took -- we spent a lot of effort and time and expense in breaking those down and shipping them to lots of other places.\r\nAnd we believe we're going to be much more efficient in how we use the inbound network and how we partner with our sellers. Part of what we did with our change in seller fees, we lowered the outbound fees in a meaningful way, but then we added an incentive for our sellers to inbound into locations that allow us to be more cost following and allow both our sellers and us to enjoy in those cost savings when we're able to do so. And we're seeing very optimistic signs there, too.\r\nI think we're still early with respect to how we can continue to optimize the number of units per box, which has all sorts of good benefits. And then I'd just also say that it's been really interesting to watch the same-day facilities evolution in our fulfillment network. And I think a lot of people have made the assumption over the last few years that faster speeds are going to mean higher cost, and that is not the case if you build the infrastructure with the right building blocks the way we have over the last couple of years.\r\nAnd our same-day facilities are our least expensive facilities in the network. We still have a fraction of the number of those that we will have in the U.S. that we'll have in other parts of the world, which will, again, both change our cost structure while increasing speed. So I don't think we're at the limits of what we can do. It's not going to all happen in 1 year. We're going to be working hard at this and inventing at this for several years, but I think we have a lot of upside in front of us.\n\nDave Fildes\n\nThank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Posts Biggest Cloud Sales Growth in Year on AI Demand",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, a sign that the retailer’s most profitable unit is recovering from a slump as businesses resume spending on technology projects, including artificial intelligence services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Axes Most of Supercharger Team in Blow to Other Automakers Traders Expect Biggest Fed-Day Move in S&P Since 2023, Citi Says Wall Street Hit by Fed Jitters to Close Wild April: Markets Wrap Pot Stocks Surge on Report DEA Set to Reclassify Marijuana HSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years\n\nDespite the strong cloud performance, the company’s sales forecast for the current quarter fell short of estimates, reflecting concern about the main e-commerce business as consumers continue to spend cautiously.\n\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy in recent years has cut costs and focused on profitability in Amazon’s online shopping business, laying off thousands of people and touting a more efficient warehouse network. At the same time, he’s backed big investments in artificial intelligence services that Amazon expects to generate tens of billions in revenue in the coming years. Those sales are starting to materialize.\n\nThe Seattle-based company posted first-quarter operating profit of $15.3 billion. Revenue increased 13% to $143.3 billion in the period ended March 31, Amazon said Tuesday in a statement. Both figures topped analysts’ estimates.\n\nSales in the Amazon Web Services cloud unit were $25 billion, up 17% from a year earlier. Analysts estimated AWS sales of $24.1 billion.\n\n“We’re seeing strong demand signals from our customers on the AWS side,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. “They’re signing longer deals with larger commitments, many with generative AI components.” Olsavsky said generative artificial intelligence now represented a “multi-billion dollar revenue run rate business” for Amazon, the first time the company has publicly put even an approximate figure on that franchise.\n\nThat will come at a cost. The AI chatbots, data-crunching tools, and other software that respond to queries from users are possible only thanks to massive quantities of cutting-edge computer chips. Olsavsky said Amazon’s capital expenditures would “meaningfully increase” in 2024, primarily to support AWS growth, including for generative AI. The company has said it will spend more than $150 billion to build out and operate data centers in the coming years.\n\nSales growth at the cloud unit had slowed to a record low last year as businesses cut back on technology spending and sought to curb computing bills that ballooned during the pandemic. Investors have been banking on a rebound this year, particularly after strong results last week from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon’s two main rivals in the business of renting computing power and data storage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS generated a profit of $9.42 billion in the quarter. The unit’s operating margin — 37.6% — is the widest since Amazon began disclosing sales for its cloud business. The division held its largest-ever layoffs last year, and has continued to trim its ranks selectively, even as it hires in other areas.\n\nAmazon said revenue will be $144 billion to $149 billion in the period ending in June. Analysts, on average, projected $150.2 billion.\n\nThe company’s main e-commerce business reported sales of $54.6 billion in the quarter, slightly missing analysts’ estimates. Olsavsky said consumers continue to trade down to save money. Shoppers are ordering more consumables, which they need quickly, but also cost less than other categories, he said. That puts pressure on the profitability of the business because Amazon has to process and deliver more units.\n\nThe slowing e-commerce sales also have pushed Amazon to seek greater growth for other business lines. For example, advertising revenue rose 24% to $11.8 billion. The results reflect the first quarter since Amazon introduced video advertising to the Prime Video streaming service.\n\nAmazon shares gained about 2% in extended trading after closing at $175 in New York. The stock has jumped about 15% in 2024.\n\n(Updates with comments from CFO in the sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India’s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes How the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat Hacker Found Guilty of Leaking Finnish Therapy Records Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "New survey data shows investing in procurement is a top priority for small businesses and that many small businesses are exploring how best to adopt artificial intelligence technologies in 2024\n\nAmazon Business launches Small Business Success Studio,an on-demand collection of immersive educational resources to help small businesses grow\n\nEligible small businesses can apply by May 24 for the company's Small Business Grants program, which provides the chance to win monetary grants and other prizes\n\nSEATTLE, May 01, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Business (NASDAQ: AMZN), the company’s business-to-business procurement store, today kicked off its third annual Small Business Month to help support the growth of small businesses in the U.S. This year, Small Business Month includes an exciting and interactive new online resource center called Small Business Success Studio [https://business.amazon.com/studio]. The studio provides small businesses with free online educational tools and resources to start, run, and grow their business. As part of Small Business Month, Amazon Business also launched the 2024 Small Business Grants program that gives eligible small businesses in the U.S. the chance to win over $250,000 in monetary grants.\n\nAccording to a recent survey of small-business decision-makers across the United States, the ​​top three challenges small-business decision-makers say are keeping them up at night are high inflation (50%), high operations/labor costs (42%), and supply chain distribution (41%). While contending with these macroeconomic challenges, small business owners remain optimistic, with 93% feeling hopeful about the state of the economy.\n\nSmall businesses are also looking for new ways to grow their business. They see increasing their procurement budget (65%) and investing in procurement (75%), especially procurement tools (49%), are ways to do so. While these play a key role in scaling their business, more than two-thirds (68%) of business owners surveyed feel that there is room for optimization in their procurement operations and half are worried that if they don't adopt artificial intelligence technologies in 2024, their business will fall behind.\n\n\"Driving education and getting funds to small businesses who are driving impact in their local communities is something we’re very passionate about at Amazon Business,\" said Shelley Salomon, vice president of Amazon Business Worldwide. \"Setting these small businesses up for success, whether through grants, educational opportunities, or the innovative tools Amazon Business offers to simplify buying decisions, our hope is to help free up some time and resources so they can focus on their mission.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSmall Business Success Studio\n\nLaunched today, the Small Business Success Studio is a new on-demand, immersive online educational resource for all entrepreneurs eager to start, grow, and/or scale their businesses—provided by Amazon Business at no cost. Packing essential know-how across finance, marketing, procurement, and operations into easy-to-digest content, the Studio features real success stories and practical tips from seasoned founders like Allison Ellsworth of poppi. Users gain access to peer insights and learn how to use Amazon Business to simplify the procurement experience and gain operational efficiencies, saving both time and money. Aimed at being a strategic partner for growth, the Studio supports small business owners at every step of their journey, fueling inspiration, education, and community.\n\nSmall Business Grants Program\n\nTo further support the growth of small businesses, Amazon Business launched the 2024 Small Business Grants program, designed to spur innovation and support the growth of small businesses that are driving impact in their local communities. This year, Amazon Business is giving eligible small businesses in the U.S. the chance to win over $250,000 in grants, with one grand prize winner, 4 finalists, and 10 semi-finalists. Existing Amazon Business customers with an annual revenue of $1 million or less can apply for the grant. Grant recipients will receive one year of free Business Prime membership, Amazon Devices, and Amazon Basics products. Applications are due by May 24, 2024 and winners will be announced on July 22, 2024. For additional information and to apply, visit www.amazon.com/smallbusinessgrant.\n\nGiftAMeal, based in St. Louis, Missouri, was the 2023 grand prize winner, receiving $25,000 to invest into its business. The business donates a meal to a family in need each time a guest takes a photo of their order from a partner restaurant. Each month, over 40,000 meals are provided through 70 local food banks in 35 states. GiftAMeal used the 2023 grant to fuel their nationwide expansion, empowering them to reach new communities and make a greater impact.\n\n\"We could not be more appreciative for this recognition,\" said Andrew Glantz, founder and CEO of GiftAMeal. \"The Amazon Business grant allowed us to continue to serve underrepresented communities and provide meals to people who need it the most.\"\n\nAmazon Business is dedicated to equipping its 6 million and growing business customers, ranging from sole proprietors to multinational enterprises, with smart business buying tools that can help reshape organizational processes, fortify procurement efforts, and ultimately, ensure procurement is better prepared for the unpredictable.

To learn about the 2023 grant winners and how they used their awards, visit the 2023 recipients page.\n\nSurvey methodology\n\n450-500 small-business decision-makers in the U.S. were asked about their online purchasing patterns, the challenges and opportunities impacting purchasing processes, and the broader landscape for small businesses. All respondents are 18 years or older, work at a business making $25 million or less in annual revenue, and with 20-100 employees. The survey was executed by Morning Consult, between March 20 – April 12, 2024.\n\nAbout Amazon Business\n\nAmazon Business helps millions of customers worldwide—from small businesses, schools, hospitals, nonprofits, and government agencies to large enterprises with global operations — reshape their procurement with cost and time savings, greater productivity, and insightful purchasing analytics.

        "title": "Google AI Predicts These 3 Stocks Can Make You Rich by 2026",
        "content": "Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Gemini AI has once again been overtaken by other models, but it remains one of the best choices out there for AI stock predictions. Bard (the company’s model preceding Gemini) was previously ranked by analysts as the best AI tool for stock picking, even outperforming human stock pickers a test run. However, Gemini has become far more conservative over the months. It is a challenge to elicit any kind of stock recommendations now. Thankfully, you can still coax out some picks if you twiddle around for long enough.\n\nThere is still value in examining such AI stock predictions. These predictions provide perspective and predictive capability beyond what most human analysts can match. You still should approach Gemini’s recommendations as an additional data point rather than a definitive forecast. That said, here are three stocks that Gemini seems bullish on right now.\n\nWhirlpool (WHR) The Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate building. Whirlpool layoffs.\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nGemini: “As a leading appliance manufacturer, Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) has a solid market position and a history of profitability. The stock has been trading at a relatively low valuation, potentially offering an opportunity for value investors.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI agree with Gemini and think that the market may have gone too far with Whirlpool’s selloff. Currently, WHR stock is down nearly 62% from its highs and is going back towards its COVID trough. These levels are very enticing. The stock definitely looks risky if you are looking at the short term, but buying WHR stock now will likely yield significant returns if you hold for many years.\n\nYou should keep in mind that Whirlpool is quite a cyclical business. Interest rates have a big impact on the company. That’s mostly why the company’s stock has been plunging even after it beat earnings and revenue estimates in Q1. Whirlpool reported earnings per share of $1.78. This was above the analyst estimates of $1.61. Additionally, the company reported revenue of $4.49 billion, which was 1.58% better than the analyst estimate for revenue of $4.4 billion.\n\nMoving forward, I expect that the stock will likely bottom out soon and climb higher. We are looking at bargain-basement valuations and rate cuts on the horizon. Once rate cuts take effect, we could see this stock soar again.\n\nShopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nGemini: “This e-commerce platform empowers businesses of all sizes to create online stores and manage their sales. With the continued growth of e-commerce, Shopify’s (NYSE:SHOP) platform is well-positioned for further expansion.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGemini’s explanation about why Shopify is well-positioned for growth is quite oversimplified, but is still true. E-commerce is the future and will continue to grow fast. There are lots of competitors in this space, but Shopify has significant advantages in how it operates.\n\nFirst, what makes Shopify unique is that it is an e-commerce platform. That means that businesses can have their own standalone store using the platform. It is not to be confused with a marketplace like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe stock has recovered 178% from its trough back in 2022, but I still see upside. I wouldn’t say the potential upside here would necessarily make you “rich” in two years as the title of this article says, but it can still beat the broader market’s returns.\n\nShopify’s earnings per share are expected to grow from $1 in 2024 to $5.60 in 2032, with revenue growing from $8.6 billion to $33.7 billion over that timeframe. Paying 71-times earnings and 11-times sales for that growth is certainly expensive, but it still leaves room for upside in the coming years.\n\nCloudflare (NET) The logo of Cloudflare, (NET) an US web infrastructure & security company, its website on iOS.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nGemini: “This company provides content delivery network services, cybersecurity solutions, and other cloud-based tools. With the increasing reliance on internet infrastructure and rising cybersecurity threats, Cloudflare has strong growth potential.”\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) is a company I’ve written about many times back in 2022 and it has appreciated substantially since then. Back then, the stock was seen as very expensive, and rightfully so. In fact, it currently trades around 154-times forward earnings and 18.4-times forward sales. This is much more expensive than it was back then, and I believe it can go even higher from here.\n\nI am a strong believer in fundamentals, but sometimes it pays to be flexible. Cloudflare has an unusual monopoly in the cybersecurity sector, especially when it comes to small and medium businesses. You may have likely come across a Cloudflare captcha or seen a few Cloudflare messages while browsing. This company makes it very cheap and easy for websites to protect themselves and improve their SEO metrics at the same time all under one platform. The company even offers a VPN, a DNS, and a captcha system that many websites are opting to use instead of Google’s captcha service.\n\nI believe Cloudflare’s dominance deserves the premium, as 80% of websites use it. We’re also looking at very strong growth over the coming years. The company’s earnings are expected to grow 17x from 2024 to 2033.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The outlook for growth stocks was much stronger at the beginning of 2024. Back then, markets were expecting rate cuts from the Federal Reserve as early as March. Some pundits were expecting  as many as four or five rate cuts in 2024.\n\nFast forward to late April and it remains to be seen whether there will be any rate cuts at all this year. Inflation is proving to be very sticky. The economy continues to be strong overall. It all suggests that the Federal Reserve can take its time before enacting any such cuts.\n\nThat truth continues to cause difficulty for growth stocks that thrive in low interest environments. However, growth stock valuations remain at low creating an opportunity for investors to buy shares that have been ignored by the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) stock fell off a cliff in late February when it was announced that CEO Frank Slootman would step down. The announcement coincided with a drop in share price from $230 to roughly $150 a few weeks later.\n\nThe irony of the debacle is that many analysts are on record stating that the move did nothing to change their material opinion of the company. That alone should be reason enough for investors to establish a position: Given the fall off in price there’s an obvious rebound opportunity.\n\nTop line results continue to grow in excess of 30%. Snowflake continues to be among the more unheralded cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities available to investors. Meanwhile, the company just launched a dedicated, enterprise-scale large language model (LLM). It’s clear that snowflake intends to differentiate itself in that regard. While other competitors continue to dedicate resources toward consumer facing AI products, Snowflake is aiming at the enterprise opportunity.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a sort of middle of the road chip design firm that doesn’t get that much attention. Yet, the stock is deserving of investor focus especially in light of a few current factors.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is that its shares are valued at $640 while it currently trades for $530. Part of the reason for that upside is the fact that synopsis continues to grow rapidly. During the most recent quarter, sales increased by 21%. That resulted in earnings which exceeded the high end of guidance.\n\nMy guess is that the market remains hesitant because it wants further clarity regarding the proposed acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). It’s an interesting buy because Ansys Provides Software that predicts how  likely products  are to work in the real world. Meanwhile, Synopsys provides semiconductor design software. It’s easy to see why there’s optimism around the acquisition: Synopsys  is positioned to become a better, more accurate provider of chip designs more suited to real-world scenarios.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has fallen over the past few weeks presenting an opportunity in a company that is rarely ignored for long.\n\nI’d argue that Amazon is among the best positioned of the tech giants at this point. The company has been something of a laggard in relation to artificial intelligence. However, Amazon is also investing $150 billion in a data center build out over the coming 15 years. The company is clearly very serious about the opportunity.\n\nIt also invested billions more in Anthropic, bringing its total investment to $4 billion as promised. That investment will provide Amazon with potentially invaluable machine learning resources that could help it build powerful in-house chips for the future. Amazon, like all the other Big Tech firms, is intent on building its own AI chips for the future. It’s far too early to assign any likelihood of success to each of those firms. That said, investors have to like what Amazon has done in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nStocks tumbled into the close on Tuesday, a fitting end to the year's most challenging month for investors.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 4% while the Dow (^DJI) lost 4.5%, marking its worst month since September 2022.\n\nAnd much of this reversal was driven by the winners who got us here in the first place.\n\nThe three US stocks with the biggest market cap gains in the first three months of the year — Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) — suffered the biggest losses to their market caps in April.\n\nNvidia was up a cool $1 trillion in market cap as of the final trading day of March, of which it gave up over $85 billion in April — the third-biggest such loss in the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft, the first quarter's silver medalist, added over $330 billion. But it subsequently lost over $210 billion in April.\n\nThen there's Meta Platforms, which turned in a similar performance to Microsoft, gaining nearly $330 billion through March before losing just over $140 billionin April.\n\nApril had its share of winners, too, with these names also marking a reversal from what predominated in the year's first quarter.\n\nTesla (TSLA) gained over $25 billion in April, putting it in second place for the month after coming in next-to-last in the first quarter with a loss of $230 billion.\n\nApple (AAPL) was sitting dead last among US stocks at the end of March with a year-to-date market cap loss of nearly $350 billion. After the close on Monday, it had gained over $30 billion in value over April, but a day later — at month-end — that gain had dwindled to $2 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) took first prize, gaining nearly $150 billion in the month. All of this and more came the day after it reported first quarter earnings last week, logging a 10% gain, which was good for $197 billion of market cap.\n\nThese big names also demonstrate how moves across sectors showed similar trends of reversion, with gains and losses swapping places.\n\nInformation Technology (XLK) — the home of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple — was the No. 1 large-cap gainer in market cap through March, rising $1.5 trillion. It was also the biggest loser in April, falling over $650 billion.\n\nCommunications Services (XLC) — home of Alphabet and Meta — was third in first quarter gains, adding $570 billion in market cap. It fell to the middle of the pack when it comes to April losses, losing nearly $100 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY) — home of Amazon and Tesla — was dead last among sectors in the first three months of the year, only to drop $180 billion in April.\n\nNotable April losses also include Financials (XLF), down $275 billion, and Health Care (XLV), which lost over $280 billion.\n\nThe only sector to gain in April was Utilities (XLU), which has also been the biggest laggard of this bull market that began in October of 2022.\n\nApril's plot twists still appear to be corrections, rather than shifts, in the narrative. Meta, for instance, may have lost well over $140 billion in value over the month of April, but shareholders are still sitting on annual gains of over 20%.\n\nTuesday's rocky close comes right as the proverbial \"sell in May and go away\" headlines are set to trigger. Astute investors understand that market seasonality is a nuanced phenomenon. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Aston Martin sales are worse than expected (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter, driven by growth in advertising and cloud computing.\n\nThe earnings sent shares of the retail giant up as much as 5% in pre-market trading.\n\nAmazon posted profits of $10.4bn (£8.3bn) in the first three months of 2024, up from $3.2bn during the same period last year.\n\nFirst-quarter sales increased 13% to $143.3bn, driven by strong retail sales in North America and rapid growth across Amazon Web Services (AWS), its digital infrastructure division. Net income more than tripled to $10.4bn in the first quarter.\n\nSales at AWS accelerated 17% in the first quarter to $25bn, topping Wall Street’s forecast for sales growth of 12% to $24.5bn.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCEO Andy Jassy told analysts that for Amazon \"there is a big opportunity in front of us\" in servicing AI customers.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London stocks rise despite UK house prices falling in April\n\nThe company expects revenue of $144bn to $149bn for the current quarter ending June.\n\nMamta Valechha, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"The stock price reaction after hours was broadly flat. Amazon is a much-loved name with expectations increasing into results given strong performances from other cloud names such as Microsoft and Google. But nevertheless, we have a company producing record profits and using these profits to fund the next leg of growth.\"\n\nAMD (AMD)\n\nAMD reported first-quarter sales on Tuesday that were slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, and provided an in-line forecast for the current quarter.\n\nHowever, lighter-than-anticipated guidance for the current quarter sent the stock lower.\n\nShares in the chipmaker were down about 6% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.\n\nAMD said it expects about $5.7bn in sales in the current quarter, in line with Wall Street estimates of the same approximate total. That would represent about 6% annual growth.\n\nThe chipmaker reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.62 on revenue of $5.5bn. Wall Street was looking for adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $5.45bn.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income came in at $123m, or 7 cents per share, versus a net loss of $139m, or 9 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Revenue was up about 2% from a year earlier.\n\nThe company projected that its MI300 lineup – a family of so-called AI accelerators – will generate about $4bn in revenue this year. Though that’s up from an earlier prediction of $3.5bn, some investors were hoping for as much as $8bn, according to analysts.\n\nGSK (GSK.L)\n\nGSK has increased its annual profit forecast amid strong demand for its shingles and common respiratory virus vaccines.\n\nThe company now expects core profits, its preferred measure, to grow by 9% to 11%, compared with 7% to 10% in previous guidance, while sales for the current financial year are set to grow at the top end of a previously guided range of 5% to 7%.\n\nIt also attributed its increased forecast to a successful royalty dispute appeal for ovarian cancer drug Zejula in the first quarter.\n\nThe firm's total sales for the quarter came in at £7.4bn, up 10% from the same point a year ago. Total operating profit fell 18% to £1.49bn during the period.\n\nRead more: Who is the breadwinner in your family and does it matter for your finances?\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said strong growth in vaccine and speciality medicines drove the double digit rise in first-quarter sales and a second upgrade of the year.\n\n\"Prudent cost management has allowed underlying earnings to rise at a faster rate. But the one cost line GSK has been investing in is R&D. That’s pleasing to see given the clinical success emerging from the pipeline,\" he said.\n\nAston Martin (AML.L)\n\nAston Martin revealed sales dropped by more than a quarter at the start of the year.\n\nRevenues at the luxury car maker dropped by 10% to £267.7m in the first three months of the year as it sold fewer vehicles, down 26% to 945.\n\nAnalysts had forecast revenues of £290.4m and sales of 1,159 units. Operating losses worsened by 15% to £58.7m.\n\nAston Martin, which has launched several new cars over the past year including its next generation sports cars the DB12 and Vantage, stopped production of old models ahead of the ramp up in production of fresh models later this year.\n\n\"Our first-quarter performance reflects this expected period of transition,\" chairman Lawrence Stroll said in a statement.\n\nShares fell as much as 14% in early trading to 128 pence, their lowest level since November 2022, but has since recovered slightly.\n\nWatch: Amazon reports jump in Q1 sales, beats expectations\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android",

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in May (and Beyond)",
        "content": "Since taking the reins at Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, all CEO Warren Buffett has done is crush the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column. Whereas the S&P 500 has gained north of 33,000%, including dividends paid, since Buffett became CEO, Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) have risen by more than 4,900,000%.\n\nAlthough the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as Buffett has come to be known, is just as fallible as any other investor, he's demonstrated an uncanny ability to find value hiding in plain sight. It's why so many investors pay close attention to Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio and the 45 stocks and two index funds contained within. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAs we march ahead into May, three of these Warren Buffett stocks stand out for all the right reasons and are screaming buys right now (and for the long run).\n\nVisa\n\nThe first magnificent Buffett stock that can make patient investors substantially richer is none other than payment processor Visa(NYSE: V). Despite being a stone's throw from a new all-time high, Visa has the tools and competitive advantages necessary to continually outperform Wall Street's benchmark stock indexes.\n\nIf you're looking for a chink in Visa's armor, the company being cyclical is about it. When downturns occur in the U.S. and global economy, it's perfectly normal for consumers and businesses to spend less. If less payment volume and fewer transactions occur on Visa's network, there's a good likelihood that its sales and profit growth will slow or shift into reverse. At the moment, the historic decline we're witnessing in U.S. M2 money supply is worrisome for the U.S. economy.\n\nHowever, the flipside to the above concern is that every recession since the end of World War II has been short-lived. Only three of the one dozen downturns in the U.S. economy reached 12 months in duration, with none surpassing 18 months. Long periods of growth allow Visa to take advantage of higher consumer and enterprise spending.\n\nTo add to the above, Visa is purely a payment facilitator and has steered clear of lending. During recessions, lending institutions often have to set aside capital to cover potential credit delinquencies and loan losses. While Visa isn't double dipping like some of its peers and collecting interest income, its advantage is that it doesn't have to set aside money for loan losses. In short, it bounces back from recessions faster than just about any financial stock.\n\nWhat makes Visa such a phenomenal business is its domestic and international opportunity. In the U.S., Visa is the unquestioned market share leader, as well as the only payment processor to meaningfully gain share following the Great Recession.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, most emerging markets are still largely underbanked. Visa has demonstrated a willingness to buy its way into higher growth regions, as it did when it acquired Visa Europe in 2016. It can also organically push into underbanked markets, which can further fuel its double-digit cross-border volume growth.\n\nVisa's current forward price-to-earnings ratio is below 25, which marks a 15% discount to its forward-earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nA second Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought in May is consumer staples colossus Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola happens to be the stock Berkshire Hathaway has continuously held the longest (since 1988).\n\nArguably the biggest worry for current and prospective Coca-Cola shareholders is the prevailing rate of domestic and global inflation. If labor and/or input costs for its products are rapidly rising, it has the potential to chip away at the company's operating margin.\n\nOn the other hand, Coca-Cola has exceptional branding and phenomenal pricing power. Because it sells a basic necessity good (beverages) that people are going to buy in any economic climate, it can count on predictable operating cash flow and rarely has any trouble passing along higher prices to consumers to offset inflation.\n\nOne of Coca-Cola's biggest competitive edges is its geographic diversity. With the exception of three countries (North Korea, Cuba, and Russia), it has operations ongoing everywhere else. It also has more than two-dozen brands generating in excess of $1 billion in annual sales. Wall Street loves certainty, and Coke's presence in developed markets generates predictable and transparent cash flow. Meanwhile, its presence in emerging markets offers decades'-worth of potential needle-moving organic growth.\n\nAdditionally, Coca-Cola's marketing prowess is virtually unmatched among consumer goods companies. While Procter & Gamble spends nothing short of a small fortune each year on advertising, Coca-Cola has been the most-chosen brand from retail shelves for a decade running (as of 2022), per Kantar's \"Brand Footprint\" report. Coca-Cola hasn't been shy about leaning on digital ad channels and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor ads to reach younger audiences.\n\nBest of all, Coca-Cola is historically cheap. Shares are currently trading for a shade north of 20 times consensus earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, which is 12% below the average forward-earnings multiple Coke stock has been valued at over the last five years. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock that stands out as a screaming buy in May (and well beyond) is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Note, I'm writing this up prior to Amazon reporting its first-quarter operating results on Tuesday, April 30.\n\nWhat current and prospective Amazon shareholders tend to worry about most is the potential for a U.S. recession. Since Amazon generates a substantial chunk of revenue from its online marketplace, there's the belief that a U.S. recession could heavily weigh on its bottom line -- but this couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nThough most people associate Amazon as an e-commerce retailer, it generates very little of its operating cash flow and income from its low-margin online retail marketplace. The trio of catalysts that turn the proverbial hamster wheel for Amazon are its cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nAWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 31% global share, per Canalys, as of the September-ended quarter. Amazon is benefiting from the superior margins AWS provides, as well as the fact that enterprise cloud spending is still in its relatively early innings of expansion. This is a segment that can deliver sustained double-digit growth and should, very soon, surpass $100 billion in annual run-rate revenue.\n\nAdvertising services is maintaining double-digit year-over-year growth, too. Amazon lures well over 2 billion users to its site each month, many of which are motivated shoppers or content viewers (e.g., Prime Video). As one of the most-visited sites on the web, Amazon has little trouble commanding strong ad-pricing power from merchants.\n\nThe third key segment is subscription services, such as Prime. The last update Wall Street received was that Prime surpassed 200 million global subscribers (per then-CEO Jeff Bezos) in April 2021. With the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football, an expansive content library, and shipping perks for its e-e-commerce customers (free two-day delivery on most items), this figure has likely risen quite a bit.\n\nCollectively, these ancillary segments are on pace to more than double Amazon's operating cash flow between 2023 and 2027. Shares of the company are currently valued at roughly 13 times forward-year cash flow, which is 41% below its average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Visa made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 30, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "My 5 Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "It's easy to get swept up in the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Some of the predictions experts are making won't come true. On the other hand, they could be underestimating the changes AI could bring in some ways. That's how it's always been in the early days of a game-changing technology.\n\nMake no mistake, though: AI is a game-changing technology. And it presents what almost certainly is a once-in-a-generation investing opportunity. There are many good choices for investors, but a few especially stand out. Here are my five favorite AI stocks to buy in May, listed alphabetically.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nUnderestimate Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) at your peril. Sure, the company has had a few missteps with its launches of generative AI models. However, Alphabet remains one of the leading innovators in AI with a boatload of cash to invest in research and development.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai boasted recently that Google has \"the best infrastructure for the AI era.\" While that's debatable, he could be right. Thanks to the AI explosion, Google Cloud is unquestionably well-positioned to deliver tremendous growth.\n\nBut could AI render Google Search obsolete? I don't think so. Pichai noted that Google's testing has found increased search usage and higher user satisfaction among people who use its new AI overviews. He stated the company has \"clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud as well as subscriptions.\" I agree.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is another AI pioneer with plenty of room to run. Some might have thought the company would be left behind in the AI race after OpenAI took the world by storm with ChatGPT. If so, they were proved wrong.\n\nLast year, Amazon rolled out wave after wave of new AI technology. As a result, Amazon Web Services (AWS) appears to be in a strong position to maintain its position at the top of the cloud services market. As more AI apps are deployed in the cloud, AWS should grow much larger.\n\nAmazon is also using AI to improve its internal efficiency and help customers. I expect these efforts will continue to show up on the company's bottom line.\n\nFounder Jeff Bezos instilled the mindset that it's always \"day one\" at Amazon (i.e., the company will always think and act like a start-up). With AI, it really is \"day one\" at Amazon.\n\n3. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) might be the most surprising pick on this list. The chipmaker has lost the mojo it once had, losing market share to rivals with less expensive solutions and missing out on the GPU boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, I predict Intel will make a big comeback. The company at long last has some of its swagger back. Intel recently introduced a new AI chip to compete head-to-head with Nvidia, the industry's 800-pound gorilla.\n\nIntel's shares trade at a super-low price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.5, according to LSEG. Even if analysts' growth projections incorporated into this valuation metric are way off, Intel is one of the cheapest AI stocks on the market.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nInvestors bailed on Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) after the company's recent first-quarter update. Meta didn't report disappointing numbers; its revenue and earnings looked great. Instead, the company's projection of higher expenses due to AI and metaverse investments and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's focus in the earnings call on these current money-losing initiatives caused the sell-off.\n\nI think this negative reaction to Meta's update was short-sighted. Zuckerberg mentioned in the Q1 call that the company has experienced significant volatility in the past when it was still in the early stages of investing in new technology. He noted, though, that investors who didn't throw in the towel were rewarded over the long term. I suspect we'll see this pattern play out with Meta's investments in AI and the metaverse.\n\nLike Alphabet and Amazon, Meta is using AI to boost the monetization of its social media platform. The company is also integrating AI into business messaging and smart glasses. I view Meta as a potential sleeping giant (that's really not sleeping) in the AI world.\n\n5. UiPath\n\nI'm not completely biased toward huge AI stocks. UiPath's (NYSE: PATH) market cap is only around $11 billion. This relatively small size is an advantage, in my view.\n\nUiPath is a leader in robotic process automation software. It uses AI extensively throughout its platform. One of the company's AI products even ranked among Time's Best Inventions of 2023.\n\nSince mid-2022, UiPath's annualized revenue run rate has increased by a compound annual growth rate of 32%. The company achieved profitability in its latest quarter. Even though it's been in business for nearly 20 years, UiPath is still only in its early innings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first-quarter, driven by tweaks in its logistics operations, as well as growth in its advertising and cloud computing units, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\n“Delivery speed really matters to customers and we’ve continued to get faster while improving our safety performance,” Jassy said during a call with analysts Tuesday. “Over the past year, we’ve talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped to lower our cost of service. We’ve continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience.”\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) first-quarter revenue rose 13% year-over-year (y/y) to $143.3 billion, topping analyst expectations of $142.6 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 versus estimates of $0.83.\n\nOperating income increased to $13.2 billion in the quarter, compared with $2.7 billion in the same year-ago period. Net income in the quarter increased to $10.6 billion, compared with $0.3 billion last year.\n\nAmazon’s first-quarter revenue from third-party sellers services, which includes commissions collected by Amazon, fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew 16% y/y to $34.5 billion.\n\nThe company expects revenue of $144 billion to $149 billion for the second-quarter ending in June. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion.AmazonQ1/24Q1/23Y/Y % ChangeRevenueOperating incomeNet incomeShipping costsAdjusted earnings per share\n\nAmazon’s first-quarter shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, was $21.8 billion, a 10% y/y increase compared to the same period in 2023. The company delivered more than 2 billion global units arriving the same or next day in first-quarter, according to a news release.\n\nJassy said the company has worked to increase the consolidation of shipping units into fewer boxes at its fulfillment centers to help lower costs.\n\nAmazon has more than 100 fulfillment and sortation centers in the U.S. and more than 185 centers globally. The states with the most Amazon warehouse locations are California, Texas, Illinois, Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\n“As we further optimize our network, we’ve seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, which is an important driver for reducing our costs,” Jassy said. “We’re able to consolidate more units into a box. It results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve and lowers our carbon impact.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is also making “efforts to revamp our U.S. inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers,” Jassy said.\n\nSo far in 2024, Amazon has reduced its air cargo operations from 53 to 47 U.S. airports, including closing its air cargo operation at the San Antonio International Airport in April.\n\nAmazon currently has 1.52 million employees across the globe, a 4% y/y increase compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nJassy also discussed Supply Chain by Amazon, a new logistics-as-a-service offering announced in September. Supply Chain by Amazon is an end-to-end supply chain service across all channels to shippers that don’t have to be on Amazon’s e-commerce platform.\n\n“I think it’s just really early days, it is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us, we have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business,” Jassy said. “We think it will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third party sellers. But our third-party sellers find high value with us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves.”\n\nMore articles by Noi Mahoney\n\nChina boosts its Mexico investments as nearshoring opportunities grow\n\nTruckstop CEO: Industry uniting in fight against load board fraud\n\nBorderlands Mexico: US-Mexico trade rises to $67B in February\n\nThe post Amazon reports $143B in Q1 revenue, topping Wall Street expectations appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

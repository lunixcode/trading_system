        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Meta said on Friday its flagship app Facebook is attracting its highest number of young adults in three years, as it tries to shake the platform's reputation as the bastion of an older generation.\n\nMore than 40 million U.S. and Canadian adults aged 18 to 29 now check Facebook daily, the social media company said, in its first-ever release of such demographic information. Facebook, whose founder Mark Zuckerberg turned 40 last month, marked its 20th anniversary this year.\n\nThe growth reflects the company's efforts in the last few years to recapture the attention of young adults who have been flocking to short video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeta charted \"five quarters of healthy app usage growth\" among young adults, a company spokesperson said.\n\nAt an event in New York aimed at highlighting how young people use the app, Meta's head of Facebook Tom Alison said the anniversary prompted executives to realize Facebook needed to evolve to stay relevant for the next generation.\n\n\"Who is Facebook for? Is it for my parents?\" Alison said, citing questions he said he had heard from young adults.\n\nAlison told Reuters in an interview that young users appeared to be coming to Facebook initially to use sections like Marketplace, Groups and Dating at key moments in their lives, such as when they needed to furnish apartments for the first time.\n\nWhile most of those sections do not feature ads, their usage was driving engagement broadly, he added.\n\n\"Once they're on Facebook, they go and they check out stuff that's going on in Feed or from Reels,\" he said, referring to Meta's TikTok-like short video product.\n\nFacebook, founded in a Harvard University dorm in 2004, spread like wildfire across U.S. college campuses after it launched and quickly became the default mass communications platform for a generation of internet users. The app amassed 50 million users within its first three years and now has 3.2 billion users globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong the way, however, it became less attractive to the young users who drive consumer fads and are considered crucial by the advertisers responsible for most of Meta's ad sales.\n\nOnly about a third of U.S. teens say they use Facebook, according to a survey last year by research organization Pew, a sharp drop compared to previous surveys the group conducted in 2014 and 2015.\n\nBy comparison, the share of all U.S. adults who say they use Facebook has remained relatively flat since 2016 at around 68%, Pew has said.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Rod Nickel and Shri Navaratnam)",

        "content": "Not all dividend stocks are good, and you should always keep an eye out for dividend stocks to sell if they don’t perform well. Dividend payments from publicly traded companies reached a record $164.3 billion in this year’s first quarter, up 7% from a year ago. Data from the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index shows that many U.S. companies are returning excess cash to shareholders. Blue-chip companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have raised their quarterly dividends. Other companies, such as Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), have paid special one-time dividends.\n\nStill, other companies, such as Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS), have reinstated their dividend after suspending it during the pandemic. Some companies, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have paid their first dividend ever this year. While distributions to stockholders seem to be popular, not every company is joining the party. Some companies have dramatically reduced their dividend or stopped paying one altogether, drawing the ire of investors.\n\nHere are dividend duds: three dividend stocks to sell before they drain your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDividend Stocks to Sell: Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL) The logo for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc (CBRL) is displayed on a restaurant store front.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe only thing U.S. restaurant chain Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL) had going for it was a dividend with one of the highest yields on Wall Street at 9.08%. Unfortunately, Cracker Barrel cut its quarterly payout by 80%, sending investors running for the exits and its share price spiraling downwards. The cut has previously reduced the dividend to 25 cents per share from $1.30.\n\nThe company, which operates a chain of restaurants and gift stores, said the dividend payout is being cut to reallocate capital towards overhauling its brand and stores. The company also warned that its upcoming fiscal third- and fourth-quarter results will likely be below expectations due to weak customer traffic. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store provided no guidance. CBRL stock is down 55% in the last 12 months.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) also saw its stock take a big hit after the company cut its quarterly dividend payout to shareholders by nearly 50%. Walgreens lowered its dividend to 25 cents a share from 48 cents, a reduction of 48%. The company said the dividend cut strengthened its long-term balance sheet and cash position.\n\nBefore the cut, Walgreens paid a dividend that yielded more than 7%, which made it the highest-paying dividend stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Note: Walgreens was kicked out of the Dow this spring and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The dividend cut also marked the first time in nearly 50 years that Walgreens reduced its distribution to stockholders. WBA stock has fallen 50% in the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) cut its dividend by 66% to 12.5 cents per share as it looks to redirect cash into building foundries that will design the microchips and semiconductors it and other companies design. While the dividend cut has hurt shareholders’ returns, there is little evidence that it has helped the company or its pivot to become a chip foundry business.\n\nIntel continues to report disappointing financial results and a poor showing for its foundry operations. For this year’s first quarter, the company announced that Intel Foundry had $4.4 billion in revenue, down 10% from a year earlier. Intel also continues to report forward guidance that is below Wall Street expectations. All the bad news has conspired to hurt INTC stock, which has declined 37% in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MSFT.

        "content": "Social media has become a huge part of our lives and the increasing amount of time we spend on it is proof that it is indispensable to us. Social media giants make a huge amount of money from advertising on their platforms, and marketers are now ready to expand their budgets and attract new customers. This means social media companies are going to have an excellent 2024; the momentum is already set, and now is the time for smart investors to make their move and take a position in social media stocks.\n\nWith a steady rise in the number of users worldwide, these companies are set to grow. Social media advertising will dominate this decade, and investors should have these social media stocks on their radar.  Let’s take a look at them.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, you guessed it!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), one of the biggest social media giants is the first stock that comes to mind. It has bounced back and how! The company suffered more than it deserved to, and the stock went as low as $99 in 2022, but it has gained strength and is exchanging hands for $474 today. The stock is up 80% in the past 12 months and 36% year-to-date. This speaks a lot about the company’s ability to bounce back from any situation.\n\nMeta Platforms got a huge boost from the growth in online advertising, and this helped the revenue soar. In the first quarter, its advertising revenue jumped 27% to hit $35.64 billion. It saw a 17% increase in net income and a 7% increase in users across all its apps.\n\nIt also announced a dividend of $0.50 per share per quarter and is taking a $50 billion share buyback program. The company has gained attention for its Metaverse investments. It has increased the cost projections for metaverse and it shows that the management is going aggressively behind this ambitious project. The high capital spend will give a boost to artificial intelligence abilities and generate a higher return on the investments.\n\nMeta has set a solid momentum for the second half of the year, and it could hit $500 very soon.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nUp 16% YTD and 72% in the past 12 months, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock has been on a solid rally and is trading for $42 as of writing. This is a solid rebound from the lows of $19 it hit in 2022. The platform allows people to share photos and videos and it had some of its best days during the pandemic. However, the days after the pandemic were quite difficult but Pinterest managed to not only survive but thrive.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has 500 million monthly active users and the fundamentals have been impressive. Pinterest beat EPS and revenue expectations with a 23% jump in revenue in the first quarter to hit $740 million. Its net losses dropped 88% to $25 million in the quarter, and the average revenue per user jumped 10% YOY, driven by gains in North America.\n\nThis was a milestone quarter for the company and it has set the road for growth in 2024. Besides becoming a highly reliable advertising platform, Pinterest has also grown its e-commerce segment.\n\nJust like Meta, Pinterest is also benefitting from online advertising, and this is one area where it can keep growing. Having posted a healthy comeback, I think Pinterest’s worst days are over, and it is set to keep moving higher.\n\n15 analysts on TipRanks have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $46, a 9% upside.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Silhouette man using smartphone with Reddit (RDDT) logo on blurred background is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter its recent debut on the stock market, Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) stock is already up 29% in the past month and is trading for $57. There is a major catalyst that has led to this jump. Reddit has entered into a partnership with OpenAI.\n\nThrough this partnership, more users are expected to move towards Reddit. Since OpenAI has agreed to be an advertising partner for Reddit, this can help improve advertising and impact the revenue. While this partnership is fairly new, we will only be able to see its impact on the financials in the coming quarters.\n\nHowever, Reddit impressed investors with the first-quarter results and it was also its first earnings report after going public. It reported a better-than-expected quarter with sales of $243 million and a loss of $8.19 per share. The sales jumped 48% YOY, and it reported 82.7 million daily active users. Its average revenue per user also increased 8% YOY to $2.94.\n\nReddit is making the most of its early days after its debut on the stock market, and getting in on this ride will benefit long-term investors. While the company has a lot to prove, it is on its way to making the most of the opportunity of social media advertising.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's data protection watchdog AEPD has ordered the provisional suspension of two planned Meta products set to be deployed in the upcoming European election on its social media platforms Instagram and Facebook, it said on Friday.\n\nThe tools, named \"Election Day Information\" (EDI) and \"Voter Information Unit\" (VIU), would potentially violate the Spanish data protection regulation (GDPR), AEPD said.\n\n\"Our election tools have been expressly designed to respect users' privacy and comply with the GDPR. While we disagree with the AEPD's assessment in this case, we have cooperated with their request,\" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nAccording to the agency, Meta has said it intends that all eligible Instagram and Facebook users in the European Union will receive notifications from VIU and EDI reminding them to vote.\n\n\"The data processing envisaged by Meta would be contrary to Spanish data protection regulation and would, at the very least, breach the data protection principles of lawfulness, data minimisation and limitation of the retention period,\" the AEPD said in a statement.\n\nIt added that Meta was selecting eligible voters based on the data contained in users' profiles about their city of residence, as well as their IP addresses. But the only condition to be allowed to vote in the European election is being an adult national of any of the EU's member states.\n\nThe AEPD said this data treatment was \"unnecessary, disproportionate and excessive\" because it left out EU citizens living abroad and targeted citizens of non-EU countries who are in Europe.\n\nThe agency added that collecting data on users' ages was not justified, as there was no reliable mechanism to verify their self-reported ages, and the treatment of interaction data was \"totally disproportionate in relation to the supposed purpose of informing about the elections\".\n\nThe watchdog said Meta had not justified the need for storing the data after the election, which \"reveals an additional purpose for the processing operation\".\n\n(Reporting by David Latona; Editing by Inti Landauro and Giles Elgood)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "New Mexico judge grants Mark Zuckerberg’s request to be dropped from child safety lawsuit",
        "content": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A New Mexico judge on Thursday granted Mark Zuckerberg’s request to be dropped from a lawsuit that alleges his company has failed to protect young users from exposure to child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe case is one of many filed by states, school districts and parents against Meta and its social media platforms over concerns about child exploitation. Beyond courtrooms around the U.S., the issue has been a topic of congressional hearings as lawmakers and parents are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media on young people’s lives.\n\nIn New Mexico, Attorney General Raúl Torrez sued Meta and Zuckerberg late last year following an undercover online investigation. The civil lawsuit echoed the claims of those levied in late October by the attorneys general of 33 states — including California and New York — that Instagram and Facebook include features deliberately designed to hook children and contribute to the youth mental health crisis.\n\nJudge Bryan Biedscheid said he wasn't persuaded by the state's arguments that Zuckerberg should remain a party to the New Mexico lawsuit, but he noted that could change depending on what evidence is presented as the case against Meta proceeds.\n\nTorrez's office said it will continue to assess whether Zuckerberg should be named individually in the future.\n\nAttorneys for Meta had argued during the hearing that prosecutors would not be able to establish that the company had specifically directed its activities to New Mexico residents, meaning there would be personal jurisdiction for which the company could be held liable. They said the platforms are available worldwide and that users agree to the terms of service when signing up.\n\nThe judge disagreed, dismissing the company's motion to dismiss the state's claims.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that New Mexico is not seeking to hold Meta accountable for its content but rather its role in pushing out that content through complex algorithms that proliferate material that can be sensational, addictive and harmful.\n\nThe design features and how people interact with them are the issue, said Serena Wheaton, an assistant attorney general in the consumer protection division.\n\nEarlier this month, Torrez announced charges against three men who were accused of using Meta’s social media platforms to target and solicit sex with underage children. The arrests were the result of a monthslong undercover operation in which the suspects connected with decoy accounts set up by the state Department of Justice.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat investigation began in December around the time the state filed its lawsuit against the company.\n\nAt the time of the arrests, Torrez placed blame on Meta executives — including Zuckerberg — and suggested that the company was putting profits above the interests of parents and children.\n\nMeta has disputed those allegations, saying it uses technology to prevent suspicious adults from finding or interacting with children and teens on its apps and that it works with law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting offenders.\n\nAs part of New Mexico's lawsuit, prosecutors say they have uncovered internal documents in which Meta employees estimate about 100,000 children every day are subjected to sexual harassment on the company’s platforms.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) ended the recent trading session at $467.05, demonstrating a -1.54% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.6% for the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.86%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.08%.\n\nThe social media company's shares have seen an increase of 8.01% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.76% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $4.67, reflecting a 44.58% increase from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $38.15 billion, indicating a 19.22% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $20.19 per share and revenue of $158.97 billion, which would represent changes of +35.78% and +17.84%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.4% higher. Meta Platforms is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nIn the context of valuation, Meta Platforms is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 23.49. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.28, so one might conclude that Meta Platforms is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nOne should further note that META currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.23. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. META's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.7 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 61, putting it in the top 25% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

        "title": "Institutional Bets: 7 Stocks the Big Money Will Send Higher This Year",
        "content": "Institutional investors represent the so-called big money that wields significant influence over the stock market. That influence manifests in many ways.\n\nA negative view of institutional investors is that they only care about themselves, not smaller retail investors, and they simply have too much control overall. A more positive take is that institutional investors, with their long-term outlook and focus on stability, tend to stabilize stock prices.\n\nRegardless, it’s fair to state that following institutional investors is often a strong strategy. Institutions have the ability to pool resources and buy large blocks of securities. That has a significant impact on price, for one. Further, institutional investors tend to have greater experience and more detailed knowledge of market constituents. That wealth of experience often leads to better outcomes and stronger returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s why paying attention to the institutional bets big money is making in the stock market this year is a wise strategy.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhether measured by value or number of positions opened this year, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has significant institutional interest.\n\nBy March of 2024, the total value of institutional ownership in Meta Platforms stood at nearly $722 billion. That made it the 6th most held investment by institutions on a sheer dollar value basis. A total of 808 institutional investors opened a position in Meta Platforms in March. During that. institutional investors only opened more positions in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt shouldn’t be surprising that META stock has surged in 2024. Year to date, it is up by more than 32%. Meta Platforms revenues skyrocketed by 27% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, net income more than doubled, growing by 117% during the same period.\n\nThe company has made serious progress with its Llama 3 AI. It clearly has aspirations to be among the most important AI firms overall. Beyond that, Meta’s ad impression and ad pricing metrics are each rising impressively. That’s a testament to the resurgent ad revenue that dominates the company’s overall business.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nInstitutional investors held nearly $430 billion worth of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock at the end of March. Only eight firms were more widely held by institutions at that point. It’s certainly a strong indication of how important and well-regarded the firm is. The company remains one of the most important semiconductor design, software and chip infrastructure companies on Earth.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think one of the most important aspects to understand here in relation to the institutional ownership of Broadcom is the stability inherent in it as an investment. First of all, institutional investors tend to make long-term investments, which lends stability to those stocks, given the sheer volume of resources they can place therein. Institutional investors have only placed more resources in eight other firms in 2024. That inherently makes AVGO shares stable.\n\nBroadcom is stable as an investment otherwise. The company provides a dividend, which is a sign of stability. It last reduced that dividend in 2011 and has a healthy payout ratio.\n\nLithium Americas (Argentina) (LAAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (Argentina) (NYSE:LAAC) is among the more interesting stocks on this list simply because it is somewhat unexpected. A lot of the firms Wall Street is betting on are very large and well-known. They generally do not surprise and include many names from the Magnificent Seven and a select few others.\n\nLithium Americas (Argentina) is an interesting choice because there has been such a sharp increase in Wall Street’s attention to the company. Institutional ownership increased by more than 1,700% in March.\n\nRemember, this is not the Lithium Americas stock that holds rights to the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. It is the other half of the company, which was earlier divided to isolate Thacker Pass for its outsized potential.\n\nIt’s also a company that is currently producing lithium. The company produced 4,500 tons of lithium during the fourth quarter and is on track to produce as much as 40,000 tons in all of 2024.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock continues to be volatile and difficult to pin down for investors big and small.\n\nCEO Bob Iger has made significant strides toward driving profitability from the company’s streaming segment. The company focused on aggressive cost-cutting and was seen by some as a sign of potential stagnation. Those detractors believed the efforts signaled a lack of viable growth targets and overall growth potential. Whether those detractors are right or wrong remains to be seen. However, the stock has fallen since then.\n\nYet, Walt Disney shares have still grown by 12% in 2024. And the streaming segment did prove profitable in the first quarter. Disney is focused on quality. That will manifest as a decreased focus on Marvel films, in particular.\n\nI believe the company is making strides to return to its former glory. Yes, Disney did miss important guidance metrics, but the big shift toward quality over quantity matters.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is tops among institutional investor bets, as measured by multiple metrics. Whether it’s total value, number of positions opened, holdings by number of filers or percentage increase in shares held, Nvidia stock is among the top five.\n\nFollowing another quarter of strong earnings those institutional investors are upping their bets on Nvidia, even as it pushes past the $1,000 per share mark. TD Cowen just upped its target price on Nvidia to $1,200.\n\nEven that $1,200 target price could be low, given that Nvidia just posted its highest-ever quarterly profits and sales figures. In fact, other analysts already assigned higher target prices to Nvidia even before this most recent earnings blowout.\n\nAnyway, retail investors should expect their institutional counterparts to up their respective bets on Nvidia following this most recent news. Investors big and small have plenty of reason to remain highly optimistic about Nvidia at this point.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is another stock in which many institutional owners have recently opened positions. The company itself is in an interesting position, given its competitor status to Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s strong earnings report sent AMD shares lower. The reasoning behind the slide is that Nvidia is so strong that AMD has little chance of making headway at the moment — at least, that’s how I make sense of the 3% price drop in AMD.\n\nI also think it’s an overreaction. Powerful forces in the computing world will again consider AMD because it offers strong computing power at a lower price than Nvidia. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is chief among those firms to watch in relation to that narrative. It is leveraging AMD’s MI300x chips heavily.\n\nAMD can bask in that role while continuing to improve its chips in the hope that it can one day outperform those from Nvidia. It’s a decent position to be in from the perspective that the company doesn’t face the substantial pricing pressure that Nvidia does.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nUnsurprisingly, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is among the stocks that Wall Street and Main Street continue to bet on in 2024. The already strong stock will likely continue to strengthen. Mounjaro and Zepbound have proven to be incredible drivers of growth for the company in 2024.\n\nFirst quarter revenues jumped by 26% on the strength of those weight loss drugs. Eli Lilly has an excellent opportunity to establish its place among the most valuable stocks through the rest of the decade. Simply put, it has won the early rounds of the weight loss drug wars. First-quarter sales were well above levels anticipated on Wall Street. That prompted Eli Lilly to raise its 2024 sales forecast. Zepbound and Mounjaro will likely fulfill their promise as blockbuster drugs that rewrite sales figures in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly continues to progress toward a once-weekly insulin injection. Demand for such an injection will likely be very strong, given that it would replace the once-daily injections required now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meta Revamped Facebook’s Feed to Fend off TikTok, Win Back Younger Users",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. has spent the last several years overhauling its flagship social networking app, tweaking people’s feeds to feature a broader array of posts and videos in an effort to stave off competition from TikTok and win back younger users.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Becomes First Former US President Guilty of Crimes World’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar South Africa Election Results With 29% Voting Districts In Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump\n\nIn late 2021, TikTok was on the rise, Facebook interactions were declining after a pandemic boom and young people were leaving the social network in droves. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg assembled a handful of veterans who’d built their careers on the Big Blue app to figure out how to stop the bleeding, including head of product Chris Cox, Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, WhatsApp lead Will Cathcart and head of Facebook, Tom Alison.\n\nDuring discussions that spanned several meetings, a private WhatsApp group, and an eventual presentation at Zuckerberg’s house in Palo Alto, California, the group came to a decision: The best way to revive Facebook’s status as an online destination for young people was to start serving up more content from outside a person’s network of friends and family.\n\nJust over two years later, the shift has shown signs of success. Facebook’s user base in the US and Canada — the most important markets for the company’s core advertising business — is suddenly growing again after years of stagnation. Young adults in those markets are using Facebook more than they have in years, and advertising revenue continues to rise.\n\nMeta’s move was precipitated by the TikTok juggernaut. The short-form video app owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., exploded in popularity around 2020 by serving up an addictive stream of personalized content based on a user’s interests and preferences. Facebook, by contrast, had largely relied on users’ online connections – the friends and family that made up their “social graph” – to determine what posts people saw.\n\nAs TikTok occupied ever more attention amid the younger crowd, Meta’s top brass decided in late 2021 that Facebook needed to do something similar and began building new “recommendation” algorithms. It was a notable departure from the “social graph” strategy that had defined Facebook’s service for nearly two decades.\n\n‘Threshold Decision’\n\n“This did feel very much like one of those threshold decisions,” said Alison, who still runs the Facebook app. “It was scary because there was always this underlying fear of — if you go in that direction, do you walk away from your social heritage? Does a lot of the social activity on the site that makes it what it is, does that go away as well?”\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Meta took the plunge and made “recommendations” a core part of its product strategy. Its top priority for deploying the new algorithm was initially in Reels, a TikTok clone that debuted on Instagram in 2020. Today, 50% of the content people see on Instagram is considered a “recommendation” from an AI algorithm.\n\nThe company also started pushing outside content within Facebook’s Feed toward the end of 2021, a significant decision considering the main social network was still the company’s most lucrative product. Making that change within a new product like Reels was an easy decision, but there was concern that tinkering with the flow of content in what used to be known as the News Feed could drive down Facebook usage or hurt Meta’s business.\n\nThat doesn’t seem to be the case, at least so far. Today, an average of 30% of the posts that people see in their Facebook Feed are suggestions from outside of their network, more than double the number from two years ago. Advertising revenue, meanwhile, was up 15% in 2023 compared with 2021.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, Facebook is having a notable resurgence in user growth. Its audience in the US and Canada grew by 10 million people over 2022 and 2023. It didn’t add any net new users in 2021.\n\nFacebook is even growing in popularity again with 18-to-29-year-olds, a demographic that had been on the decline for years. Pew Research found that 67% of US adults in that category used Facebook in 2023, down from 81% five years earlier. But the company’s flagship social network has seen five straight quarters of growth from daily active users in that age range in the US and Canada, a spokesperson said. It now has more than 40 million young adults using Facebook every day, its highest total in three years, the spokesperson added.\n\nIt’s a stark reversal that runs counter to the broader narrative around Facebook, that the flagship network is mostly for “older” people. It’s unclear if Feed changes are the main driver of that growth, but Meta executives are encouraged nonetheless. What’s materialized is not necessarily an abandonment of the friends and family mindset that made Facebook dominant for years, but rather a new level of comfort in straying from that strategy when necessary.\n\n“If the first thing you see in your news feed – if the best thing for you in that moment is a recommendation – we should be able to show that to you,” Alison said. “We hadn’t quite wrapped our heads around that yet” in 2021.\n\nMeta’s push toward “recommendations” may have been inspired by TikTok, but it was also made possible by recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology, company leaders say.\n\nShowing people content related to their social circle typically means Meta’s algorithms need to rank content from a pool of, at most, a couple thousand posts. Pushing content to people from outside of their network, though, increases the pool of potential posts exponentially. Now, any of the billions of photos, links or videos on Facebook could theoretically be a fit for a given user, creating a more elaborate ranking challenge that the company is still perfecting.\n\nIn 2022, Meta engineers spent a lot of time and resources moving the new algorithms from CPU processors to more powerful — and expensive — GPU processors that can more quickly analyze greater volumes of data, Alison said. This strategy has also become a key talking point with investors.\n\n“Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platforms demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they’re not connected to,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Meta’s latest earnings call. The company also told investors that it was increasing capital expenditures for the year, in part to spend more on AI.\n\nUniversal Recommendation Algorithm\n\nThis strategy has been a reversal of sorts from prior Feed changes. In 2018, Meta publicly updated Facebook’s algorithm to show more posts from friends and family at the expense of content from businesses and media organizations. Zuckerberg described it at the time as leaning in toward “meaningful social interactions.”\n\n“Too often today, watching video, reading news or getting a page update is just a passive experience,” he wrote at the time.\n\nMeta insists the company’s focus on “recommendations” isn’t an abandonment of friends and family content, but rather a new balance between the two. Alison said Meta has been careful to try and avoid a scenario where the things you see on Facebook are the exact same posts you can find anywhere else online.\n\n“How do you lean into recommendations but then how do you still do that in a way that honors and takes advantage of our social heritage?” he said. “You could end up in a place where you just become commoditized, like you’re recommending the same stuff as everybody else. So we went through all those debates.”\n\nMeta has plans to expand “recommendations” further. Right now, most of the company’s algorithms are product-specific – the algorithm for Feed is different than the one for Reels, which is different than the one for Facebook Marketplace, its Craigslist competitor.\n\nBut Meta is working on a more universal algorithm that could work across all its various features. In a perfect world, a user who visits Marketplace to buy an Instant Pot, for example, might then also see recommendations for cooking-related content within other products, like Groups or Reels.\n\n“That is a big focus for us I would say this year,” Alison said. “If we are right, you’re going to have the Instant Pot experience much more frequently across many more products.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo’s Race to Boost Supplies Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Israel’s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another ‘Lost Decade’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Is Pinterest (PINS) Up 4.1% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Pinterest (PINS). Shares have added about 4.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Pinterest due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nPinterest Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Surge Y/Y\n\nPinterest reported strong first-quarter 2024 results, with the bottom and top lines surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The San Francisco-based Internet content provider reported revenue growth year over year, driven by strong user growth across all regions.\r\n\r\nIts lower funnel solutions suite, including mobile deep linking, API for conversions and clean rooms, and Direct Links, is providing a sustained return on investments to advertisers. Growing investments in AI-integrated tools have improved relevancy and shoppability across the platform. Expanding third-party ad ecosystem to boost monetization is also supporting the top line.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, the company reported a net loss of $24.8 million or a loss of 4 cents per share compared to a net loss of $208.6 million or 31 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Top-line improvement and lower operating expenses led to a narrower loss during the quarter.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP net income was $139.5 million or 20 cents per share, up from $57.7 million or 8 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents.\n\nRevenues\n\nDuring the quarter, net sales rose to $740 million, up from $603 million in the prior-year quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $700 million. Pinterest witnessed 12% year-over-year growth in global monthly active users (MAUs) to 518 million, an all-time record.\r\n\r\nHealthy growth in MAUs is a compound effect of a range of initiatives focused on personalization, increasing shoppability and actionability and creating a positive alternative to other social media platforms. The company continues to invest in AI to generate highly relevant content across users’ multi-session commercial journeys.\r\n\r\nIt is witnessing solid traction among Gen Z users, which account for more than 40% of the users and is one of the fastest-growing demographics on the platform. Along with various ad formats and measurement tools, the company is bringing AI-based automation to support retailers and advertisers, driving more conversion by capitalizing on the commercial intent of the users.\r\n\r\nThe company witnessed solid adoption of its lower funnel formats and tools. Direct Link product that takes users to an advertiser’s page with a single click is gaining strong popularity among advertisers. 97% of lower funnel revenue came from Direct Links.\r\n\r\nAlong with an improvement in lower funnel solutions, the company is also seeing growing adoption of its measurement tools. Pinterest’s privacy-centric measurement tools offer advertisers conversion visibility and deliver vital insights to optimize campaign strategy for specific goals. In the first quarter, ad impressions, including both organic and paid impressions, increased by 38%.\n\nThe company is also expanding its third-party partner ecosystem. The company is partnering with Amazon Ads in the United States and Google Ads Manager in unmonetized international markets. Third-party ad formats positively contributed to revenues during the quarter.\r\n \r\nThe United States and Canada generated $592 million in revenues, up 22% year over year. Net sales beat our revenue estimate of $539.8 million. Solid momentum in retail and emerging verticals, including financial services and technology, supported the net sales.\r\n\r\nRevenues from Europe totaled $118 million, up 27% from $93 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line missed our estimate of $124.6 million. Healthy traction in retail and CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) ensured top-line growth in this region.\r\n\r\nNet sales from the Rest of World rose to $30 million from $24 million recorded in the prior-year quarter, missing our revenue estimate of $34.4 million.\r\n\r\nMAUs from the United States and Canada were 98 million, up 3% year over year. The quarterly figure surpassed our estimate of 97 million. The Rest of World registered MAUs of 279 million, up 16% from 240 million in the year-earlier quarter. It missed our estimate of 288.2 million. MAUs from Europe increased to 140 million from 128 million in the year-ago quarter and fell short of our estimate of 142.7 million.\r\n\r\nIn the March quarter, the global average revenues per user (ARPU) stood at $1.46 compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.32. ARPU in Europe improved 17% year over year to 86 cents, while the United States and Canada rose 19% to $6.05. ARPU from the Rest of World increased 8% year over year to 11 cents.\n\nOther Details\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $112.9 million in first-quarter 2024, up from the prior-year quarter’s tally of $27 million. The improvement is primarily attributed to disciplined cost management and solid revenue growth.\r\n\r\nTotal costs and expenses were $794.4 million, down from $846.3 million in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, research and development expenses rose to $280.3 million from $266.3 million. Administrative costs decreased to $106.7 million from $207.9 million a year ago.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company generated $356.1 million of cash from operating activities compared with $183.5 million in the prior-year period. As of Mar 31, 2024, Pinterest had cash and cash equivalents of $1.63 billion, with $154.3 million of operating lease liabilities.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Pinterest expects revenue in the range of $835-850 million, indicating 18-20% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected in the range of $490-505 million, suggesting 11-15% growth year over year.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 66.67% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Pinterest has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Pinterest has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nPinterest belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry. Another stock from the same industry, Meta Platforms (META), has gained 8% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "One Tech Tip: Want to turn off Meta AI? You can't — but there are some workarounds",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — If you use Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram, you've probably noticed a new character pop up answering search queries or eagerly offering tidbits of information in your feeds, with varying degrees of accuracy.\n\nIt's Meta AI, and it's here to help, at least according to Meta Platforms' CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who calls it “the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.”\n\nThe chatbot can recommend local restaurants, offer more information on something you see in a Facebook post, search for airline flights or generate images in the blink of an eye. If you're chatting with friends to plan a night out, you can invite it into your group conversation by typing @MetaAI, then ask it to recommend, say, cocktail bars.\n\nMeta’s AI tool has been integrated into chat boxes and search bars throughout the tech giant’s platforms. The assistant appears, for example, at the top of your chat list on Messenger. Ask it questions about anything or to “imagine” something and it will generate a picture or animation.\n\nAs with any new technology, there are, of course, hiccups, including bizarre exchanges when the chatbots first started engaging with real people. One joined a Facebook moms’ group to talk about its gifted child. Another tried to give away nonexistent items to confused members of a Buy Nothing forum.\n\nMeta AI hasn't been universally welcomed. Here are some tips if you want to avoid using it:\n\nCAN I TURN IT OFF?\n\nSome Facebook users don't like the chatbot, complaining in online forums that they're tired of having AI foisted on them all the time or that they just want to stick with what they know. So what if you don't want Meta AI butting in every time you search for something or scroll through your social feeds? Well, you might need a time machine. Meta and other tech companies are in an AI arms race, churning out new language models and persuading — some might say pressuring — the public to use them.\n\nThe bad news is there's no one button to turn off Meta AI on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp. However, if you want to limit it, there are some (imperfect) workarounds.\n\nMUTE...SORT OF\n\nOn the Facebook mobile app, tap the “search” button. You may get a prompt to “Ask Meta AI anything.” Tap the blue triangle on the right, then the blue circle with an “i” inside it. Here, you'll see a “mute” button, with options to silence the chatbot for 15 minutes or longer, or “Until I change it.” You can do the same on Instagram.\n\nNonetheless, muting doesn't get rid of Meta AI completely. Meta AI's circle logo might still appear where the search magnifying glass used to be — and tapping on it will take you to the Meta AI field. This is now the new way to search in Meta, and just as with Google's AI summaries, the responses will be generated by AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nI asked the chatbot about searching Facebook without Meta AI results.\n\n“Meta AI aims to be a helpful assistant and is in the search bar to assist with your questions,\" it responded. Then it added, \"You can't disable it from this experience, but you can tap the search button after writing your query and search how you normally would.”\n\nThen I asked a (human) Meta spokesperson.\n\n“You can search how you normally would and choose to engage with a variety of results — ones from Meta AI or others that appear as you type,” the spokesperson said in a statement. \"And when interacting with Meta AI, you have access to real-time information without having to leave the app you’re using thanks to our search partnerships.”\n\nLike an over-eager personal assistant, Meta AI also pops up under posts on your Facebook news feed, offering more information about what’s discussed in the post — such as the subject of a news article. It’s not possible to disable this feature, so you'll just have to ignore it.\n\nUSE OLD SCHOOL FACEBOOK\n\nTech websites have noted that one surefire way to avoid Facebook's AI assistant is to use the social network's stripped-down mobile site, mbasic.facebook.com. It's aimed at people in developing countries using older phones on slower internet connections. The basic site has a retro feel that looks crude compared to the current version, and it looks even worse on desktop browsers, but it still works on a rudimentary level and without AI.\n\nOTHER COUNTRIES\n\nMeta AI is so far only available in the United States and 13 other countries including Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. So if you don't live in any of those places, you don't have to worry about the chatbot because you don't get to use it. At least not yet.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks That Look Even Better After Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "Dividend payments offer many benefits to investors. In fact, 75% of the returns in the S&P 500 between 1980 and 2019 came from dividends, according to market data. Dividend payments are currently at an all-time high. The Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index just released data showing that dividend payments from publicly traded U.S. companies hit a record $164.3 billion in this year’s first quarter, up 7% from a year earlier.\n\nBlue-chip companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) each raised their dividend payments this year. At the same time, other company’s such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced their first-ever dividend payouts. Janus Henderson said that it expects global dividend payments to rise 5% by year’s end and reach a record of $1.72 trillion for all of 2024.\n\nClearly companies are recognizing the importance of returning a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividend payments. Here are three dividend stocks to buy that look even better after Q1 earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM), the company behind Post-it notes, saw its stock rise 7% after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results. For Q1, 3M announced EPS of $2.39 and revenues of $7.7 billion. Analysts had been looking for a profit of $2.10 a share and revenue of $7.6 billion. The latest results included numbers for the recently spun off healthcare business, Solventum (NYSE:SOLV), which became its own publicly traded company on April 1 of this year.\n\nIn addition to the Solventum spinoff, 3M finalized two major legal settlements, agreeing to pay $10.3 billion to address chemical spills in drinking water and $6 billion to resolve lawsuits related to its military earplugs. The company also replaced longtime CEO Mike Roman on May 1 with Bill Brown as the new head of 3M. This brings us to the dividend. 3M recently cut it by 54%. However, that was less than feared and it still leaves the company with a quarterly payout that yields nearly 3%, which is better than most stocks.\n\nOver the past 12 months, MMM stock has risen 23%.\n\nMacy’s (M) Macy's (M) logo on storefront in city with white sky behind\n\nSource: Joe Tabacca / Shutterstock.com\n\nMacy’s (NYSE:M) recently reported a Q1 profit that topped Wall Street forecasts as the retailer’s turnaround strategy gathers momentum. The department store chain reported EPS of 27 cents versus 15 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $4.85 billion, narrowly missing the $4.86 billion that was the consensus forecast on Wall Street. The company is undertaking an aggressive turnaround strategy as it tries to grow sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this year, Macy’s announced plans to close 150 of its outlets, more than 25% of its namesake locations. However, the company plans to open more Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, as well as smaller Macy’s stores located in suburban strip malls. In its earnings release, Macy’s said that it “views 2024 as a transition and investment year.”\n\nAs for its dividend, Macy’s pays a quarterly distribution to stockholders of 17 cents per share, giving M stock a strong yield of 3.38%. Macy’s share price has increased 46% in the last 12 months.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola ko stock\n\nSource: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs is almost always the case, beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reported Q1 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. The company said it continues to benefit from price increases in the current inflationary environment. Coke announced EPS of 72 cents versus 70 cents that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue amounted to $11.30 billion compared to forecasts of $11.01 billion. Sales were up 11% from a year ago.\n\nEarlier this year, Coca-Cola raised its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 5.4%. The company now pays stockholders a quarterly dividend of 48.5 cents per share, up from 46 cents previously. The dividend yield on KO stock is at 3.15% based on the current share price. Another reason for Coke to be one of the dividend stocks to buy is this marks 62 consecutive years that Coke has increased its dividend payment. Among a select group of companies known as “dividend kings,” Coke has boosted their payouts for 50 years or more.\n\nKO stock has gained 3% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be the 5 Largest Trillion-Dollar Stocks by 2035 (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "If there's one constant on Wall Street every investor should be aware of, it's change. History shows that, over time, Wall Street's biggest companies by market cap are constantly being reshuffled.\n\nIn 2000, brand-name businesses like Nokia, Intel, and General Electric were among the top 10 publicly traded companies by market cap. Today, just one of these top-10 companies from 2000 is still among the largest in the world (I'll get to this company a bit later).\n\nNo one has a crystal ball that can, with 100% accuracy, predict the future on Wall Street. But that doesn't stop investors from making educated guesses about the future, which is what I'm about to do now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThough technological innovations, mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs, and economic events can be extremely difficult to predict when looking years into the future, I believe the following five stocks will be the largest trillion-dollar companies by 2035 -- and artificial intelligence (AI) titan Nvidia, which may be in a mammoth bubble, won't be one of them!\n\n1. Amazon\n\nBy 2035, my expectation is that e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will comfortably be the largest publicly traded company in the U.S.\n\nThe fuel that should help Amazon capture the crown as Wall Street's top dog by market cap is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages of ramping, yet AWS already has $100 billion in annual run-rate sales and has captured a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend, as of the end of 2023, per Canalys. Cloud-service margins blow online retail sales margins out of the water. As AWS ramps, Amazon's operating cash flow can grow at a substantially faster pace than its total sales.\n\nAmazon's subscription services and advertising services segments should hold their own, too. The company surpassed 200 million Prime subscribers three years ago and has since added the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football and expanded its content library. The exceptional pricing power associated with Prime should meaningfully boost sales and cash flow from this segment.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon draws in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion people to its site each month, which equates to strong ad-pricing power.\n\nI fully expect Amazon's cash flow to send its valuation to north of $5 trillion over the next 11 years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nRemember the lone stock I alluded to earlier that's the only remnant from the 10 largest companies by market cap in 2000? It's software giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). I expect this cash cow of a company to retain its place in the top five over the coming decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's not-so-subtle secret to success has been its uncanny ability to blend the old with the new. For example, Windows may not be growth segment it was 25 years ago, but it remains the undisputed top global operating system by market share. Microsoft continues to generate boatloads of cash flow from legacy segments like Windows and Office and utilizes this cash to reinvest in higher-growth initiatives and acquisitions.\n\nNothing has been more important this decade to Microsoft than its cloud-service ties. Azure is the No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform behind AWS, with constant-currency sales growth pacing around 30% in recent quarters. The enterprise integration of cloud-related services among its multiple suites of products can sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft is swimming in cash. It closed out March with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated a jaw-dropping $110 billon in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. Microsoft has more than enough capital coming in to take chances on acquisitions and game-changing innovations.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nThe third-largest trillion-dollar stock by 2035, based on my prognostication, will be Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and global No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud.\n\nTime is certainly something that's going to work in Alphabet's favor. For the last nine years, Google has accounted for no less than 90% of global monthly internet search share. With Google unlikely to cede its monopoly like share of search, this should allow Alphabet's ad-driven operations to benefit from lengthy periods of economic expansion. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, there hasn't been one that's lasted longer than 18 months since the end of World War II.\n\nLike Amazon and Microsoft, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud is going to play a key role in Alphabet's success. Google Cloud finished up its first profitable year in 2023 and should have no trouble scaling its sales, profits, and operating margin in the years to come as businesses increase their cloud-based information technology spending.\n\nAlphabet also boasts a healthy balance sheet, with nearly $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as of March 31. It can make acquisitions or organically invest in game-changing projects without adversely impacting its bottom line or foundational operating segments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nThe company ranked fourth on my list of trillion-dollar stocks by 2035 is social media colossus Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta is the parent company behind the following ultra-popular social sites: Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Mesenger, and Threads.\n\nSimilar to Alphabet, Meta should be one of the prime beneficiaries of sustained periods of economic growth for the U.S. and global economy. Meta generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, and businesses tend to be looser with their marketing budgets when the U.S. and global economy are firing on all cylinders. With Meta's social media \"real estate\" attracting 3.24 billion daily active users in the March-ended quarter, advertisers understand they're not going to reach more eyeballs on any other platform.\n\nMeta Platforms can also benefit from its longtail growth opportunity in virtual/augmented reality, the metaverse, and AI. While Meta's Reality Labs segment is expected to be a money drain for the next couple of years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a knack for building up platforms and opening the flood gates for monetization when they're good and ready (and not before).\n\nTo somewhat keep with the theme, Meta Platforms' balance sheet gives it the luxury of making these investments in its future. Meta closed out March with $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and is pacing $77 billion in net cash generated from its operations on an annual run-rate basis.\n\n5. Visa\n\nThe fifth largest trillion-dollar stock by 2035 won't be Nvidia, which I expect will be the victim of an AI bubble-bursting event, or Apple, whose growth engine has completely stalled over the last two years. Rather, it'll be the world's leading payment processor, Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nJust as ad-driven platforms Alphabet and Meta benefit from lengthy periods of economic growth, Visa enjoys the fruits of higher enterprise and consumer spending. Since World War II ended, most economic expansions have endured multiple years, with two periods of growth surpassing the decade mark. Payment processors absolutely thrive during these expansions.\n\nWhat gives Visa a pathway to become one of the five-largest publicly traded companies by 2035 is its addressable opportunity. In addition to being the clear-cut No. 1 in market share by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the top global market for consumption), Visa has a multidecade runway in numerous emerging markets where consumers and businesses remain largely underbanked (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia). Cross-border volume has consistently grown by double-digits, which speaks to this still untapped international opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, Visa's management team has avoided the temptation of becoming a lender. Strictly focusing on payment facilitation has allowed Visa to sidestep the credit delinquencies and loan losses that arise during economic downturns and derail lending institutions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Five Broad Technology ETFs To Keep On Your Radar In 2024",
        "content": "Major U.S. indices are coming off a strong performance quarter following surging gains of large-cap technology stocks fueling the bull market. Despite the slight drawback in recent weeks, Wall Street analysts are positive that there’s still enough steam left in the engines before indices could experience a retraction.\n\nTech Holding Steady\n\nOn Monday, May 20 indices across the market were pursuing new records as the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.65%, reaching an intra-day record high of 16,794.87. The broader S&P 500 furthered its winning streak, gaining 0.09% and ending the trading day at 5,309.13.\n\nOn Wall Street, all eyes were on the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had caught investors off guard following its breakout performance on Friday, May 17. The Dow ended the trading day above 40,000, a new record for the 30-stock index and the first time in its nearly 128-year history.\n\nAfter the weekend, however, the Dow Jones slightly retreated, falling 196.82 points on May 20, and closing off at 39,806.77.\n\nThough retraction levels are somewhat superficial at this time, investors are hot on the heels of large-cap technology stocks and companies that are expected to begin delivering earnings results in the following weeks.\n\nThe next couple of weeks are set to be yet another eventful time on the stock market as major players such as AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are expected to deliver earnings. Company stocks gained 2% on May 20, as investors and analysts raised their pricing positions ahead of its earnings report.\n\nNvidia continues to push beyond the glass ceiling, with stocks up more than 96% since the turn of the year and already gaining more than 206% in the last 12 months. The tech and chip titan is now the third-largest on the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion.\n\nThough elsewhere, broader economic performance continues to remain volatile despite U.S. inflation trending downwards and domestic demand for products and services cools. Inflation data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in April with CPI rising 3.4% year on year, Reuters reported.\n\nSticky inflation and wage growth have left the Federal Reserve’s decision unchanged about cutting interest rates any time soon, with the federal fund rate still sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%. A potential rate cut is expected near the end of summer, as the central bank continues to gauge inflation, employment, and wage growth as key decision-makers before losing their monetary policy. 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nNew York Wall Street sign.\n\nLooking Towards Diversifying\n\nThe overactive market conditions are bringing new and old investors to consider other possibilities that could provide them with broader diversification in the tech sector. As the competition among large-cap companies continues to swell, those looking to hold a safer position could instead be looking at tech exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an opportunity to gain market share and further diversify their holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroad tech ETFs are a corner of the market that has received major attention in recent years, with holdings in companies that are directly involved in the technology industry, including networking, software, hardware, semiconductors, social media, search engine marketing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nHere’s a breakdown of five broad tech ETFs to keep on your radar this year.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF\n\n5G connectivity is taking off at full speed despite being only in the beginning stages of its lifecycle. An Ericsson Mobility Report found that more than 1.6 billion 5G smartphone subscriptions were active by the end of 2023 with a projected two billion to be active by the end of this year.\n\nThe exceptional growth of the market has meant that mobile service providers are quickly catching wind of these developments and looking to leverage larger market opportunities in the coming years.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG) shows that 5G technology and connectivity aren’t only essential for everyday communication but instead provide a stable investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their portfolios into this seemingly untapped market.\n\nThe fund has roughly 53 holdings, offering investors transparent exposure to 5G stocks and companies engaged in connectivity services, development, research, and commercialization. The underlying index tracks 48 globally-listed stocks with various market capitalizations.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, the fund has held steady, offering a 21.68% one-year return, and roughly 9.15% since inception. Total return (NAV) is slightly in line with broader market performance, with year-to-date returns of 2.77%, as of May 2024.\n\nA diverse fund holding ensures that investors obtain the necessary exposure to large-cap technology and network stocks, with iPhone maker, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) having the top spot, with 5.67% of the fund invested in Apple shares.\n\nOther notable holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO).\n\nThe Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF is more than a fund directed at network mobility. Instead, Defiance claims that this fund allows investors to gain traction in a rapidly growing industry that’s connected to more than mobile devices, but instead sees some of its biggest customers being in healthcare, finance, and data generation.\n\niShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM) is a broad technology fund with roughly 278 holdings in North American equities. The objective of the fund is to provide investors with more diversified exposure to North American equities and companies operating in the technology sector, including communication services and the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nOn top of this, the fund manages several holdings related to hardware, software, internet marketing, and interactive media. Overall, the Expanded Tech Sector ETF aims to provide North American and international investors with an expressed view of advanced technology companies and the broader tech sector.\n\nBased on current performance data, the iShares Extended Tech Sector ETF has gained roughly 10.59 since its inception back in 2001. One year total return is currently standing at 52.97%, which for some investors might seem outlandish considering the fund's broad exposure to various capital sectors.\n\nThe staggering performance of the fund can be largely attributed to its ability to invest in a large quantity of diverse tech and software companies. At the top of the list, companies such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) make up the largest portion of fund distributions.\n\nOutside of investing in major tech companies, most of which are part of the Magnificent Seven, the fund has much of its distributions held up in the semiconductor and interactive media services, investing 24.0% and 19.31% of the fund, respectively. Other sectors of importance include application and system software, and lesser-known services such as IT consulting and communication equipment.\n\nSince the turn of the year, the fund has gained 17.73%, while the broader S&P 500 has risen 11.29% YTD, and the S&P 500 Information Technology index is up by 16.24% YTD.\n\nRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\n\nAnother suitable option for investors looking to invest in large-cap high-tech companies is the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) which invests in the top 7 tech stocks and provides investors with more exposure to heavy-weight competitors.\n\nFor investors that are not yet aware, the Magnificent Seven is the collective name given to the largest, and most prominent tech companies and includes Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nIn the last couple of years, these seven trailblazing companies have helped push technology stocks to new heights, and the widespread development of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fuel the next generation of tech and software developers.\n\nMAGS offers investors pure exposure to the Magnificent Seven companies, reducing direct volatile risk exposure and weighting out portfolio distribution. On average, distribution holdings are fairly equal, although currently 16.36% is invested in Alphabet Class A shares, with Meta Platforms taking the bottom position with 12.61% fund allocation.\n\nThough the fund offers direct pure exposure to mega-cap tech stocks, seasoned professionals might be skeptical about the long-term viability of MAGS. For starters, the fund is relatively new, coming onto the market in November 2023, meaning that many investors still have limited amounts of data to clearly define their forward-looking position of the fund.\n\nSecondly, the fund solely holds seven stocks, meaning that risk distribution to return potential is seemingly higher, and can be considered a drawback for older, more seasoned investors that are looking to lower these risks and direct capital towards more buoyant long-term options.\n\nFinally, a principal investment strategy of MAGS is to invest at least 80% of its assets, including borrowings for investment purposes in the financial instruments of its holdings that provide the best exposure, or a combination of economic characteristics.\n\nThis could mean that should one of its holdings, or several others experience a significant decline in revenue, profit, market share, or market capitalization, the fund could then possibly experience declined near-term returns.\n\nThough it’s an ambitious technology fund that gives the best possible exposure to the Magnificent Seven, perhaps investors who are looking to reduce risks and mitigate near-term volatility would be best suited to opt for something more geared towards their forward-looking goals.\n\nVanEck Robotics ETF\n\nOn paper, the VanECK Robotics ETF (IBOT) offers a multi-dynamic investment opportunity that sees the fund invest in large-scale technological projects and developments supported by global market demand.\n\nIBOT exposure is directed toward high-growth companies, the majority focusing on future industrial automation and technological acceleration. Based on current data, IBOT invests the majority of its capital in the information technology sector, followed by industrial and consumer discretionary. Other, smaller holdings are focused on healthcare, energy, and cash.\n\nThe fund aims to replicate the performance of the BlueState Robotics Index which tracks companies that are closely involved in the field of robotics research and development.\n\nOverall, the BlueStar Robotics Index has held steady performance, with the index rising 23.45% over the past 12 months. The BlueStar Robotics Index has distributions across the world, investing in highly developed and high-growth capital markets, including the U.S., Japan, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, among other countries.\n\nSince its inception back in April 2023, the VanEck robotics fund has gained roughly 21.39%, slightly below the 22.16% return reported by the BlueStar Robotics Index during the same period. However, a yearly return is currently reported at 22.17%, which could give a positive indication for investors looking to actively leverage the robotics industry.\n\nIn a report by the International Federation of Robotics, recent data showed that in 2023, manufacturing companies across the world, and primarily in the U.S. have heavily invested in production line and supply chain automation. During the period, robotic installations rose by 12%, reaching more than 44,300 units in 2023, with the automotive industry being the top adopter of automation and robotic equipment.\n\nOn the back of surging growth and demand, IBOT could be the link investors need to tap into the marketing of automation and robotic equipment. With both the private and public sectors now plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into the world of robotics automation, IBOT could perhaps be the turning point for novice and seasoned investors.\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nLast on the list is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) which aims to track the performance of a benchmark index through passively managed strategies, including a full-replication strategy when possible.\n\nAs the name suggests, VGT is focused on investment movement within the information technology sector with 27.60% of its weighted exposure allocated to the semiconductor sector. The systems software sector follows second, making up 22.90% of the fund, and technology hardware, storage, and peripherals take up 17.30%.\n\nAlthough these are only three of the primary sectors the fund is invested in, holdings such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Cisco Systems, and Accenture (NYSE: ACN) are among the 313 other companies that make up the broader diversification of VGT.\n\nFor the physical year-end 31 August 2023, Vanguard Information Technology ETF reported a strong turnover rate of 15.4%, while the fund currently has an earnings growth rate of 2.07%, according to recent fund information.\n\nOther performance data indicates that VGT managed to slightly outperform the benchmark one-year performance rate. VGT reported a 12-month return of 29.70%, while the benchmark return was 29.66%.\n\nFor investors who are seeking more weighted security and direct exposure to the domestic information technology sector, VGT is considered a reasonably safer option for long-term opportunities and provides a seemingly secure holdings distribution.\n\nRiding Out Uncertainty\n\nAs the bull run is expected to extend well into the coming months, looking toward the technology sector for better portfolio and performance buoyancy is becoming a sure strategic decision for investors and Wall Street investment firms.\n\nAlthough uncertainty continues to loom overhead, with geopolitical tension and tight interest rates keeping some investors at bay, those seeking to leverage current market conditions are holding steady on technology stocks and ETFs due to a positive turnaround in the market.\n\nArguably, conditions are looking surprisingly positive for both ends of the spectrum. The S&P 500 Information Technology index is above the broader S&P 500, gaining 16.24% compared to 11.29% year to date. On a quarterly basis, similar conditions are playing out, as the S&P tech sector index gained 3.34% compared to 1.02% on the S&P.\n\nMarket conditions are piping hot, and investors aren’t taking a backseat anytime soon. Yet, broader economic conditions and the possibility of a hard landing remain deciding factors for some seasoned investors who are hoping to ride out near-term volatility.\n\nFinishing Thoughts\n\nTechnology is rapidly changing the way we work and communicate, and the companies spearheading the race to innovation are casting a bright light on new opportunities on the stock market.\n\nThough there is still a lot of uncertainty up ahead, both in relation to macroeconomic conditions and the global political environment, investors should consider seeking out investments, and diverse funds that not only provide stability but offer them the necessary long and near-term broad exposure in advanced tech sectors that can ride out uncertainty,m while providing sufficient portfolio buoyancy.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: I recently initiated a small position in Tesla, no other positions in any other positions mentioned.\n\nRelated Content\n\n10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now Should You Hold Nvidia (NVDA)?

        "title": "Virtual Victors: The Top 3 Stocks That Will Dominate the Metaverse Landscape",
        "content": "On Wall Street, reality may blur with the virtual, while investors search for top metaverse stocks.\n\nThe metaverse refers to a virtual world where users can interact, play and socialize in an immersive and interactive environment. With the rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, the metaverse is poised to revolutionize the way we live, work and play. The segment is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 41%.\n\nAs the metaverse continues to evolve, investors are seeking exposure to the companies driving this innovation with cutting-edge technologies, platforms and experiences. From gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare, the metaverse has the potential to transform industries and create new growth opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let’s delve into three top metaverse stocks to buy that are paving the way for a new era of immersive digital engagement.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is a leading innovator in haptics technology, which allows users to experience realistic touch sensations through digital devices. IMMR develops haptic feedback solutions across various industries. Those include mobile phones, automotive user interfaces and gaming peripherals. Their comprehensive portfolio enables manufacturers to integrate immersive touch feedback into their products.\n\nThe haptics technology innovator reported stellar financial results for the first quarter in April. Total revenue soared to $43.8 million, a dramatic 520% year-over-year (YOY) increase from $7.1 million. This robust performance significantly surpassed analyst estimates of $24.94 million. Net income climbed to $19.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $9.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nImmersion inked significant licensing deals in the first quarter of 2024, solidifying its market position. A February agreement granted Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) access to Immersion’s haptics patents for their hardware, software, VR, and gaming products. This deal highlighted the growing role of haptics in the metaverse. Additionally, Immersion renewed its licensing agreement with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) in March, ensuring continued use of their technology in Nintendo’s gaming products.\n\nAs a result, IMMR stock has gained 38% year-to-date (YTD), reaching multi-year highs. Shares are trading at an attractive 8.2x forward earnings and 4.4x sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $10.50 for IMMR, signaling roughly a 10% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is a real-time 3D development platform where creators can build interactive experiences. In fact, Unity’s reach extends far beyond video games. It allows a diverse set of creators to develop VR applications, architectural visualizations and automotive design simulations as well.\n\nYet, the 3D platform developer recently reported mixed financial results. Total revenues declined 8% YOY to $460.4 million, yet beat analyst estimates by 6%. Diluted net loss per share widened 12% to came in at 75 cents, higher than anticipated.\n\nIn a move poised to revolutionize the in-cabin car experience, Unity and Mazda Motor (OTCMKTS:MZDAY) have recently forged a strategic partnership. This collaboration will leverage Unity’s development platform to create a next-generation human-machine interface (HMI) and graphic user interface (GUI) for future Mazda vehicles.\n\nSo far in 2024, U stock has plunged close to 50%, while the stock is currently trading at 3.7 times sales. Yet, Wall Street remains optimistic for the prospects of U stock with a price forecast of $26, an upside of 25%. Interested investors could regard declines below $19 as opportunity to initiate positions in U shares.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nThe last top metaverse stock is the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pure-play for investing in businesses at the forefront of the metaverse market. These companies might be involved in hardware (VR headsets, haptic technology) and software development (game engines, 3D creation tools). In addition, networking infrastructure and even payment solutions that will facilitate transactions within virtual worlds enter the domain of the fund.\n\nMETV, which has 38 holdings, was launched in June 2021. The top 10 names make up about 50% of net assets of $406 million. In terms of sectors, we see gaming platform (22%) followed by computing components (19%), cloud solutions (14.9%) and video games (11.6%). About 70% of the companies are U.S.-based. Others come from China (8.7%), Japan (6.7%), South Korea (6.0%) and others. Leading holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); Roblox (NYSE:ROBLOX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nSince January, METV has returned around 10%, and recently hit a 2-year high. Yet, the current valuation appears favorable with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1x . Investors looking to capitalize on the next iteration of the internet can find the METV ETF a compelling option. Finally, potential investors should also note the expense ratio of 0.59%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Meta Removes AI-Generated Influence Campaigns in China, Israel",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. removed hundreds of Facebook accounts associated with covert influence campaigns from China, Israel, Iran, Russia and other countries, some of which used artificial intelligence tools to generate disinformation, according to the company’s quarterly threat report.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers Wall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century\n\nMeta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has seen threat actors rely on AI to produce fake images, videos and text in an effort to influence users on its sites. But the use of generative AI didn’t affect the company’s ability to disrupt those networks, Meta said Wednesday in the report.\n\nAmong the disinformation campaigns, the company found a deceptive network from China sharing AI-generated poster images of a fictitious pro-Sikh movement, and an Israel-based network posting AI-generated comments praising Israel’s military under the pages of media organizations and public figures. The company said it removed many of those networks before they were able to build audiences among authentic communities.\n\n“Right now we’re not seeing gen AI being used in terribly sophisticated ways,” Meta’s policy director of threat disruption, David Agranovich, said Tuesday during a press briefing. Tactics such as creating AI-generated profile photos or using artificial intelligence to produce large volumes of spammy content, haven’t been effective so far, he said.\n\n“But we know that these networks are inherently adversarial,” Agranovich said. “They’re going to keep evolving their tactics as their technology changes.”\n\nSocial media companies such as Facebook, ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Elon Musk’s X have struggled with the influx of fake and misleading AI-generated content on their sites. This year alone, doctored audio of US President Joe Biden and fake images of the Israel-Hamas conflict circulated on social media, gathering millions of views.\n\nNick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, has been vocal about the need to detect and label AI-generated content, especially as the company prepares for the 2024 election cycle. Global elections will take place in more than 30 countries this year, including many places where the company’s apps are widely used, such as the US, India and Brazil.\n\nClegg has said that creating an industry standard around watermarking is the “most urgent task facing us today.” Meta has been working on the ability to detect and label images that were created by tools from AI companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and OpenAI. The company has already starting adding visible markers to some images as well as invisible markers and identifying information in image files.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta recently updated its policies to label misleading content on its site that is AI-generated, rather than remove it. The company also requires advertisers to disclose when they use AI to create Facebook or Instagram ads related to social issues, elections or politics, but the company doesn’t fact-check political ads by politicians.\n\n(Updates with image detection in the eighth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Elon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth Who Is Most Likely to Succeed at Elon High?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Retirement Stocks to Buy: 7 Picks Offering Value, Growth and Dividends",
        "content": "Finding the best retirement stocks that perfectly align with every investor’s portfolio is challenging. Numerous factors influence the decision tree, including your retirement account’s tax structure, age, risk tolerance and personal investment preferences. Nonetheless, a robust retirement plan usually involves diversification across multiple industries, offering exposure to a broad array of investments. It’s never too early to start considering retirement investing; starting yesterday is best, but the second best time is now.\n\nWhen refining their retirement stock selections, investors should focus on companies with a proven track record of performance, potential for future growth and investor-friendly financial metrics. Dividends are particularly important for those nearing retirement, as they provide a steady income stream within their accounts. Conversely, younger investors can leverage dividends to increase their holdings through reinvestment automatically.\n\nWhile many investors may tweak their retirement portfolios to decrease risk as they near retirement, three stocks currently stand out as excellent candidates for an immediate buy-and-hold strategy. Incorporating these retirement stocks into your portfolio now could significantly reduce the need for future adjustments as you approach your golden years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nValley National Bancorp (VLY) retirement stocks: a roadsign that says \"retirement ahead\". retirement stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you’re looking for retirement stocks, an affordable bank stock operating in the emergent cannabis industry that’s undervalued and gives investors a 6.37% total yield sounds like a dream come true. In the short term, Federal Reserve rate cuts gradually take effect, and smaller regional banks like Valley National Bancorp (NYSE:VLY) might experience relief from oppressive borrowing rates and reduced consumer loan interest.\n\nValley National stands out as an attractively priced regional bank, trading at just 0.6x book value and 7.75x earnings, making it both undervalued and often overlooked. The bank boasts a strong balance sheet and a low debt-to-equity ratio of only 0.56, compared to the industry average of 1.2, underscoring its minimal leverage relative to its peers. Its recent stock buyback initiative and a 6.37% total yield also underscore its financial stability.\n\nAnalysts largely view Valley National as undervalued, with an average price target of $9.44 — about 31% above its current share price. Sentiment around the bank’s stock is improving, with 44% of analysts now recommending a “hold” on Valley National, a significant improvement with 300% greater positive sentiment than the previous polling period.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarkel Group (MKL) Markel website homepage MRK stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, insurance company Markel Group (NYSE:MKL) is among one of today’s top retirement stocks, but not due to its inherent industry strength — instead, buying Markel Group today may be like buying a slightly riskier Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) in the 1980s when the Class A shares traded at “just” $1,200 per share. Of course, a $1,200 investment exploded by more than 47,000% today, and Markel Group may be on a similar trajectory.\n\nThe company bucks insurance agency tradition by leveraging its vast cash sums, some of which is their “float,” or paid insurance premiums that are investable, into solid but somewhat speculative investments. It’s essentially the same model Warren Buffett used at Berkshire’s outset to great success. Markel Group’s specific holdings include Berkshire (of course) and a range of both tech-centric and value offerings like Meta (NASDAQ:META), on one hand, and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), on the other. In addition to a range of public and private investments, Markel also owns a slew of insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries that credit rating agencies consistently assess as investment-grade and keep plenty of cash coming in to fuel Markel’s long-term, strategic investment selection.\n\nSharkninja (SN) a retired couple sits on a bench at the beach\n\nRetirement Goals\n\nIncorporating a consumer discretionary stock, especially from an appliance manufacturer, into your retirement stocks portfolio might not seem like the wisest decision due to the sector’s relative volatility in uncertain economic conditions. However, Sharkninja (NYSE:SN) consistently defies this trend, having achieved a 20% compounded annual growth rate in sales since 2008, despite various challenging market environments.\n\nHaving gone public just last summer, Sharkninja’s shares have already delivered a 77% return to early investors, outperforming the S&P 500’s return threefold over the same period. There is little sign of this momentum waning anytime soon. The company’s most recent quarterly report shows a 25% spike in sales, a standout achievement, particularly when compared to the significant sales declines at major retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT). With its strong position in the consumer market and diverse product lineup, Sharkninja is a compelling choice for inclusion in retirement stocks today.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest blended tech player on this list of retirement stocks for its stability, modest yield and forward-looking strategy. In contrast to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft offers both institutional and individual investors smart money management, substantial long-term growth potential, and forward-thinking management that continues to drive innovation, regardless of the company’s large size.\n\nMicrosoft’s strategic investment in AI is poised to benefit the company significantly. Even if you’re skeptical of some of the more ambitious AI claims, it’s evident that AI is disrupting legacy search engines and providing new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft’s existing software suite. Microsoft’s partnership with leading AI firm OpenAI positions it at the forefront of major technological advancements.\n\nWe are in a situation reminiscent of the early 2000s, when the potential of search engine technology was just beginning to unfold, and its future profitability was not yet fully understood. No public company is as well-aligned with that future potential as Microsoft, making it a standout choice that aligns well with nearly every prudent investment strategy.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) stands out as a dominant force among retirement stocks, masterfully blending innovative technology, robotics and the expanding global healthcare market alongside a small buyback-based yield. A crucial component of both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is a trusted provider of high-end, specialized medical equipment renowned for its stability and reliability.\n\nSetting itself apart from competitors focusing on conventional medical hardware, Intuitive Surgical has revolutionized the surgery field to improve provider efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nThe company aggressively expands its global presence as the healthcare industry rebounds post-pandemic. The latest quarterly report showcased a significant 16% year-over-year increase in the global usage of its flagship robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, with a steady installation rate (312 units in Q1, 2023 and 313 this year).\n\nAlongside this progress, an 11% sales growth and a net income increase to $545 million from $355 million underscore Intuitive Surgical’s status as one of the top stocks to invest in today.\n\nKeep an eye on Intuitive Surgical as it prepares to launch its next-generation da Vinci platform this year. CEO Gary Guthart has indicated that this new model will feature “10,000 times the processing power” of current models, dramatically improving data analysis, sensing technology, and digital and analytical functions.\n\nDeere & Co (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) is one of my top picks for retirement stocks as it seamlessly blends innovative growth, especially in robotics and automation, with solid income at an 8.4% total yield. While robotics and automation are trending topics, Deere often goes underappreciated in a market that typically favors startups and niche companies. This oversight may reverse as Deere reveals the full scope of its robotics capabilities, potentially positioning it as a leading robotics stock globally.\n\nDeere’s premier innovations include fully autonomous tractors and tillage machines that utilize advanced mapping and sensing technology. This technology significantly saves agricultural producers time and energy during field preparation and harvesting.\n\nCurrently, Deere’s autonomous tractors demonstrate clear and viable operational prospects. However, the potential for significant revenue through licensing agreements for its newly developed technologies could be substantial. For instance, self-driving car companies might license parts of Deere’s neural network sensing mechanisms to assess terrain safety, or drone delivery startups could use Deere’s mapping tools to develop urban delivery networks.\n\nAcuity Brands (AYI) aculty signage (AYI) stocks to buy\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoring but with a bright future — that describes Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI), a lighting company offering surprising expansion and a 2.95% total yield. Acuity is one of the world’s largest lighting companies and provides a diverse range of products, from bathroom fixtures aimed at DIY home improvers to extensive streetlights designed for municipalities. Acuity has expanded its market presence dramatically over the past 20 years by actively acquiring smaller companies.\n\nSince 2010, Acuity has maintained a nearly 10% compounded annual earnings growth rate, a robust endorsement of the company’s performance amid market fluctuations. The company continues to build on this strong track record, as CEO Neil Ashe highlighted in the first-quarter call: “We increased our adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated significant free cash flow, and we allocated capital effectively to drive value.” Despite market instability, Acuity Brands appears resilient and well-positioned for continued growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in the Markel Group.

        "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta said on Wednesday it had found \"likely AI-generated\" content used deceptively on its Facebook and Instagram platforms, including comments praising Israel's handling of the war in Gaza published below posts from global news organizations and U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe social media company, in a quarterly security report, said the accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and other concerned citizens, targeting audiences in the United States and Canada. It attributed the campaign to Tel Aviv-based political marketing firm STOIC.\n\nSTOIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nWhile Meta has found basic profile photos generated by artificial intelligence in influence operations since 2019, the report is the first to disclose the use of text-based generative AI technology since it emerged in late 2022.\n\nResearchers have fretted that generative AI, which can quickly and cheaply produce human-like text, imagery and audio, could lead to more effective disinformation campaigns and sway elections.\n\nIn a press call, Meta security executives said they removed the Israeli campaign early and did not think novel AI technologies had impeded their ability to disrupt influence networks, which are coordinated attempts to push messages.\n\nExecutives said they had not seen such networks deploying AI-generated imagery of politicians realistic enough to be confused for authentic photos.\n\nKEY QUOTE\n\n\"There are several examples across these networks of how they use likely generative AI tooling to create content. Perhaps it gives them the ability to do that quicker or to do that with more volume. But it hasn't really impacted our ability to detect them,\" said Meta head of threat investigations Mike Dvilyanski.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nThe report highlighted six covert influence operations that Meta disrupted in the first quarter.\n\nIn addition to the STOIC network, Meta shut down an Iran-based network focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict, although it did not identify any use of generative AI in that campaign.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nMeta and other tech giants have grappled with how to address potential misuse of new AI technologies, especially in elections.\n\nResearchers have found examples of image generators from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft producing photos with voting-related disinformation, despite those companies having policies against such content.\n\nThe companies have emphasized digital labeling systems to mark AI-generated content at the time of its creation, although the tools do not work on text and researchers have doubts about their effectiveness.\n\nStory continues\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nMeta faces key tests of its defenses with elections in the European Union in early June and in the United States in November. (This story has been corrected to reflect that this is the first disclosure of text-based generative AI use, not of generative AI use altogether, in paragraph 4)\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Buffett’s Secret Stash? The Top 3 Holdings in Berkshire’s Little-Known Subsidiary",
        "content": "Everyone is familiar with Warren Buffett’s track record at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B). Since he became CEO, he has generated returns of 4.38 million percent for investors, a compounded annual growth rate of 19.8%. That’s almost exactly double the returns of the S&P 500. If you really want to reap the rewards, grab some Berkshire subsidiary stocks.\n\nWhat is only just becoming more noticed is Buffett’s hidden, less-known subsidiary that houses a separate investment portfolio. Acquired when he bought General Re in 1998, New England Asset Management (NEAM) has nearly $70 billion in assets under management (AUM). That includes an investment portfolio worth $645.5 million.\n\nSurprisingly, the biggest holdings in NEAM are actually exchange-traded funds (ETF). The SDPR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is the biggest holding with over 184,000 shares valued at $96.4 million or 15% of the portfolio’s total.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe second-biggest position is the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV). The 78,000 shares held are valued at $41.1 million or more than 6% of the total. Although it ranks ninth on the list, NEAM also owns over 21,000 shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) worth $10.1 million. That means nearly one-quarter of these Berkshire subsidiary stocks are invested in the broad market index.\n\nBefore we even get to an individual stock, the billionaire investor also owns an international stock ETF, a total market ETF, and an ETF showcasing high-yield dividend stocks. There are also preferred shares from several banks. A regular investor could learn a lot about building his own portfolio by looking at NEAM.\n\nHowever, we want to see the stocks owned by this Berkshire subsidiary. The three stocks below are its top stock holdings.\n\nTop Berkshire Subsidiary Stocks: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest individual stock position in New England Asset Management is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). It owns 64,375 shares valued at $12.9 million, which is good enough for 2% of the portfolio’s total, good for a seventh-place ranking overall.\n\nJPMorgan, of course, is the premier bank in the country and arguably the world. It is not just a leading investment and commercial banking center but also the largest credit card issuer and a top asset and wealth manager. It had nearly $4 trillion in AUM at the end of 2023.\n\nThe bank stock is up 17% in 2024 and 47% over the past year. Yet if investors are thinking of buying the stock to ride the wave, they may want to follow CEO Jamie Dimon’s advice. He told shareholders at the annual meeting, “I want to make it really clear, OK? We’re not going to buy back a lot of stock at these prices.” If Dimon thinks JPMorgan stock is expensive, who are you to argue?\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) A photo of the Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a gray building against a blue sky.\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the semiconductor stock best known for its mobile chipsets. Increasingly, though, it is becoming more immersed in artificial intelligence (AI). Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year offers the power to handle the complex processing task that AI demands on Android phones including Samsung‘s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China’s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nThe Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Gemini.\n\nAlso, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just announced a new series of personal computers running its Copilot AI chatbot that are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips. While some initial reviews are mixed — the chip excels at AI tasks, for instance, but lags in most other things — this is a launching pad for further integration.\n\nNew England Asset Management owns 58,996 shares valued at $10 million, good for a 1.6% share of the portfolio.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third largest stock holding in NEAM is NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), the maker of near-field communication (NFC) chips. It seems Buffett’s investment managers aren’t as reticent at investing in tech stocks as much as the Oracle himself. They own 39,635 shares of the company worth $9.8 million and represent 1.5% of NEAM’s portfolio.\n\nNXP is helping to develop the next generation of smart cars that use its chips to communicate with one another and with objects in the environment around them. The automotive segment makes up 58% of total revenue. Revenue, though, was down across the board for the chipmaker in the first quarter.\n\nThat hasn’t slowed NXP Semiconductors stock, which is up 22% this year and 63% higher over the last 12 months. The chipmaker has generated tremendous total returns for investors over the past decade of nearly 400%. In 2018 it started paying a dividend. Since then it has rewarded shareholders by growing it at an incredible 27% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nBecause automobiles are essentially rolling computers these days, look for NXP Semiconductors to play an increasingly important role in their development.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Must-Own Stocks to Hold for the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "Seven firms representing various industries stand out as prospective high-yielders as the market approaches H2 2024. Each one has distinct development drivers and value propositions. These stocks cover a wide range of prospects indicative of the changing market landscape, from semiconductor discoveries to AI development, medicinal breakthroughs, and worldwide consumer brands.\n\nBecause of its economical and effective processors, the first one is becoming increasingly popular in the data center and cloud computing sectors. The latter is growing internationally, improving user experiences across its platforms, and making major strides in AI. The third is seeing a rapid increase in profitability and revenue due to the growing demand for AI-powered PCs and an enterprise refresh cycle.\n\nThe fourth one provides stability with its substantial interest revenue from floating-rate loans and a deliberate move toward safer first-lien loans. With a varied pipeline in cancer and other therapeutic areas, the fifth one keeps innovating while guaranteeing consistent revenue growth. The sixth one employs strategic initiatives for global expansion in the face of setbacks. Lastly, the seventh shows strong revenue growth and rising user satisfaction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMust-Own Stocks: AMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite a historically weak first quarter (Q1 2024), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) boosted its share of server CPU revenue thanks to growing cloud deployments and business acceptance. Globally, about 900 public instances are using AMD processors. This is due to the expansion of fourth-generation EPYC processors applied by major cloud providers, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Hence, this widespread usage highlights AMD’s expanding market share in cloud computing.\n\nMoreover, strong demand for Ryzen 8000 series CPUs drove 85% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth for the Client division. Sales of Ryzen desktop CPUs increased by double digits compared to the previous year, while sales of Ryzen mobile CPUs almost doubled. The introduction of Ryzen Pro 8000 CPUs with AI capabilities and performance that lead the industry solidifies AMD’s leadership in the commercial PC market.\n\nFinally, with a 10% yearly rise to $1.7 billion in operating expenditures, AMD’s aggressive R&D and marketing spending to take advantage of AI growth potential is evident. Hence, this strategic investment is essential to continue innovation and keep a competitive edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Llama 3 model-poweredMeta (NASDAQ:META) AI marks a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, with its 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models being acknowledged as best-in-class. In addition, the 400+ billion parameter model’s continuous evolution is expected to establish industry standards.\n\nFurthermore, positive feedback has been received from tens of millions of people who have previously interacted with Meta AI. This early widespread acceptance is indicative of the AI’s efficacy and user-friendliness. Meta AI’s potential to produce real-time, high-quality pictures and animations greatly improves the user experience on several platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and more. Hence, these improvements raise engagement levels and draw in additional people.\n\nBy providing early copies of its products to a select group of users for feedback and further enhancements, Meta’s strategy guarantees that the final product will be improved before being made available to a larger audience. In the past, this approach has worked well for product launches. Therefore, the methodical extension of Meta AI into other languages and nations suggests a well-organized strategy to boost user base and engagement on a worldwide scale.\n\nMust-Own Stocks: Intel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has released positive Q1 earnings, with sales matching expectations and EPS above forecasts. Revenue for the first quarter increased by 9% YOY to $12.7 billion. Consequently, the business exceeded the forecast by 5 cents and produced a non-GAAP EPS of 18 cents, demonstrating that Intel’s methodical approach to cutting costs has the desired effect. Indeed, strong profitability and sound financial standing are reflected in higher-than-expected EPS, which is essential to finance the following expansion projects.\n\nAdditionally, Intel expects several important variables to support sequential sales growth throughout the year and into 2025. AI PCs (AIPCs) are gaining pace due to their enterprise renewal cycle. Since December 2023, over 5 million AI PCs have been shipped due to the release of Intel Core Ultra CPUs. By the end of 2024, Intel anticipates exceeding its previous prediction of 40 million AI PCs.\n\nOverall, these patterns show a strong market need for AI-driven solutions and new enterprise technologies, two crucial areas for Intel. Thus, they exceed expectations due to a rising market share and robust product acceptability.\n\nOaktree Specialty Lending (OCSL) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nOaktree Specialty Lending (NASDAQ:OCSL) announced a Net Investment Income (NII) of 56 cents per share (Q2 2024), less than the 57 cents per share recorded in the prior quarter. This minor decline indicates the company’s continued strong earnings. The timing of capital deployments and repayments over the quarter caused the marginal decline. This shows that timing variations may affect quarterly profits despite the high overall earnings power.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s strategic change toward first-lien loans dropped the weighted average portfolio spread by 0.10% throughout the quarter. On Sept. 30, 2022, first-lien investments comprised 71% of the portfolio; second-lien investments dropped from 16% to 5% by the same date. Lastly, although it may result in somewhat lower returns, this move to safer, first-lien loans is a risk mitigation approach that improves the portfolio’s credit quality.\n\nMust-Own Stocks: Pfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor Q1 2024, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) announced total revenues of $14.9 billion. Pfizer managed an 11% operating revenue gain, excluding COVID-related medications (Comirnaty and Paxlovid), despite a 19% YOY fall in demand for these products. The company’s non-COVID product portfolio demonstrates good underlying performance across various therapeutic areas, which drove this rise. Undoubtedly, this operational growth reflects Pfizer’s ability to shift its focus from its COVID-19 pandemic revenue drivers to other business areas. This indicates the company’s resiliency and smart reallocation of resources.\n\nMoreover, Pfizer’s cancer business showed noteworthy expansion, with oncology sales rising operationally YOY by 19%. Commercial solid execution and integration of Seagen’s products greatly supported this expansion. This rise is indicative of Pfizer’s compelling foray into the cancer sector. Here, it used both internal development and acquisitions to propel growth. Lastly, this tendency is further supported by the acceptance and high demand for novel medications like Padcev and the ongoing efficacy of well-established therapies like Xtandi.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) maintained its global development efforts in Q2 2024. Despite operational difficulties, the company added 364 net new locations to its total count of 38,951 worldwide. Notably, the U.S. and China remain important markets for the corporation, accounting for 61% of its global portfolio. Starbucks’ confidence in its long-term development prospects and dedication to seizing new market possibilities are evident in this planned expansion.\n\nAdditionally, Starbucks’ digital initiatives — such as Mobile Order & Pay (MOP) and the Starbucks app — keep boosting convenience and consumer engagement. Customers’ significant acceptance rate of MOP reflects that 31% of all transactions during the quarter were MOP transactions. In addition, Starbucks intends to make the Starbucks app available to all users in July to improve accessibility and encourage the acquisition and retention of consumers via digital channels.\n\nFinally, to lessen the strain on its margins, Starbucks focuses on achieving cost reductions and operational efficiency.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) EPS increased significantly, rising 27% on a non-GAAP basis YOY to $1.08 in Q1 2024. EPS would have climbed by around 20% even under the company’s previous non-GAAP methodology. This did not account for the impact of stock-based compensation. Furthermore, this substantial rise in earnings implies that PayPal’s business model is extremely successful and has the potential to yield significant returns for investors.\n\nMoreover, the number of monthly active accounts rose by 2% YOY to 220 million, demonstrating consistent user involvement with the platform. On a trailing 12-month basis, the number of transactions per active account climbed by 13% to 60, indicating a rise in user engagement and transaction volume.\n\nFinally, PayPal’s strategy priority is expanding its services for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and major organizations. Thus, programs like the PayPal Complete Payments platform, intended for SMBs, have gained traction, as 7% of SMB activity is currently being processed using this platform.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, META, INTC, OCSL, PFE, SBUX and PYPL.

The company’s recent flip to profitability and diversification into the commercial segment makes the stock a compelling growth prospect in 2024.\n\nIt is probably not the first time that you’ve heard about Palantir, and it likely won’t be the last. During the pandemic, the stock more than tripled after its IPO but later crashed leaving many investors holding the bag. However, a lot has changed since then, and Palantir’s true long-term potential is starting to be recognized.\n\nPalantir’s recent flip toward profitability in the 2023 fiscal year is just one of the positive catalysts it has going for it. However, its growing commercial revenues, showcased in its latest first-quarter earnings results, continue to show a lot of promise. Nearly all financial metrics including revenue growth, operating income and free cash flow are up substantially. With strong forward guidance for 2024, PLTR stock is one of the top Cathie Wood stocks to buy in May.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Coattails: 3 Stocks to Ride the AI Chipmaker’s Earnings Success",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just released what was arguably its best earnings report ever. Revenues and profitability both reached historical highs, and the company bested Wall Street’s expectations. That report showed that revenues grew by 18% in Q1, reaching $26 billion. This has lead investors to start eyeing other AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe blowout report from Nvidia should serve to pull the broader AI sector higher still. Nvidia dominates the sector but there is a massive opportunity for other firms. Let’s look at three of the more AI stocks to buy following Nvidia’s latest positive news.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the primary challenger to Nvidia in the race for artificial intelligence dominance. It’s a battle in which AMD has long been trailing. Honestly, that’s not likely to change soon. It’s clear that demand for Nvidia’s best chips is much greater than that for AMD best.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd that’s not a bad thing. AMD actually has a very comfortable position at the moment. it has established its chips as the lower priced alternative to those from Nvidia. The largest and most important chip buyers including companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have made no secret about it. They are willing to invest heavily in AMD chips despite their slightly lower performance specifications.\n\nIn other words, AMD is in the enviable position of receiving the positive benefits of enterprise frustration with Nvidia’s pricing strategies. It’s a pretty good place to be while simultaneously making efforts to best Nvidia’s AI chips.\n\nBeyond that, Nvidia doesn’t have enough supply to meet demand, offering AMD another opportunity to prove its chips.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock has been noted as a beneficiary of Nvidia’s bounce across headlines covering the financial world.\n\nThe memory chip provider recently forged a relationship with Nvidia that should set it up for a period of strong success. Micron Technology is one of the leading providers of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. Those are integral to artificial intelligence. It is a segment dominated by Korean firms SK Hynix and Samsung.\n\nFortunately for Micron Technology, it has forged a strong relationship with Nvidia due to its superior memory process. That has allowed the company to make significant headway as a competitor to the two Korean firms. Micron Technology’s opportunity looks to be strengthening following news that Samsung’s HBM chips are failing Nvidia’s tests.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Samsung refutes the claims, and Nvidia declined to comment, Sources say that Samsung has been trying to pass Nvidia’s tests since last year. Those same sources say that the most recent failure occurred in April and is just now coming to light.\n\nMicron Technology is in prime position as a result.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is bound to be both interesting and volatile in the wake of Nvidia’s blowout earnings report.\n\nBased on price movement, it’s clear that some traders were only interested in securing gains following the earnings print. Prices jumped up on the news and then receded as profit takers sold their positions.\n\nInvestors shouldn’t take that to mean that the opportunity in Super Micro Computer is over. Remember, Super Micro Computer sells servers heavily featuring Nvidia’s GPUs. The company’s shares have soared as companies of all sizes  have moved to deploy artificial intelligence at scale.\n\nThe latest news again proves that Nvidia continues to see extraordinarily high demand. That should translate to increased demand for the server packages that Super Micro Computer produces.\n\nDon’t be surprised that investors took profits off the table on the strong news. It’s understandable. However, also be aware that the data center opportunity is extraordinarily strong, especially given that it accounted for $22.6 billion of Nvidia’s $26 billion in sales during the first quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In today’s market, anyone can look smart saying that stocks like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Meta (NASDAQ:META) are good investments. However, the best investments are often found by investors identifying overlooked stocks that the rest of the market has yet to catch up on. If you can enter these stocks at the right time, the returns have the potential to be life-changing over a long enough period. Imagine entering NVIDIA before it was a billion-dollar company!\n\nSo how can we identify these overlooked stocks ready to take the next step? Well, the best way is proper due diligence and research for fundamental catalysts like an industry-changing product, or stellar year-over-year financial growth. In this article, we’ll highlight three such overlooked stocks that are still flying under the radar for most investors.\n\nDespegar.com (DESP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you are from the States, there’s no need to be embarrassed if you have never heard of this company. Despegar.com (NYSE:DESP) is a leading Latin American online travel technology brand. As of now, six analysts have given DESP a projected one-year average price target of $14.42 and a high-end target of $19.00.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespegar.com offers a unique opportunity to invest in a regional travel industry flattened by the pandemic. It offers the largest selection of regional airlines and accommodations through an award-winning mobile or desktop app. Through its acquisition of Koin, Despegar has since entered the buy-now-pay-later market and is expected to continue growing its addressable market into entirely new customers. \r\n\r\nIn the most recent quarter, Despegar saw strong profitability and beat consensus earnings estimates by 120%. However, while DESP is trading a minimal price multiple at just 1.6x sales, some investors might worry about larger fish entering the waters. While other incredible Latin American stocks like MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) are already eyeing DESP for a potential acquisition, we see DESP’s current rise into the limelight as a great opportunity for investors to diversify into a relatively cheap local industry leader.\n\nPinDuoDuo (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinDuoDuo (NASDAQ:PDD) is usually not the first Chinese tech stock investors think of. It has often been overshadowed by stocks like AliBaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY). Wall Street analysts are well aware of the potential for PDD as they have an average price target of $201.09 with a street-high price target of $276.72. The high-end price target indicates more than 70% upside from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis company exploded during the pandemic with its agricultural eCommerce platform that connected farmers directly with consumers in China. Now, PinDuoDuo has launched its discount marketplace Temu in more than 50 markets worldwide. The result? PinDuoDuo reported a 130% year-over-year rise in revenue and 245% year-over-year growth in net income during the first quarter of 2024. Earnings-per-share jumped by 99% from the same quarter in 2023.\n\nPinDuoDuo has always traded with a China discount. Shares are trading at just 13x forward earnings and 5.5x sales. On a price multiple basis, the stock is cheaper now at a $218 billion market cap than when it had a $100 billion market cap. At this rate, don’t be surprised if five or ten years from now, PinDuoDuo is the best-performing Chinese ADR stock on the market!\n\nOnOn Holdings (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe complete our list of three overlooked stocks with our third international company: OnOn Holdings (NASDAQ:ONON). In May, 16 of 21 analysts rated the stock a Buy or Strong Buy. They also have an average one-year price target of $39.66, with the highest target being $54.51.\n\nOnOn has taken the running apparel and footwear world by storm. You might not recognize the brand by name, which goes by On Cloud, but you have likely seen the unique-looking shoe styles. Earnings in the most recent quarter beat estimates by 128% and On saw a 105% year-over-year growth in quarterly net income. One of the biggest growth drivers behind this performance has been ONON’s commitment to growing its number of high-profile investors and athletes including Roger Federer as a core marketing strategy.\n\nThe company is in high-growth mode right now and trades at a fairly high multiple. Shares trade at 42.7x forward earnings and 12.6x sales. With ONON expected to ramp up marketing again this summer and into the next Olympic games, investors should look out for key pullbacks for the chance to buy into this amazing growth trajectory.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy With $1,000 and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Buying stocks that can raise their dividends year after year is a great way to build a portfolio. Not only will you receive a growing stream of income, but dividend growth stocks also historically outperform the S&P 500. Dividend growers and initiators produced annual total returns of 10.2% from 1973 to 2023, according to research from Hartford Funds. By comparison, the average stock in the S&P 500 returned just 7.7% per year in that period.\n\nIf you can find a great dividend growth stock trading at a fair price, you can hold it for decades and see the yield on your original investment compound with each annual increase. So even if you're starting with just $1,000, you could end up with hundreds in annual dividends down the line. Here are three great candidates for your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Visa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) is the leading payment network in the world. Whenever you swipe a credit or debit card with the Visa logo on it, the company collects a small percentage of your payment. That's the fee it takes to ensure payment moves from your bank or credit account to the merchant's bank account.\n\nImportantly, Visa is not a bank itself. It doesn't offer credit to consumers and it doesn't hold deposits. It simply partners with banks that want to issue a credit card. And they choose Visa because it works with more merchants than any other payment network.\n\nSo Visa's business relies entirely on increasing payment volume and winning more customers. And while it's already a massive business, accounting for $15 trillion in payment volume across 276 billion transactions last year, there's still room for it to grow. That's particularly the case internationally. Cross-border transaction volume increased 16% year over year in the second quarter, fueling 8% overall growth in payment volume.\n\nVisa benefits from leveraging its existing network, so as payment volume grows, its operating margin generally improves. Operating income through the first six months of the year is up 8.5%. That leads to strong free cash flow growth, which supports an ever-increasing dividend, part of a larger capital return program.\n\nVisa raised its dividend 16% last October to $0.52 per share. That marks its 16th consecutive year of raising its dividend, and investors should expect many more dividend raises in the future. The dividend remains just a small part of its overall capital return program, which includes a $25 billion share repurchase authorization. With a network effect protecting its business from new competitors, investors should expect Visa to continue increasing payment volume and profit for years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. T-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile(NASDAQ: TMUS) is a relatively new dividend payer in an industry well known for paying out high yields on their stocks. The wireless competitor spent a decade or so building up its customer base and pouring tons of cash into building its network, acquiring wireless spectrum licenses, and marketing its service. Following the merger with Sprint, it has a customer base comparable in size to its biggest competitors, and it can leverage its fixed network costs to produce positive free cash flow.\n\nAnd it's producing a lot of free cash flow. Management expects to produce between $16.4 billion and $16.9 billion in cash this year. It's using that cash to repurchase shares and pay a dividend it just initiated last fall. So far, it's used $4.4 billion of its authorization, with an additional $11.7 billion remaining through the end of the year.\n\nT-Mobile consistently produces industry-leading postpaid net customer additions, and its foray into home internet has been a success as well. It now counts over 30 million total postpaid accounts among 99 million customers and over 5 million home internet connections.\n\nImportantly, T-Mobile shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. It's seeing improved customer retention, and its 5G network buildout is ahead of its competitors. It's pushing customers to higher-priced plans, offering them incentives over old plans. And it's becoming increasingly cost-effective as it amortizes its fixed costs over a larger customer base. That should produce great free cash flow for years to come.\n\nWhen T-Mobile initiated its dividend last fall, management said it plans to raise the dividend by 10% per year for the foreseeable future. That should be an easy target to hit for T-Mobile.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nOne of the newest dividend payers in the market is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The company surprised investors when it announced a small dividend alongside its fourth-quarter earnings report in February.\n\nMeta operates Facebook, the largest social network in the world. It counts over 3 billion monthly active users on that platform alone. When you include its Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger apps, it has about 4 billion unique users logging in at least once a month. That's over half the world's population, and that makes it very attractive to advertisers.\n\nAdvertisers spent a whopping $35.6 billion on Meta's apps in the first quarter alone, a 27% year-over-year increase. And it's making big investments, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), to keep growing at that pace.\n\nMeta's annual spending on AI-related expenses will be in the tens of billions of dollars this year. But AI touches just about everything it does. From content recommendations to ad targeting to helping marketers create new campaigns on its platform, AI is integral to Meta's operations. It's investing in an effort to become a leader in generative AI, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees as a big business opportunity in the future.\n\nBut Meta is still returning heaps of cash to shareholders. The dividend is just a small portion of its overall capital return program, which includes $66 billion in share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. Its current total annual dividend payment of about $5 billion has plenty of room to grow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Looking to Double Your Money? Start With These 3 Hot Growth Stocks.",
        "content": "There are plenty of investors out there dreaming of hitting a home run with stocks in their portfolio (in this case a home run is defined as a stock that doubles or more after buying shares) and doing so in less time than the market average. The broader market averages an annualized return of roughly 10% over time, which means doubling your money would take roughly seven years on average.\n\nThese \"home run\" investment opportunities are hard to find, but they are out there and don't require investors to take overly bold risks. Three Motley Fool contributors were asked to offer up suggestions on potential home run growth stocks and landed on Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU), and SentinelOne(NYSE: S). All three have 100% investment upside moving forward.\n\nHere is what you need to know about each.\n\nInvesting in companies with high switching costs is a great way to double your money\n\nJake Lerch (Meta Platforms): For investors looking to double their money, Meta Platforms has shown its potential to do so many times over. Just in the past 18 months or so, Meta's shares have more than tripled in value. That's because Meta has become one of the best companies in the world at converting revenue into profits and profits into shareholder returns.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Meta generated a staggering $143 billion in revenue. Of that $143 billion, the company recorded $46 billion in net income -- a 32% profit margin.Meta used some of that net income to strategically repurchase $25 billion worth of its stock in the last year, effectively reducing its shares outstanding by 1.4%. These buybacks bolster the value of the remaining shares in the market. Along with stock price appreciation, Meta now also pays a quarterly dividend, a move that diversifies its shareholder returns and enhances the attractiveness of its stock to a broader investor base.\n\nGiven the scale of its business -- Meta's user base is enormous, with over 3.2 billion daily active people using its platform -- you would think that continued growth would slow. However, the company remains well-positioned to keep the revenue stream growing and profits going upward. One reason is that its platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) benefit from elevated switching costs. Social media platforms have high switching costs because many users spend years -- even decades -- fine-tuning their preferences in these social media networks. They follow the feeds of family, friends, acquaintances, and celebrities; they seek out hobbyist communities and local businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecreating that established network elsewhere is tough. This can be a long process and most people aren't willing to start over from scratch. That gives the established network an edge and ensures Meta is likely here to stay. For investors looking to double their money, that gives Meta an advantage it its growth efforts.\n\nGrowth investors need to stop overlooking this Brazilian fintech\n\nWill Healy(Nu Holdings): This Latin American digital bank stock should at least double in value in the next few years, and not just because it is up by more than 80% over the last year.\n\nAdmittedly, the NuBank parent is not on the radar of most American investors. Although Warren Buffett's team at Berkshire Hathaway holds a position, the company is largely unknown in the U.S., and winning with the stock requires investors to understand a different finance culture.\n\nUnlike the U.S., Latin America remains a primarily cash-based society where hundreds of millions of adults lack a bank account or credit card. NuBank, which is the largest digital banking platform outside of Asia, is changing that. In one year, nearly 6 million Brazilians obtained their first credit card through Nu, adding them to the credit market. Nu just surpassed 100 million customers. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, 92 million of those customers were in Brazil, which constitutes about 54% of the country's adult population.\n\nTo maintain its rapid growth, Nu has expanded to Mexico and Colombia. The company has over 900,000 Colombian customers. Also, it added 1.5 million customers in Mexico in Q1 alone, taking its total to over 6.6 million. Such successes indicate its business model works in more than one country.\n\nNaturally, the financials reflect this growth. Revenue was $2.7 billion in Q1, a 69% yearly increase. Operating expenses grew by only 48%, allowing net income to rise to $379 million, up from $142 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMoreover, with the aforementioned gain over the last year, the fintech stock has come back from a poorly timed initial public offering in late 2021. NU Chart\n\nDespite Nu's rising stock price, investors are likely not too late. Its P/E ratio is about 45, a low level considering its massive growth. Additionally, since it appears to be repeating its success in Brazil in other countries, doubling its stock price could be just the beginning for Nu Holdings.\n\nSentinelOne's small size but bleeding-edge technology make it a wise bet for a double\n\nJustin Pope (SentinelOne): Cybersecurity stock SentinelOne was a pretty easy choice. Cybersecurity is vital to enterprises and will arguably become even more important as artificial intelligence (AI) and other technology draw more companies to the cloud. According to research by Spherical Insights, the global cybersecurity market will grow by double-digit percentages annually to a $501 billion market by 2030. Today, SentinelOne's trailing-12-month revenue is just $621 million, not even a percent of that.\n\nHow will SentinelOne make its presence felt? Well, it's already starting to. SentinelOne uses AI to run its security platform. It proactively hunts for potential threats and often addresses them before they become an issue. Multiple third-party companies and testing agencies have praised SentinelOne's technology. The company has also aggressively expanded outside its core endpoint security market, launching products for securing data warehousing, cloud, and identity. It's also launching generative AI features to enhance its existing products.\n\nThe new products are helping fuel some of the best revenue growth you'll find on Wall Street. Revenue grew 38% year over year last quarter, and SentinelOne's profit margins are rapidly improving and headed toward profitability as the business grows. S Free Cash Flow (% of Quarterly Revenues) Chart\n\nAt the end of the day, SentinelOne is a small (but cutting-edge) player in a huge market. The company is worth \"just\" $6 billion in enterprise value and trades at its lowest valuation since going public. Strong revenue growth, an advanced, AI-powered product, and eventual profits should boost the stock to a potential double or more from today's levels. It's impossible to predict when it will happen, but it's clear that there is much room to go up from here. That could mean big things for investors' portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Generative AI is on the ballot at Big Tech companies like Meta and Alphabet, as shareholders vote on proposals calling for detailed reports by the companies about how the technology is being used to create and spread misinformation. The shareholder proposals, which will be voted on at each company’s upcoming annual general meeting, reflect growing concerns about the power and prevalence of generative AI.\n\nThe votes come as Google has faced massive blowback over the past week for its new search AI features, which has produced false and often bizarre responses, including telling users to put glue on pizza. Audio and video deepfakes created by AI technology are also proliferating online, raising concerns in an election year.\n\nShareholders in Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, will vote at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday, while investors in Google-parent company Alphabet will weigh in at the company’s annual meeting on June 7. The resolutions come just a few months after a similar proposal at Microsoft’s AGM on December 7, 2023, which was presented by Nirvana co-founder and bassist Krist Novoselic and garnered 21% of the shareholder vote.\n\nThe three proposals were led by ESG activist investor group Arjuna Capital and focus on concerns that generative AI threatens to amplify misinformation and disinformation around the world, particularly during a critical election year in countries like the US and India. A separate shareholder proposal brought to Apple focused on the risks of AI to workers, which was filed by the AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, the largest labor union federation in the US. While the proposal was ultimately voted down by Apple shareholders at its annual meeting in February, proponents of AI transparency won a victory beforehand when the SEC ruled that companies like Apple could not bar shareholders from voting on such matters.\n\nIn the proxy statement for Meta's annual meeting, the shareholder proposal states that \"with Meta’s recent development of gAI products, including conversational assistants and advertising tools, the company is increasingly at risk from misinformation and disinformation generated through its own products.\"\n\nThe proposal calls for the Meta board to “issue a report, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary or legally privileged information, to be published within one year of the Annual Meeting and updated annually thereafter, assessing the risks to the Company’s operations and finances, and to public welfare, presented by the Company’s role in facilitating misinformation and disinformation disseminated or generated via generative Artificial Intelligence; what steps the Company plans to take to remediate those harms; and how it will measure the effectiveness of such efforts.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its response urging shareholders to reject the proposal, Meta pointed to its “five pillars of Responsible AI” which are overseen by its board of directors, as well as its investments in safety and security efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation.\n\n“Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders,” the Proxy Report said.\n\nIn a response to a similar proposal, Alphabet said that its Board of Directors recommended a vote against the stockholder proposal because “Our enterprise risk frameworks, product policies, and tools provide a foundation for identifying and mitigating AI-generated mis/disinformation and other potential risks,” adding that “we continually strive to improve the quality of our generative AI models and applications through both pre-launch testing and ongoing fine-tuning, and we are transparent about our ongoing work via public reporting.”\n\nThe proposals for AI reports at Meta and Alphabet are unlikely to be approved, as both companies have dual class stock that concentrates the voting power in the hands of the founders. Still, the proposals carry symbolic power and have the potential to send a message to management if they earn widespread support from shareholders.\n\nAt December’s Microsoft AGM, Novoselic served as the spokesperson for the shareholder initiative, describing himself as a long-time shareholder. He accused the company of racing forward, “releasing this nascent technology without the appropriate guardrails.” Generative AI, he continued, “is a game-changer, there’s no question, but the rush to market seemingly prioritizes short term profits over long-term success.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Dividend investors look for buy-and-hold stocks with solid financials and plenty of years of future growth. These investors want to generate steady cash flow from their investments and potentially live off their assets in the future.\n\nAchieving long-term portfolio goals starts with picking the right stocks. Investors shouldn’t only consider what an asset looks like right now but also consider how a stock can change within a few years. These top dividend stocks look promising for patient investors.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) offers safety supplies and other resources for more than one million businesses. The company still has a large addressable market since it only serves roughly one million of the 16 million businesses in North America.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has been outperforming the stock market. It’s up by 15% year-to-date and has gained 208% over the past five years. Cintas trades at a 47 P/E ratio and offers a 0.79% yield. Wall Street analysts believe it has more upside. The stock is rated as a “Moderate Buy” with a projected 6% upside from current levels.\n\nRecent financials suggest that Cintas can continue to reward investors. Revenue increased by 9.9% year-over-year in Q3 FY24. Net income was up by 22.0% year-over-year. These growth rates help to support the company’s solid dividend growth rate. Cintas has maintained an annualized growth rate of 21.05% for its dividend over the past decade.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCredit and debit cards aren’t going anywhere. Consumers will continue to use these cards for numerous purchases. It’s easier to make a $1,000 purchase with a credit card than it is to have that much cash in your wallet. These cards also have enticing rewards programs, and on-time payments can help you qualify for more competitive rates and terms for future loans.\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is one of the leaders in the industry and has a market cap north of $500 billion. The stock trades at a 34 P/E ratio with a 0.76% yield. Visa has maintained an impressive annualized dividend growth rate of 18.05% over the past decade. The company has raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years.\n\nThe stock is up by 6% year-to-date and has rallied 70% over the past five years. Wall Street analysts have projected an additional 15% gain for the stock. It is currently rated as a “Strong Buy.”\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) recently initiated a quarterly dividend at $0.50 per share. The company’s vast balance sheet and growing profit margins suggest it will maintain a high dividend growth rate for many years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe social media giant isn’t the best pick for dividend income investors since it only has a 0.42% yield. However, the tech firm checks many boxes for dividend growth investors who want to maximize their returns. The stock has gained 38% year-to-date and is up 169% over the past five years.\n\nMeta Platforms’ recent financial report suggests that it can maintain the stock gains. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year in Q1 2024, while net income more than doubled year-over-year. The company has been trimming its headcount while delivering exceptional results for investors. These developments have won a lot of positive praise from Wall Street analysts. Based on the average price target, the “Strong Buy” stock is projected to gain an additional 9%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Magnificent 7 Becomes 'The Magnificent One': Wall Street Guru Hails Single Tech Stock As Market Leader",
        "content": "Magnificent 7 Becomes 'The Magnificent One': Wall Street Guru Hails Single Tech Stock As Market Leader\n\nSeasoned Wall Street investor Ed Yardeni, founder and CEO of Yardeni Research, has boldly rebranded the Magnificent Seven giants as the “Magnificent One,” referring only to Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the key driver of this year’s market gains.\n\nYardeni noted that the semiconductor giant has rallied by 115% year-to-date, more than three times as much as MetaPlatforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) – the top performer among the “Magnificent Six” – and more than 10 times as much as the broader S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).\n\n“Nvidia is the only clear beneficiary of the AI boom currently because everyone who wants to play has to pay for the company’s expensive GPU chips,” Yardeni said.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the heavy capital expenditures could affect the profitability of Nvidia’s clients, who may not all emerge as winners in the AI competition.\n\nRead also: AI-Driven Rally Set To Expand To Power, Commodities, Utilities: ‘It’s Not Just About Nvidia Anymore’\n\nChart: Nvidia Plays Its Own League In The Year-To-Date Ranking\n\nEconomic Implications Of The AI Expansion: The Roaring 2020s\n\n“In our Roaring 2020s scenario, the technology boom should continue to shrug off the Fed and power productivity, economic growth, and the stock market higher.”\n\nYardeni explained that the Fed's monetary policy is only one of several economic drivers, and they won't need to reduce rates to support economic growth if productivity increases.\n\nNvidia recently reported an “incredible earnings report,” with quarterly net income surging from $2.0 billion in the previous year to $14.9 billion.\n\n“That further confirms our thesis” of a Roaring 2020s scenario, Yardeni said.\n\nThe Wall Street veteran believes the market began to reflect the Roaring 2020s scenario on Nov. 30, 2022, with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Since then, Nvidia has propelled the S&P 500’s semiconductor indexes to new heights.\n\nYardeni assigns a 60% chance to the Roaring 2020s scenario, contrasting with a 20% probability of a “1990s market meltup” and another 20% of a “1970s repeat.”\n\n“Our Roaring 2020s scenario is right on track,” he said.\n\nYardeni’s Roaring 2020s scenario anticipates above-average growth in S&P 500 earnings, GDP, and productivity. Increased productivity is expected to reduce unit labor costs and inflation, continuing a trend that started last year. This ongoing trend, as forecasted, should elevate profit margins to unprecedented levels.\n\nLast week, the veteran investor forecasted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach 60,000 points and the S&P 500 would climb to 8,000 by the decade’s end, assuming the Roaring 2020s scenario materializes.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead now: Dow To Reach 60,000, S&P 500 To Hit 8,000 By 2030 In Wall Street Veteran’s ‘Roaring 2020s Scenario’\n\nPhoto gguy/Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Magnificent 7 Becomes 'The Magnificent One': Wall Street Guru Hails Single Tech Stock As Market Leader originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Love her or hate her, there’s no denying that Cathie Wood is an influential investor. The founder and CEO of investment management firm ARK Invest continues to infuriate and inspire people with her take on the markets and her investment picks. Wood famously focuses the investments in her exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on stocks of companies engaged in disruptive technologies.\n\nThis is especially true of Wood’s flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK). This ETF is comprised of stocks that are either hot or cold and prone to volatile trading. This has led to a good deal of volatility in the ARKK fund itself. Year-to-date, the flagship ETF is down 12% even as the three major U.S. indices are at record highs. Yet Wood remains undaunted and is sticking with her belief in companies offering new technologies.\n\nIf you can only buy one Cathie Wood stock in May, it better be one of these three names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just greenlit spot Ethereum (ETH-USD) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). That decision sent the stock of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) up 9% on the day it was announced. As with the spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs approved in January of this year, the Ethereum funds should provide a further boost to Coinbase, which is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S.\n\nInflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs were largely responsible for Coinbase reporting blockbuster first-quarter financial results that included a surge in profits. The crypto exchange reported EPS of $4.40, which was 303% higher than the $1.09 expected among analysts. Revenue in Q1 totaled $1.64 billion versus $1.34 billion that was expected on Wall Street.\n\nA year earlier, Coinbase reported a loss of $78.9 million, or 34 cents a share. COIN stock is up 318% in the last 12 months. That’s very good news for Cathie Wood as Coinbase is the second largest position in her flagship ARK Innovation ETF.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrypto trading is also pushing the earnings and share price of Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) higher. The online brokerage is also benefitting from the fact that the stock market is at an all-time high and investors are feeling positive. The strength of both crypto and equity trading led Robinhood to post record Q1 financial results. The company announced Q1 EPS of 18 cents on record revenue of $618 million.\n\nThe results beat Wall Street forecasts that had called for earnings of 6 cents a share and revenue of $553 million. A year earlier, Robinhood reported a loss of 57 cents per share on revenue of $441 million. The company attributed the latest results largely to a rise in crypto trading on its platform. Cryptocurrency transaction revenue more than tripled in Q1 from a year earlier, said the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobinhood also said that its assets under custody increased 65% year over year to $129.60 billion due to higher stock and crypto valuations. The company reported net deposits of $11.20 billion for the quarter and $23.90 billion for the last year. HOOD stock has risen 139% in the past 12 months, including a 66% gain so far in 2024. Robinhood Markets is Cathie Wood’s eighth largest position in the ARKK fund.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s not one of Cathie Wood’s largest holdings, but it’s certainly one of her best. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the 19th largest holding in the Ark Innovation ETF. But the social media and artificial intelligence (AI) giant is one of the best-performing tech stocks around. Over the last year, META stock has risen 89%. This year the shares are up nearly 40% despite some big volatility after the company’s Q1 print.\n\nMeta’s most recent earnings report was quite strong, but the stock got knocked lower on concerns about increased spending on new ventures and technologies. Investors shouldn’t worry though as the long-term story around Meta Platforms remains intact. Plus, the company declared its first ever dividend earlier this year, paying stockholders 50 cents a share each quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 28, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, HF Foods Group Inc. HFFG and Blue Dolphin Energy Co. BDCO.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and Exxon Mobil\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks HF Foods Group Inc. and Blue Dolphin Energy Co. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA has literally become the post child for AI leverage, which can be seen in the company's blockbuster stock market performance (+173.9% vs. +134.0% for the chips industry). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+87.0% vs. +44.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives.\r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nExxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+12.1% vs. +11.9%). The company is a reliable player in the energy sector, boasts a resilient capital structure and a track record of prudent capex management. Its strategic discoveries in the Stabroek Block and Permian Basin promise growth and lower greenhouse gas intensity.\r\n\r\nWith a robust balance sheet, ExxonMobil prioritizes shareholder returns, evidenced by substantial buybacks and the strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company aims to increase its annual share buybacks to $20 billion through 2025.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges loom, notably in the upstream operations, which are susceptible to volatile oil prices and regulatory hurdles. While committed to shareholders, ExxonMobil faces scrutiny for lagging industry peers in terms of dividend yield. Reliance on finding economically recoverable reserves and exposure to OPEC production cuts add to uncertainties.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of HF Foods have underperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $165.72 million is facing challenges which include high debt levels, low net profit margins, declining cash flow, and inventory management issues. Dependence on the Asian restaurant market, exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical risks pose concerns.\r\n\r\nThe impact of exiting the chicken processing business and the risks associated with transformation initiatives persist. Nevertheless, HF Foods' revenues increased 0.6% year over year in first-quarter 2024 despite exiting its chicken processing business in 2023.\r\n\r\nProfitability improved significantly, with net loss narrowing and adjusted EBITDA increasing.

        "title": "Is There Now An Opportunity In Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Meta Platforms’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 14% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $559.22, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Meta Platforms’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from Meta Platforms? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 52%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in META’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on META, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

        "content": "In the ever-changing market, savvy investors look for bright prospects to profit from the game-changing potential of technology stocks. Here are three major players. The first one sticks out for its unwavering dedication to operational effectiveness and cost control. The firm has experienced a significant increase in sales, but its cost control measures demonstrate a robust operating model that generates strong margins and solid market value.\n\nMeanwhile, the second one, renowned for its revolutionary developments in electric cars, has now expanded its horizons to the energy industry. With its energy business witnessing record profitability and its energy storage deployments projected to rise astounding through 2024, the firm has firmly established itself as a major player in the renewable energy solutions market, instilling confidence in its growth potential.\n\nFinally, the third one deftly negotiates the semiconductor market, using operational excellence and regional expansion as engines of success. Its robust presence in developing nations like China and Korea attests to the company’s skill at establishing a foothold in strategic areas and leveraging the need for semiconductor solutions throughout the world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) maintains great cost control and operating edge alongside revenue growth and investments in infrastructure and AI. The company uses resources wisely, striking a balance between tight cost management techniques and investments in emerging fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and Reality Labs. For instance, Q1 2024 total costs and expenses came to $22.64 billion, a slight year-over-year rise of 6%. This shows effective revenue growth cost control, producing operating solid margins.\n\nAdditionally, Meta is positioned for long-term development and innovation because it prioritizes infrastructure, immersive technologies, and sophisticated AI models to support future product development and preserve competitiveness. With expected increases to support the AI roadmap and Reality Labs efforts, capex for Q1 was $6.72 billion.\n\nLastly, despite large expenditures, the business produces a sizable amount of free cash flow and has enough liquidity to fund expansion plans and satisfy shareholders. With $12.53 billion in free cash flow for Q1, Meta executed repurchases of $14.64 billion of its Class A common shares and delivered $1.27 billion in dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Megapack, one of Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) energy storage deployments, hit a high mark in Q1, resulting in record profitability for the energy segment. Looking forward, Tesla projects that the deployment of energy storage will increase by at least 75% in 2024 compared to 2023. Further, record-high installations and margins indicate Tesla’s energy sector’s robust growth and profitability. Thus, such expansion in the energy industry broadens Tesla’s sources of income and boosts the company’s overall profitability considerably.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla is continuously growing its core AI infrastructure, and in Q1, it doubled its AI training compute sequentially. Approximately 35,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 chips have been installed and engaged into service by the company for training purposes. By 2024, Tesla hopes to have 85,000 installed. Tesla is making considerable and fast-growing investments in AI infrastructure and autonomous driving tech.\n\nOverall, Tesla’s focus on improving its autonomous driving capabilities is reflected in deploying sophisticated AI training computing resources. Therefore, this tech advantage solidifies future advancements in autonomous vehicle technology by boosting the functionality of current offerings like full self-driving (FSD).\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe revenue distribution of Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) throughout various areas demonstrates the company’s accomplishments in regional expansion and market penetration. Lam Research has a significant presence in one of the fastest-growing semiconductor markets, with 42% of sales coming from the China area in Q3 2024. Indeed, multinational expenditure in China has increased, which is another proof of Lam Research’s success in this market.\n\nMoreover, Korea is a noteworthy market for Lam Research, accounting for 24% of its sales. The company’s excellent market penetration and client base growth in Korea reflect the increase in revenue share in this area. Japan and Taiwan are significant markets for Lam Research, even if they are less significant than China and Korea. Hence, these markets support the company’s worldwide revenue-diversification strategy.\n\nFinally, Lam Research’s potential for rapid expansion is further supported by its performance lead and operational edge. By surpassing the midpoint of the projected range and achieving a gross margin of 48.7% in Q3, Lam Research demonstrated its capacity to optimize both the product and customer mix and plant efficiency. Thus, Lam Research has generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow, or 34% of revenue, highlighting the company’s fundamental ability to turn income into cash effectively.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in META.

        "content": "The metaverse is still a work in progress. After Facebook decided to change its company name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) back in 2021, many investors thought the metaverse would be the next big thing for entertainment and online interactions. While there is definitely some evidence of that, much of the equities gains in metaverse-related stocks have been concentrated with the large tech companies. The Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), for example, has risen 8.6% year-to-date (YTD), but the gains have come from names like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta.\n\nBelow are three metaverse stocks to sell now before it’s too late.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) provides the software and platform for creators to build 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets and personal computers. In particular, Unity offers Create Solutions, a set of tools and services used to build, ship and run real-time 2D and 3D content as well as its Grow Solutions product, which provides creators with a way to grow and engage their user base while monetizing their content. Unity Software has been under scrutiny from both users and investors. The software firm announced a restructuring plan in January that would see the company cutting 25% of its workforce. While this pleased investors, Unity Software still issued weak guidance for Q1’2024 just a month later.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWeak guidance coupled with an ongoing restructuring plan has made investors skittish on U shares. The stock has collapsed 51% since the start of the year.\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) MTCH stock: the Match group logo on a computer screen with a phone displaying its site\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) may be an unfamiliar name to readers, but the holding company’s dating products are probably not. Tinder, Hinge and Match compose Match Group’s extensive list of wholly-owned dating apps. While not a staple name in the metaverse sector, the company has been looking into integrating virtual experiences and augmented reality (AR) into its platforms. For instance, Tinder has experimented with features that incorporate AR and virtual environments, such as Swipe Night. an interactive video series where users make choices that affect the storyline and who they match with.\n\nUnfortunately, the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty has negatively affected Match Group’s financial performance. Despite beating Wall Street estimates in their Q1’2024 earnings report, Match Group reported a 9% decline in its paying user base, bringing the total figure below 10 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nContinued weak consumer discretionary spending will hamper Match Group’s near and medium-term growth prospects. Shares have dipped almost 20% YTD.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen discussing online or virtual entertainment, it is hard to not discuss gaming giant Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). The platform’s Roblox Studio product empowers ordinary users to build and publish their own 3D content and experiences. Roblox Client is where users can game and explore various kinds of 3D gaming content.\n\nAlthough Roblox is clearly a growing platform with millions of users, the platform has struggled with profitability in recent years. Roblox’s Q1’2024 earnings print figures saw the company missed Wall Street’s estimates for revenue and booking. Also, the company’s net loss did not improve on a year-over-year basis. Weak bookings guidance for Q2 highlighted the growth headwinds facing the platform.\n\nRBLX shares are down nearly 27% on a YTD basis.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Buying the dips and acquiring shares of a proven company on short-term declines has been a successful strategy over the long-term. When investors look back five or 10 years from now, the opportunities which presented themselves during the Great Recession, the COVID trough, or even the recent downturn in 2022 were worth buying. Of course, it may not have felt that way at the time. But that’s why buying undervalued stocks with solid future prospects is important to do in good times and bad.\n\nI think these undervalued stocks could surge back just like the Magnificent 7 did after their respective downturns. By investing in these companies, you could potentially triple your money by 2026.\n\nHere are seven undervalued stocks to consider right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PYPL stock, PayPal logo overlays daylight photo of corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) didn’t post the best results this past earnings season. There are some promising signs with this fintech giant. But important work must be done to get the company back on track. PayPal reported $7.7 billion in revenue, beating analysts’ estimates by $183 million. However, earnings per share of $1.08 fell short of projections by 14 cents.\n\nEarly testing of the company’s new Fast Lane checkout experience is yielding nearly a 10% increase in conversions for first-time users. Rolling this out more broadly in Q2 could provide an even more meaningful meaningful boost.\n\nThis company has an unshakable merchant base and is a household name. I do not think PYPL stock will remain at these valuations forever, given the level of buybacks they’re doing and revenue growth expected to remain around 8% annually. User account growth is the most important metric with PayPal, and while this number fell following the pandemic, it has turned positive again, at least on a quarterly basis. Thus, the recent decline in PYPL stock seems very irrational given the underlying fundamentals. PYPL financials.

This is an increase from previous guidance. The payments giant still has significant work ahead to prove a successful turnaround. But if PayPal can effectively execute on its plans, the stock may deliver strong returns from current levels.\n\nMeituan (MPNGY) Chinese new year lanterns in china town\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nMeituan’s (OTCMKTS:MPNGY) latest business update made me feel very optimistic about the company’s growth trajectory. Many solid Chinese companies have plunged due to China’s broad-based decline in its stock markets. However, Chinese stocks have been recovering well recently, and I think Meituan has a long road of recovery ahead.\n\nWith revenue surging nearly 26% to reach RMB 276.7 billion and adjusted net profit skyrocketing to RMB 23.3 billion in 2023, Meituan seems to be firing on all cylinders. The food delivery giant is capitalizing on the rapid growth in China’s local commerce industry, with daily order volumes jumping almost 24% to a staggering 60 million.\n\nBut what really excites me is Meituan’s relatively new instashopping service. In my opinion, that part of the business is the real gem. Orders for this segment soared over 40%, as the company successfully cultivated the habit of receiving everything you need within 30 minutes.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if the company’s share price tripled over the next few years if Meituan remains profitable.

SNAP stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnapchat (NYSE:SNAP) is arguably the most undervalued social media stock you can buy right now. I think this stock could have a recovery that mirrors that of Meta’s (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThat’s partly due to the company’s strong Q1 results, which have made me feel optimistic about the company’s trajectory. With revenue accelerating 21% year-over-year to $1.19 billion and daily active users growing 10% to 422 million, Snap is showing real momentum. I’m particularly encouraged by the 75%+ growth in purchase-related conversions driven by their 7-0 Pixel Purchase optimization model. The company’s earnings per share outlook also looks solid, which is why I think Snap could mirror Meta’s performance. SNAP EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIf Snap can continue executing on its strategic priorities of diversifying revenue, growing engagement, and leading in AR, I believe the stock has serious multi-bagger potential by 2026. The company’s ability to reach over 75% of 13-34 year-olds in 25+ countries representing half the global ad market is a major asset.\n\nI think a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. could be a massive catalyst for Snap. The company would be a clear prime beneficiary in terms of both users and ad dollars. TikTok’s issues could become Snap’s opportunity.\n\nWith strong Q1 numbers and several potential growth levers, Snap looks like a compelling buy for patient investors willing to hold through 2026.\n\nSprinklr (CXM) The Sprinklr (CXM) logo on a smartphone sitting on a wood table.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nI feel optimistic about Sprinklr’s (NYSE:CXM) future despite the “premium” valuation associated with this stock. The company’s revenue grew by 17% year over year to $194.2 million, handily beating the forecasts. Additionally, recurring subscription income grew solidly by 19% to $177 million.\n\nIn my opinion, Sprinklr seems to be making smart strategic moves to set itself up for continued growth. Bringing in experienced executives like Trac Pham as interim chief operations officer and Amitabh Misra from Adobe as chief technology officer could be a real difference-maker in terms of their operational expertise.\n\nMost exciting is Sprinklr’s opportunity in the evolving field of generative artificial intelligence. After 14 years spent building a robust backend foundation, the company provides plenty of AI exposure to investors. And yes, you are paying 31-times forward earnings for this stock. But as long as Wall Street holds up that premium as earnings rise, this stock could still deliver solid returns in the coming years.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a renewable energy company focused on solar. Much like the EV industry, the solar industry has had difficulties in recent quarters. Most new flashy businesses in industries that require lots of capital have plunged. Accordingly, the latest report on Enbridge’s business performance also reveals the company is facing challenges in current market conditions. Revenue for the quarter came in at $263.3 million, down 63.7% year-over-year. This was well below the level financial analysts had predicted. Shipments of their microinverters and battery storage systems, at 1.4 million units and 75.5 megawatt hours, respectively, were also lower than hoped.\n\nThe number of microinverters and batteries sold to final customers in the U.S. dropped 23% from the previous quarter. That’s a worrying sign that demand may be decreasing. Notably, the situation in California was particularly weak, with sales of microinverters there falling 37%. The transition to their new NEM 3.0 energy program is clearly impacting business.\n\nGross profit margins at 46% look okay at first glance. However, this number benefitted from tax credits available through the Inflation Reduction Act. Cash flow generation slowed as well, coming in at just $41.8 million for the period. With $113 million worth of products still sitting in inventory in the sales channel, Enphase’s near-term business prospects seem uncertain. That said, if an investor is willing to hold the stock for the long-run, I’m confident Enphase can deliver solid returns. ENPH financial estimates.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts expect earnings per share to rise from $2.9 in 2024 to $6.3 in 2026. If that’s the case, this stock could be worth a buy, despite all the hair on it.\n\nInspire Medical Systems (INSP) couple sleeping in bed, man hugging her. VVOS stock\n\nSource: Motortion Films / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve been keeping a close eye on Inspire Medical (NYSE:INSP) for some time now. While the company may not be a household name, I believe Inspire has tremendous potential to grow in the coming years.\n\nInspire delivered very impressive results in Q1, with revenue increasing by 28% year-over-year, reaching $164 million. This strong growth was being driven by greater adoption of the company’s sleep apnea therapy solutions in both the United States and international markets. Based on this positive momentum, Inspire’s leadership team updated their revenue guidance for the full year to a new range between $783-793 million and targets continued growth of 25-27%.\n\nInspire is not profitable right now, but it expects to be profitable for all of 2024. The company’s management team provided initial guidance estimating their earnings will be somewhere in the range of 10-20 cents per share. As their business matures and they gain efficiencies, I foresee their profitability increasing sharply from here. This could lead to tremendous upside. Analysts expect 2026 earnings per share to come in around $2.20, and if you zoom out, this figure could reach as high as $10 in 2031.\n\nYou’re paying a premium for sure, so this stock is not really one of the “undervalued stocks,” if you look at it from a near-term perspective. But with the long-term trend in mind, I think it fits.

In Q1, the company increased revenue by an impressive 27% to $76 million while achieving $3.8 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding even optimistic projections.\n\nWhat particularly piqued my interest was the CEO noting their addressable market estimate has expanded to 480 million potential user accounts, up from 370 million at the time of their initial public offering in 2021. According to Alkami’s research, 58% of regional banks and credit unions are open to switching to a different digital banking platform provider. That’s a big opportunity.\n\nI expect Alkami’s growth trajectory to become even steeper over time, as earnings per share rises from 21 cents in 2024 to 88 cents in 2026.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "A handful of top S&P 500 stocks to buy tend to take the spotlight, many with good reason. Still, companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) comprise an increasingly high position in the index’s overall ranking and that is reasonable cause for concern for those prioritizing effective diversification planning.\n\nAt the same time, plenty of stinkers exist among S&P 500 stocks, making broad-based index investing less than ideal. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are each down nearly 40% since January alone, with indications that each (and others) is facing further pain ahead.\n\nThat’s why focusing your S&P 500 stocks to buy selection on a handful of well-known names near the top coupled with diversified, lesser-known winners in the middle is a surefire way to create an alternate series of S&P 500 investments — without the relative overweight of a select few companies, while simultaneously cutting out some dead wood.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an easy pick for a list of top S&P 500 stocks to buy. Well-loved, pervasive, and continually expanding, Amazon’s wide-ranging offerings and cultural innovation ensure that the company will remain a staple in our lives for the foreseeable future — not to mention part of our collective investment portfolios.\n\nWhile Amazon’s ongoing retail efforts impact consumers and are noteworthy in their own right, Amazon’s potential as a long-term player among S&P 500 stocks is its cloud service segment. As more companies pivot to remote models or try to save hardware costs by relying on cloud data storage, Amazon’s web services are becoming a key part of many other business models and operations. That’s why Amazon’s recent $25 billion quarterly sales stat is huge news — Amazon is on track to secure $100 billion from its web service segment alone, setting up a perpetual cash flow machine as network switching costs tend to be high and existing clients stick with what they know.\n\nDeere & Co (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) is one of my favorite S&P 500 stocks to buy. But it’s in an unlikely category: robotics and automation. While robotics and automation are hot topics, Deere tends to go under-appreciated in a wider market that favors startups and more niche offerings. That’s a mistake because—once Deere unveils the full scope and extent of its robotics offerings—the company could quickly become one of the top robotics stocks in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeere’s flagship offerings in the category include fully autonomous tractors and tillage machines, which leverage advanced mapping and sensing tech to save agricultural producers time and energy when it comes to prepping fields or harvesting.\n\nAnd, while the autonomous tractors have clear and viable operational prospects today, Deere could see big money coming down the pipe in the future as part of licensing agreements to leverage its newly developed tech.\n\nFor example, self-driving car companies could license portions of Deer’s neural network sensing mechanisms that determine if the area is safe to drive over or not, or drone delivery startups could license Deer’s mapping tools to build a city delivery overlay.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a powerhouse among S&P 500 stocks to buy, seamlessly integrating innovative technology, robotics, and the global growth trajectory of healthcare. As a key player in both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is undeniably stable and increasingly relied upon as a provider of high-end, specialized medical equipment.\n\nUnlike competitors focused on conventional medical hardware, Intuitive Surgical revolutionizes surgery to enhance provider efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nThe company is expanding aggressively worldwide as the healthcare industry continues its post-pandemic rebound. The latest quarterly report highlighted a significant 16% year-over-year increase in the global use of its premier robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, and a consistent installation rate (312 units installed in Q1 2023 and 313 units installed this year).\n\nThis progress, coupled with an 11% sales increase and a rise in net income to $545 million from $355 million, solidifies Intuitive Surgical’s position as one of today’s top stocks to buy.\n\nKeep an eye on Intuitive Surgical this year as the company unveils its next-generation da Vinci platform. According to CEO Gary Guthart, this new model will boast “10,000 times the processing power” of current versions, significantly enhancing data analysis, sensing technology, and overall digital and analytical functions.\n\nVICI Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nVICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) owns and partially operates multiple famous Las Vegas properties, including Caesar’s Palace, the Venetian, and MGM Grand.\n\nThis impressive portfolio alone makes VICI worth considering, as Vegas will unlikely lose its global appeal anytime soon. The REIT entered the public market relatively recently, in 2017, following Caesars Entertainment’s (NASDAQ:CZR) bankruptcy proceedings. While Caesars Entertainment still operates Caesars Palace, VICI owns the land and property itself, creating a self-sustaining flywheel that effectively transfers cash from gamblers’ pockets into VICI’s with minimal disruption in the middle.\n\nSince its IPO, VICI’s stock has returned 60%, with gross returns exceeding 120% when factoring in dividends. VICI has maintained a solid 5%+ dividend over the past seven years, with its current 12-month trailing yield at 5.78%. This competitive yield beats most high-yield savings accounts today while the stock itself offers plenty of room to run — in other words, typifying the best long-term S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nI think Elon Musk, love him or hate him, remains a once-in-a-generation business magnate and eternal innovator. That’s why, despite recent challenges, I see buying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at today’s prices as one of the best long-term investment opportunities among all S&P 500 stocks.\n\nMoreover, the company’s current prospects are better than many suggest. While car sales have slumped, this reflects the broader economic landscape rather than Tesla’s potential. Additionally, Tesla is maturing and diversifying its revenue streams, similar to legacy automakers and their cash flow-generating machines.\n\nIn its most recent filing, Tesla posted a 25% increase in services and a 7% rise in energy generation and storage sales. Although these top-line increases often go unnoticed, they are crucial. As Tesla’s market matures, early forays into alternative revenue streams will be essential for its long-term positioning.\n\nFinally, Musk’s promises of developing artificial intelligence and robotics within the wider Tesla ecosystem have real potential. It may take another decade to realize those gains, much like Tesla’s stock over the past ten years, but the long-term prospects are promising.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is often top-of-mind when mentioning tech stocks to buy, and for good reason. The company’s pervasive operational arms touch most of us daily, fostering a culture of growth and innovation. Fortunately for long-term buyers, the current per-share pricing is discounted after shares slid due to management’s spending breakdown and a muted sales forecast, despite a 117% increase in quarterly net income. Meta’s performance indicators were stellar for the first quarter of 2024, with highlights including higher daily active user rates, improved ad impressions, increased ad spending, and over $15 billion returned to shareholders. Despite this, the stock dropped dramatically — but don’t let that dissuade you.\n\nMuch of the short-term turbulence came from higher cost projections, which is actually a positive sign. A planned record-high series of capital expenditures, primarily focused on enhancing Meta’s artificial intelligence capabilities, weighed on investors’ minds. Zuckerberg noted that this would “grow [Meta’s] investment envelope meaningfully before [it makes] much revenue from some of these new products.”\n\nWhile some may view Zuckerberg’s varied metaverse initiatives as a historical pre-play for Meta’s AI prospects, it’s important to consider the company’s long history of forward-thinking projections that take time to bear fruit. Given Meta’s track record, this temporary dip presents a compelling opportunity among S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is last on the list of S&P 500 stocks to buy. Unlike Google (NASDAQ: GOOG, NASDAQ: GOOGL), it offers institutional and individual investors smart money management, significant long-term upside, and forward-thinking management that continues to innovate despite the company’s size.\n\nMicrosoft’s strategic positioning within the AI sector will likely benefit the company significantly in the future. Even if you’re skeptical of some of the more extravagant AI claims, it’s clear that AI threatens legacy search engines while offering new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft’s existing software suite. Microsoft’s investment in leading AI firm OpenAI gives it a front-row seat and a strong position to capitalize on the next big technological advancements.\n\nWe find ourselves in a position similar to the early 2000s, when the potential of search engine technology was just emerging, and no one fully grasped its future profitability. No public company is as well-aligned with that future potential as Microsoft, and its role in doing so aligns itself well with nearly every prudent investment strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "With the world fighting to go green, it just makes sense to invest in renewable energy stocks to buy.\n\nLook at First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR). In early April, I highlighted an opportunity in the solar stock, as it traded at around $163. Today, it’s up to around $277.\n\nAll thanks to the news that it is well-positioned to benefit from rising electricity demand from artificial intelligence giants looking for clean power for their data centers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, according to CNBC:\n\n“AI uses 10 times more electricity than traditional Google search, according to UBS. As electricity demand from AI grows, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google unit has committed to buying renewable power that matches their consumption.”\n\nThat news alone could send FSLR to higher highs.\n\nOr, look at Cameco (NYSE:CCJ), which is still benefiting from surging uranium demand. Since bottoming out in March at around $39, it’s now up to $53. Even copper stocks have been hot with President Biden’s latest tariffs on China, such as Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX).\n\nOutside of those three, here are some of top renewable energy stocks to buy and hold.\n\nNexGen Energy (NXE) Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned NexGen Energy (NYSE:NXE), it traded at $7.25 on May 15. After testing a high of $8.14, it pulled back with the broader market. But with the uranium story hotter than ever, with demand outstripping supply, it’s still a solid long-term bet. It’s also benefiting from the news that Congress has prohibited uranium imports from Russia.\n\nAccording to Energy.gov, that ban “brings us one step closer to developing a reliable supply of nuclear fuel that will be required by the United States and its allies to triple nuclear capacity by 2050.” As such, the U.S. government will reportedly ask uranium companies to bid on contracts for about $3.4 billion of domestically produced nuclear reactor fuel.\n\nWe also have to remember the company’s CEO Leigh Curyer “emphasized the growing recognition of nuclear energy and the need for new uranium sources, positioning the Rook I project as a key supplier,” as noted by Investing.com.\n\nSouthern Copper (SCCO) Southern Copper Corporation logo on a phone screen in front of the logo on a computer screen. SCCO stock.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\n\nWe can also jump into the copper rally, which should continue to boost Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO).\n\nSupply-demand issues and new Chinese tariffs sent the mining company higher-to-date. But it could race even higher with AI.\n\nAfter all, copper wires and power cables are essential for electric companies, which are seeing higher demand for energy at AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Gavekal Research analyst Tan Kai Xian said this about what is driving copper highler along with utility stocks:\n\n“The electrification of everything theme, whether it be the replacement of hydrocarbons as a primary fuel source, or the use of power-hungry cloud computing to run all aspects of our economy and lives”\n\nCopper is also seeing a boost for increased demand for renewable energy and electric vehicles, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts. With SCCO, I’d use recent weakness as an opportunity to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nEvery time I talk about renewable energy, I like to add lithium stocks, like Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) to the mix. After all, lithium will see heavy demand, which will have a positive impact on ALB.\n\nRemember, according to Statista, by 2030, global demand for lithium is expected to pass 2.4 metric tons, which doubles the demand forecast for 2025.\n\nBy 2035, they added, demand could reach 3.8 million tons. Then, by 2040, lithium demand could increase 40 times over with expectations for increased EV adoption and energy storage needs.\n\nAlso, while we wait for ALB to push higher, we can collect its yield of 1.25%.\n\nBetter, the company just announced a dividend of 40 cents, which will be payable on July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 14. Adding on to this, analysts at Deutsche Bank just raised their price target on ALB to $140 with a hold rating. RBC Capital also raised its target to $157, with an outperform rating thanks to strong earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Social media continues to be a force in society and in the business world. The latest industry statistics show that there are 5.17 billion social media users worldwide today. The average person uses seven different social media networks each month, spending, on average, two hours and 38 minutes each day on the platforms and websites. That’s a lot of time online and accounts for the sector’s continued growth alongside some strong social media stocks to buy.\n\nSocial media companies continue to rely on online advertising for almost all of their revenue. Those ad dollars are rolling in once again after suffering a pullback coming out of the pandemic. This year, social media advertising is projected to reach $220 billion. Advertising on social media is getting a boost from two catalysts in the second half of 2024, the Paris Olympics this summer and the U.S. presidential election in the autumn.\n\nHere are three social media stocks to buy now in May 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is getting a big boost from a resurgence in online advertising on its social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. While the company tends to get a lot of attention for its focus on artificial intelligence (AI), the truth is that Meta Platforms remains, first and foremost, a social media concern. Advertising revenue, which accounts for most of Meta’s business, rose 27% in the first quarter to $35.64 billion.\n\nAnother reason to be bullish on Meta Platforms is that the company has begun paying a dividend to its stockholders. Meta now pays a dividend of 50 cents a share each quarter. Meta is also undertaking an expanded $50 billion share repurchase program. The dividend and stock buybacks are just one more reason to take a position in META stock. Over the last 12 months, the company’s share price has risen 89%.\n\nReddit (RDDT) In this photo illustration the Reddit logo seen displayed on a smartphone and on the background. RDDT and the Reddit IPO\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media company Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) has wasted no time building on its successful initial public offering (IPO) at the end of March this year. The company, which runs online message boards and chat rooms, issued a strong first earnings report as a publicly traded company, sending its stock up 15% as a result. Then, Reddit announced a new partnership with AI start-up company OpenAI, which sent its stock up another 11%.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership is expected to attract more users to Reddit’s social media platform with helpful AI-enhancements. OpenAI has also agreed to advertise on Reddit’s platform, giving a boost to the company’s earnings. Going forward, Reddit will leverage OpenAI’s technology, including its ChatGPT chatbot, to build tools and features that integrate Reddit’s content in real time.\n\nStory continues\n\nReddit generates nearly 100% of its revenue from online advertising on its message boards. Strong advertising dollars enabled Reddit to beat analyst estimates with its most recent earnings print. RDDT stock is up 24% since the company’s IPO two months ago.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nShares of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) have been a tear over the last year. PINS stock has risen 78% in the last 12 months, including a 14% gain this year. It’s a big reversal for the company that enables people to share videos and images online. Coming out of the pandemic, Pinterest’s stock got hit hard. So hard, in fact, that PINS stock is still 52% below its 2021 peak. Still, the company now has 500 million monthly active users.\n\nThe recovery over the past year has been due to better-than-expected financial results that have shown consistent growth in the company’s revenue. Like the other names on this list, Pinterest is benefitting as online advertising comes storming back. PINS stock jumped 18% higher in one day after the company’s first-quarter earnings print. The results showed that Pinterest’s revenue for the quarter rose 23% to $740 million. Both sales and profits crushed Wall Street forecasts.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Here are seven high-octane tech stocks to buy for May. These companies are on pace for rapid growth thanks to strong fundamentals and innovative business models that promise long-term gains for investors.\n\nGiven the rising S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, which generally signal robust market conditions, investors should look for tech stocks that can capitalize on these trends. The three companies discussed in this article stand out due to their ability to overcome challenges and leverage broader market opportunities.\n\nTheir strengths, including accelerating revenue growth and profitability, indicate that they are well-positioned to thrive. Instead of sticking to a broad-based ETF, investors should consider these high-potential names, especially since I predict the AI boom will drive significant advancements in the tech sector for some time to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are seven high-octane tech stocks to buy for this month.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Coinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has benefited from the surge in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company’s return to profitability and the increasing popularity of crypto transactions position it well for future growth.\r\n\r\nCoinbase’s stock price increased by approximately 300%, underscoring its strong position in the digital asset market. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs supports this growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Coinbase reported significant financial improvements with revenue reaching $1.64 billion, up 122% from the same period in 2023, and a net income of $1.18 billion, a stark contrast to the loss reported in the previous year.\r\n\r\nCoinbase’s future outlook remains optimistic. The company forecasts continued institutional investment in Bitcoin and anticipates favorable macroeconomic conditions and regulatory advancements, which are expected to support long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nCOIN is one of my top picks for this year and I think we’ve only started to see the potential of the company.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has demonstrated impressive growth, particularly with a 25% year-over-year (YOY) increase in Q4 revenue, reaching $40.11 billion. The company is focusing on efficiency, scaling back costs, and enhancing AI technologies.\n\nThis strong performance is attributed to a positive shift in ad pricing growth and robust online commerce advertising. The increase in ad pricing marks a return to growth for the first time since Q4 2021, bolstered by significant contributions from China-based advertisers.\r\n\r\nThe company plans to invest $30-37 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, primarily in AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers. This investment is aimed at supporting its long-term AI research and product development efforts. This growth is supported by the successful implementation of cost management strategies and increased monetization efforts through features like Reels and WhatsApp Channels​.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA could be one of those undervalued picks in the stock market for aggressive investors, which is why I recommend it as one to watch.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plays a critical role in the expansion of 5G networks and mobile technology. Despite a recent slowdown in mobile phone sales, the company’s strong position in the 5G market and a robust dividend yield make it an attractive long-term investment​.\r\n\r\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2024, Qualcomm reported strong financial results, with revenues reaching $9.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.44, surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was driven by increased sales in handset and automotive chips. Despite a slight decline in gross margins, the company’s financial performance remains solid.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, Qualcomm has set ambitious growth targets. The company expects its QCT segment to achieve mid-teens compound annual growth rates (CAGR) and maintain operating margins above 30% by fiscal 2024. Additionally, Qualcomm projects automotive revenues to grow to approximately $3.5 billion in five years and $8 billion in ten years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to gain market share in the semiconductor industry with strong performance in its Data Center and Client segments. In the first quarter of 2024, AMD reported revenue of $5.5 billion, marking a 2% YOY increase. The company also achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 52% and a net income of $123 million.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, AMD has set an optimistic outlook for 2024, expecting revenue to reach approximately $5.7 billion in the second quarter, representing a 6% YOY growth. This positive projection is driven by increased demand for its high-performance computing products.\n\nThe company’s focus on edge AI with its Ryzen line positions it well to dominate in this emerging market. CEO Lisa Su has projected the AI accelerator market to reach $400 billion by 2027, nearly 300% growth from this year.\r\n\r\nAMD is a great alternative to the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), as it has a far lower valuation than the microchip giant.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Shopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) remains a leader in e-commerce platforms, with significant revenue growth and recent profitability.\r\n\r\nIn Q4 2023, Shopify reported a 24% increase in revenue, reaching $2.1 billion. The company also achieved a free cash flow of $905 million, compared to a negative free cash flow of $186 million the previous year. This marked a significant turnaround.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Shopify projects revenue growth at a low-twenties percentage rate on a YOY basis. This translates into a mid-to-high-twenties growth rate when adjusted for the impact of selling its logistics businesses. Gross margin for Q1 is on track to increase by approximately 150 basis points compared to Q4 2023.\n\nSHOP is one of my favorite picks for investors seeking one of those high-octane tech stocks for gains. Despite these positive indicators, Shopify’s stock experienced a decline due to lower-than-expected free cash flow guidance for 2024. I still think that long-term SHOP should be on investors’ radars.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoupang (NYSE:CPNG) is expanding into new verticals like travel and dining. Despite a significant drop from its IPO price, analysts forecast strong earnings and revenue growth, with a projected stock price target averaging $26.67, suggesting a potential upside of 19.2% from the current price.\r\n\r\nCoupang’s diversified services include Rocket Fresh for grocery delivery, Coupang Eats for restaurant ordering and delivery, and Coupang Play for online content streaming. These offerings have significantly boosted customer engagement, supported by over 100 fulfillment centers across South Korea.\n\nFinancially, Coupang has consistently reported positive cash flows. In the last four quarters, the company achieved an operating cash flow of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion. This positive financial performance is further highlighted by a 27% YOY increase in gross profits to $1.6 billion.\n\nCPNG could be a good pick for investors who want to diversify their portfolios outside of the United States, as CPNG is essentially the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of South Korea.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), a Chinese EV manufacturer, has shown impressive growth, with revenue increasing by 271% last quarter. It outsold Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in China for October 2023, and its hybrid EVs are gaining significant market share in China. The company delivered 80,400 vehicles in Q1 2024.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company is advancing its autonomous driving technology, with plans to roll out AD Max 3.0, featuring full-scenario autonomous driving capabilities and enhanced safety systems.\n\nFinancially, Li Auto has consistently reported positive cash flows, with Q3 2023 showing a free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The company also achieved a gross profit margin of 25.3% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.9%.\n\nChinese-brand EVs like Li will likely continue to perform strongly, even despite Biden’s recent tariffs on these companies. Asia is fast becoming the hotspot for the market, and I feel that this will continue to grow in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Proposals have no chance of passing, as Mr Zuckerberg has majority control over shares - Susan Walsh/AP\n\nMark Zuckerberg is facing a shareholder revolt over Facebook and Instagram’s approach to child safety, as his social media empire comes under growing scrutiny for its impact on adolescents.\n\nThe advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis have told investors to support a shareholder proposal calling for more disclosures over how parent company Meta approaches keeping children safe.\n\nThe resolution, which will be voted on at Wednesday’s annual meeting, calls for Meta to set targets to measure how it affects child safety and report annually on its performance. It has been put forward by Lisette Cooper, the mother of Sarah Cooper, who said she was groomed over Facebook at the age of 15.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeta often faces pressure from investors over its approach to child safety, and the non-binding resolutions have no chance of passing, since Mr Zuckerberg has majority control over Meta’s shares.\n\nHowever, new laws designed to protect children online mean that shareholders consider there to be a growing risk if Meta is seen as taking a lax approach to child safety.\n\nThe shareholder proposal, which is also supported by a string of church groups, says: “Meta’s website lists some steps taken to improve child safety, but it has no publicly available, company-wide child safety or harm reduction performance targets for investors and stakeholders to judge the effectiveness of Meta’s announced tools, policies and actions.”\n\nMeta said in shareholder documents that it had made a series of efforts to protect young users, and that issuing an annual report on the matter would be “unnecessary”.\n\nHowever, ISS said the company “continues to experience controversies related to child safety” and that “shareholders would benefit from additional information on how the company is managing the risks”.\n\nGlass Lewis said: “We do not believe that the company has provided sufficient disclosure to demonstrate to shareholders that these risks will be managed by the company, nor do we have any reason to be assured that the company will act proactively rather than reactively.”\n\nStory continues\n\nISS and Glass Lewis’ recommendations are influential because they often determine how fund managers and other institutional shareholders vote.\n\nEarlier this month the EU opened an investigation into whether Facebook and Instagram have potentially addictive effects on children. The company says it has dozens of tools to make social media safer.\n\nIn the UK, the company is facing new online safety laws as well as ongoing opposition to its plans to introduce encryption to Facebook and Instagram’s messaging services.",

        "content": "Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's Time to Shine: Beating the S&P, But for How Long?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nDespite the rampant market volatility, the technology sector has long delivered superior returns compared to the broader market equities. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year, boasting an impressive 31.2% return compared to the S&P 500 index’s 28%.\n\nTech stocks have long been hailed as the champions of the stock market, with the Magnificent Seven stocks delivering stellar yet consistent performance. For instance, shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are up over 88% over the past year, while the AI-pioneer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has surged by over 210% over this period.\n\nThe generative AI boom has continued to create a buzz, with Big Tech companies aggressively incorporating AI into their products and services to stay ahead in a market projected to exceed $1 trillion in revenue within the next decade.\n\nTech's Lackluster Performance as Headwinds Pile On\n\nWhile the long-term performance of tech stocks has been spectacular, the increasing economic turmoil has caused them to lose their spark. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's\n\nOver the past month, the tech sector fund saw a decline of 5.82%, mirroring the broader tech market’s struggles, as the S&P 500 gained 5.2%. Over the three-month period, XLK slipped by 0.55% while the S&P 500 advanced by 4.4%.\n\nTech giants are currently dealing with significant upheaval, causing their stocks to underperform despite posting better-than-expected earnings. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is currently in the middle of a major restructuring, while Meta Platform predicts a slowing growth trajectory in the upcoming quarters, causing its shares to drop by about 3% over the past three months.\n\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is dealing with mass layoffs, price cuts and disappointing earnings results as the company reported the largest year-over-year revenue decline since 2012 for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nPersistent Inflation Woes\n\nThe tenacious inflation rates and delayed rate cuts have also caused investors to pull out of tech stocks lately. The release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from their April 30 to May 1 policy meeting added to the market’s jitters, as it revealed a stark lack of progress in recent months toward curbing inflation.\n\n\"Participants observed that while inflation had eased over the past year, in recent months, there had been a lack of further progress toward the Committee's 2% objective,\" the summary concluded, \"The recent monthly data had showed significant increases in components of both goods and services price inflation.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimism Amidst Volatility\n\nDespite the recent sell-off, some analysts remain bullish on Big Tech. Barclays, for instance, continues to have a positive outlook on the sector.\n\n\"Big Tech fundamentals still look good here, and we think there's room to run over the next couple of quarters, even though the bar for the group to deliver has been set very high. Big Tech revisions have strengthened further post-Q1 earnings, bifurcating even more from the rest of the S&P 500,\" said Venu Krishna, strategist at Barclays.\n\nFurthermore, NVIDIA Corp’s strong earnings report took the market by storm, as shares of the AI-chipmaker crossed $1,000 for the first time on May 22. The company's better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report, coupled with its 10-for-1 stock split announcement, has taken the market by storm, driving the Nasdaq Composite to hit a fresh high on May 23.\n\nAdd a Little Stability to Your Portfolio\n\nWhile some analysts believe tech stocks still have room to grow, others speculate that a major correction could be in the near future. Diversifying your portfolio with income generating assets can help you weather a market downturn by providing consistent cashflow regardless of which direction stocks are heading. One extremely popular option right now is private credit, particularly private credit backed by real estate. Two trusted options are the Arrived Private Credit Fund and Basecamp Alpine Notes.\n\nThe Arrived Private Credit Fund simplifies investing in short-term financing for real estate projects, providing attractive yields secured by quality residential real estate. With target annualized dividends of 7-9%, quarterly liquidity, and a diversified pool of real estate-backed loans, this fund is an excellent complement to equity investing.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\n\nBasecamp Alpine Notes from EquityMultiple offer another powerful short-term cash management tool, with a target APY of 9.00% over a 3-month term and a minimum investment of only $1,000. These notes provide high liquidity and compelling rates with compounding interest, making them an ideal choice for investors looking to build their income-generating portfolio. As a special offer, Basecamp Alpine Notes are exclusive to first-time investors on the EquityMultiple platform, giving new investors a unique opportunity to take advantage of these favorable terms.\n\nClick here for more details about Basecamp Alpine Notes.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks That Could Be Millionaire-Makers: May Edition",
        "content": "As an expression of the digital age, the metaverse comes in many forms depending on investor focus. One could view it as supplemented or displaced reality via augmented reality/virtual reality headsets like Meta Platform’s (NASDAQ:META) Oculus Quest or Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro. As we delve deeper into this realm, identifying promising metaverse stocks to buy becomes crucial. The app ecosystem, which forms the baseline for metaverse content, offers numerous opportunities for savvy investors to capitalize on this evolving market.\n\nMetaverse could also be viewed as the totality of different components. In addition to augmented reality, it would bring in tradeable digital assets from various blockchain networks. This would form a new layer of the economy conducted in virtual space.\n\nOn top of it, artificial intelligence (AI) agents would then bring an additional layer of immersion for people to interact with e-commerce, gaming and social networking. According to a Mordor Intelligence report, the metaverse market size is about $116 billion in 2024. By 2029, it is forecasted to grow by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41.83% to $670 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is, which are the metaverse stocks to buy that will power this growth to the benefit of shareholders?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a chipmaker in competition with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is seldom viewed as a metaverse stock. However, if this market is to gain mass adoption, AMD will play a key role.\n\nKnown for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) that are also competitively priced, AMD is now pushing accelerated processing units (APUs) further. These chips combine both central processing and parallel graphics in a single package. Since the introduction of Fusion APU in 2011, these chips now rival modern gaming consoles with the Ryzen 8000G series.\n\nIn other words, AMD is opening the way for cheap mini PCs that don’t require expensive and bulky discrete GPUs. In that capacity, AMD is creating all-purpose computing platforms which is exactly what the baseline metaverse layer would need.\n\nInterestingly, the financial markets have shown a mixed reaction to AMD’s innovations and market positioning. Over the last year, AMD’s stock increased by around 66%, reflecting investor optimism about its role in emerging technologies. However, Nvidia saw a substantial rise of around 188% largely due to its dominance in AI technologies. AMD, on the other hand, has not gained as much traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is releasing Kraken APUs next year as the next level of performance on 4 nanometer (nm) chip nodes. In the meantime, AMD is heading against Nvidia on the AI front as well with the more cost-effective MI300X chips. Most importantly for investors, Nvidia stole the AI spotlight, leaving AMD stock somewhat underutilized.\n\nAt the present price of $166.33, AMD stock is still far from its all-time high of $227.30 this past March. One-year consensus price targets place AMD shares at $192.56, indicating a potential for a $265 per share ceiling.\n\nUnity Software (U) A developer works on a 3D racing game in the Unity engine on a laptop.\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile AMD, Intel and Nvidia provide the hardware components for metaverse blocks, Unity Software (NYSE:U) is the dominant software platform to create metaverse content. Its Unity Engine is widely used across mobile, console and desktop computers due to easily accessible development tools and a vast library of online tutorials.\n\nAccording to a 6sense survey, Unity holds 27% market share in the game development category. For comparison, the Unreal Engine from privately-held Epic Games, holds 16% market share.\n\nFollowing the departure of Unity CEO John Riccitiello last October, the company is yet to balance its licensing monetization approach. On May 9, Unity delivered its first-quarter earnings. Despite a net loss of $291 million, the bulk went into restructuring costs ($212 million) and convertible notes ($61 million).\n\nIn that light, Unity’s net loss would have only accounted for $141 million. That is a significant improvement over last year’s $254 million net loss. Moving forward, much is expected of Unity 6 for easier multiplatform deployment and AI tools.\n\nOn the monetization front, developers can take advantage of Unity’s integrated Unity Ads and ironSource Ads platform. Unity gets a cut from any deals. On that progress to profitability, Unity Software holds $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents.\n\nFor metaverse investors, this translates to buying on the weakness, which typically provides the greatest profit potential long-term. Given these factors, Unity Software emerges as a compelling choice among metaverse stocks to buy. Year-to-date, U stock is down 45%. At the present price of $21.27, U shares are far removed from their all-time high of $201.12 in November 2021. Nasdaq’s average U price target is $29.05 per share.\n\nVuzix (VUZI) Vuzix (VUZI) branded AR glasses\n\nSource: zixia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere have been many attempts at unassuming AR glasses, but Vuzix (NASDAQ:VUZI) appears to have hit the sweet spot with Vuzix Z100. Revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024, these smart glasses can embed prescription lenses and run for two days on a single charge. As investors explore metaverse stocks to buy, Vuzix offers intriguing potential due to its innovative products and ongoing projects.\n\nThe glasses are designed as workflow augmentation rather than immersion. Vuzix built upon three decades of extended reality (XR) experience to develop them. Still a penny stock, Vuzix delivered a net loss of $10.048 million in Q1 2024, in line with the year-ago quarter at $10.241 million.\n\nGiven the reduced sales of M400 glasses, the company saw a 52% decline in revenue. Yet, Vuzix remains positive for the near future with “several new projects with new and existing defense and consumer product-focused customers” during 2024.\n\nSimilar to China’s adoption of smart glasses in law enforcement, the same trend is likely to unfold in the U.S. VUZI stock is down 25% year-to-date. At $1.60 per share, VUZI shares are now 19x lower from the all-time high of $30.57 in April 2021. Yet, the average VUZI price target is nearly double at $3 per share.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+87.0% vs. +44.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.

AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives.\r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world.

The company is a reliable player in the energy sector, boasts a resilient capital structure and a track record of prudent capex management. Its strategic discoveries in the Stabroek Block and Permian Basin promise growth and lower greenhouse gas intensity.\r\n\r\nWith a robust balance sheet, ExxonMobil prioritizes shareholder returns, evidenced by substantial buybacks and the strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company aims to increase its annual share buybacks to $20 billion through 2025.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges loom, notably in the upstream operations, which are susceptible to volatile oil prices and regulatory hurdles. While committed to shareholders, ExxonMobil faces scrutiny for lagging industry peers in terms of dividend yield. Reliance on finding economically recoverable reserves and exposure to OPEC production cuts add to uncertainties.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of HF Foods have underperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $165.72 million is facing challenges which includes high debt levels, low net profit margins, declining cash flow, and inventory management issues. Dependence on the Asian restaurant market, exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical risks pose concerns.\r\n\r\nThe impact of exiting the chicken processing business and the risks associated with transformation initiatives persist. Nevertheless, HF Foods’ revenues increased 0.6% year over year in first-quarter 2024 despite exiting its chicken processing business in 2023.\r\n\r\nProfitability improved significantly, with net loss narrowing and adjusted EBITDA increasing. Cost control measures, such as centralized purchasing, fleet enhancements, and digital transformation, are driving efficiencies. With a strong liquidity position, HF Foods is well-positioned for strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to expand its footprint.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on HF Foods here >>>)\r\n\r\nBlue Dolphin Energy’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+104.9% vs. +17.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $94.75 million is operating in the strategic Eagle Ford Shale region, offers a robust investment option with its established market presence and considerable infrastructure, including a 15,000-barrel-per-day refinery and more than 1.25 million barrels of storage.\r\n\r\nFinancially, it managed costs effectively, reducing goods sold from $96.2 million in first-quarter 2023 to $79.2 million in first-quarter 2024, and secured a $5-million credit facility for liquidity.\r\n\r\nHowever, risks include heavy reliance on refining margins, which saw first-quarter 2024 revenues drop to $91 million from $116.7 million the previous year, and high customer concentration, with 89% of 2023 revenues from two main customers. Moreover, persistent debt issues, significant default amounts, and concerns over affiliate transactions further cloud its financial stability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Blue Dolphin Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today Philip Morris International Inc.

        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Meta Platforms (META). Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Meta Platforms due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nMETA Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat\n\nMeta reported first-quarter 2024 earnings of $4.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.03%. The company reported earnings of $2.20 per share in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $36.46 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.48% and jumped 27.3% year over year.\r\n\r\nMeta’s top line has been benefiting from the growing integration of AI into its products.

As a percentage of revenues, total costs and expenses were 62.1%, significantly down from 74.8% reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, accounting for 81% of Meta’s overall expenses. FoA expenses were up 7% year over year, primarily due to higher legal and infrastructure costs.\r\n\r\nReality Labs’ expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year over year.\r\n\r\nAs a percentage of revenues, marketing & sales expenses decreased 360 basis points (bps), while general & administrative expenses fell 60 bps on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nResearch & development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 27.4%, down 540 bps on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nMeta’s employee base was 69,329 at the end of the first quarter, down 10% year over year but up 3% sequentially.\r\n\r\nOperating income of $13.82 billion jumped 91.2% year over year. The operating margin was 37.9%, expanding significantly from 25.2% reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nFamily of Apps’ operating income surged 57.4% year over year to $17.7 billion. Reality Labs reported a loss of $3.85 billion compared with the year-ago quarter’s loss of $3.99 billion.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities were $58.12 billion compared with $65.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nLong-term debt was $18.39 billion as of Mar 31, 2024, unchanged sequentially.\r\n\r\nCapital expenditures were $6.72 billion in the first quarter compared with $7.9 billion in the previous quarter.

It continues to expect Reality Labs’ operating losses to increase year over year in 2024.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Meta Platforms has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Meta Platforms has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:META) have discussed licensing content with major Hollywood studios for their AI video generation software.\n\nThese companies are developing technology to create realistic scenes from text prompts and have offered substantial sums to partner with studios.\n\nPeer Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) backed OpenAI is engaged in similar talks, Bloomberg reports.\n\nHollywood studios want to use AI to cut costs but ensure their work isn’t misused. They are cautious about licensing content without control over its use.\n\nRecently, Scarlett Johansson demanded that OpenAI stop using a voice resembling hers for its chatbot.\n\nOn Wednesday, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) (NASDAQ:NWSA) agreed to let OpenAI use content from its publications in a deal potentially worth over $250 million over five years. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) is open to licensing specific programs but not its entire library.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) are interested in other collaborations but not licensing their content.\n\nNew AI tools, like OpenAI’s Sora and Alphabet’s Veo, promise to help filmmakers create vivid clips from text descriptions, causing excitement and anxiety in the industry.\n\nPreviously, the U.S. Big Tech companies and news publishers were at loggerheads over AI’s influence, particularly regarding the unauthorized use of the latter’s content for AI training.\n\nGoogle’s AI search bred concerns for publishers over losing a substantial portion of their Google-generated traffic.\n\nReports indicated Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet committed over $32 billion in AI infrastructure in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nPrice Actions: At the last check Friday, GOOGL shares traded higher by 0.52% at $174.45 premarket.

        "content": "If you’re wondering which stocks to buy for the next economic upturn, you’re in the right place. Finding profitable investment opportunities in the constantly changing global economy is crucial to profiting from the next economic boom. These seven exceptional stocks with solid growth potential and tactical advantages may lead in their respective industries.\n\nThe first one stands out as a strong competitor in the financial industry because of its steady revenue growth and sensible diversification tactics. Driven by strong demand for its cutting-edge GPUs, the second semiconductor company in the market has seen outstanding growth in its data center division.\n\nMeanwhile, the third one is notable for its adaptability and effectiveness in AI applications, and a significant portion of its income comes from AI inference. With its strategic connection to new market trends like the business refresh cycle and AI PCs, the fourth one has a promising future. The sixth one leads on its successful marketing and positive financial outlook; the seventh has its strategic efforts and potential for future growth. Finally, the fifth one has solid financial standing and an emphasis on innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: SoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, adjusted net revenue for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) increased by 26% year-over-year (YOY) to $581 million. It is the 12th straight quarter of a boost of more than 25%. Such stable growth highlights the business’s revenue-generating solid capacities and long-term growth sustainability.\n\nMoreover, SoFi’s fundamental advantage is the diversity of its top-line. In Q1, the combined sectors of financial services and technology platforms held 42% of the adjusted net revenue, up from 33% and 40% in the prior quarters. As reflected in this trend, by 2024’s end, it may attain a nearly equal revenue distribution between these segments and loans, pointing to a strategy move in that direction.\n\nFinally, in Q1, SoFi’s adjusted EBITDA was $144 million, a 91% YOY increase. This growth reflects significant operating leverage, as the EBITDA margin increased to 25% from 16% during Q1 2023. Therefore, the company’s operations are now more scalable and cost-effective.\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Data Center division of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) saw record sales of $2.3 billion, up 2% sequentially and 80% YOY. Instinct MI300X GPU sales acceleration and a double-digit percentage gain in server CPU sales propelled growth. AMD increased its revenue share from server CPUs, especially in cloud and business installations. Indeed, these numbers demonstrate AMD’s dominant position in the data center industry. This is the result of its creative products and calculated market penetration.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the client segment expansion results from a $1.4 billion increase in sales, or 85% YOY. This is driven by the most recent generation of Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. These have seen double-digit growth in desktop Ryzen CPUs and nearly a doubling of sales of mobile Ryzen CPUs YOY. Overall, AMD’s Ryzen CPUs are in high demand, and the client segment has had remarkable growth, demonstrating the success of its product plans.\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: NVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Data Center business area for NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be the engine driving its growth trajectory. This segment’s record sales of $22.6 billion in Q1 2024 were a 427% YOY growth. The main force driving this increase is the broad deployment of the Nvidia Hopper GPU computing platform and AI inference by major cloud providers, businesses, and consumer internet firms.\n\nMoreover, companies like Meta (NASDAQ:META) have invested heavily in Nvidia’s AI infrastructure. Developed on a cluster of 24K H100 GPUs, Meta’s Llama 3 delivers new AI-driven features that increase user engagement and open up new income sources for the company.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has a lot of room to develop in the automotive industry, especially with its AI infrastructure supporting autonomous driving technology. An excellent example is Nvidia’s partnership with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The company powers Tesla’s FSD Version 12 autonomous driving software with its AI infrastructure. In short, Tesla’s installation of 35K H100 GPUs highlights how important Nvidia’s technology is to advancing autonomous car capabilities.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the main factors influencing Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) development potential is its leadership in technology and placement in rising industry trends. Strong future demand for AI PCs is reflected in the projected Enterprise refresh cycle and increased momentum for these devices. This trend is supported by Intel’s expertise in creating and managing the AI PC category and the growing availability of AI PC CPUs.\n\nMoreover, an improvement in the data center industry indicates the return to more regular CPU purchasing patterns and the increasing availability of accelerators. This solidifies the impending release of Intel 18A products.\n\nFurther, Intel anticipates growth in both EPS and sales for 2024, with H2 2024 seeing an acceleration in revenue growth. Strategic measures and rising demand signals underpin this optimistic forecast. Intel’s commitment to providing value is reflected in the announcement of a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share, boosting the Street’s confidence. Despite large expenditures in technology and capacity growth, Intel expects considerable capital offsets in H2 2024, resulting in about neutrally adjusted free cash flow for 2024.\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: ACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) had $288 million in time deposits and cash.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.10 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for META _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +19.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $158.97 billion and $179.82 billion estimates indicate +17.8% and +13.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?",
        "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.1% over the past month. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n31% = US$46b ÷ US$150b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.31 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nMeta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 31% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Meta Platforms has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.4% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Meta Platforms' moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Meta Platforms' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 6.0% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is META fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Meta Platforms Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nMeta Platforms' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 2.8% (implying that it retains 97% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.\n\nLooking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.2% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 23% over the same period.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Meta Platforms' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "content": "Growth stocks have the potential to outperform the stock market due to their growth opportunities. Many of these investments have high valuations that investors justify by looking several years into the future.\n\nSome growth stocks live up to their lofty valuations and accumulate generational returns for early investors. However, other corporations fall flat and destroy shareholder value over several years. It takes a lot of effort to find the right growth stocks, and unfortunately, some people are better off with an index fund.\n\nHowever, there is a middle ground. Some growth stocks have reasonable valuations and compelling growth prospects. These are some of the top undervalued growth stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) is a fast-food restaurant chain that specializes in American steaks. Many restaurant stocks have been soaring in recent months, and Texas Roadhouse is no exception to the run. Its stock is up by 38% year-to-date and has gained 213% over the past five years.\n\nThe stock trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.39% yield. The restaurant chain has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years and has an annualized dividend growth rate of 16.05% over the past decade.\n\nTexas Roadhouse continues to report solid financials that suggest the steakhouse chain can build on its successes. Revenue increased by 12.5% year-over-year (YoY) in Q1 2024, while net income was up by 31.0% YoY. Comparable restaurant sales increased by 8.4% YoY at company restaurants. Franchise restaurant sales grew by 7.7% YoY.\n\nThe company consists of 644 company restaurants and 109 franchise restaurants, bringing the total to 753 restaurants. It’s a 7.0% YoY improvement from last year’s 704 restaurants.\n\nMoody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody’s (NYSE:MCO) is a fintech firm that has been outpacing the stock market. The stock is up by 123% over the past five years and is currently up by 8% year-to-date. Shares trade at a 44 P/E ratio and offer a 0.82% yield. The risk management firm has raised its dividend for 15 consecutive years and has maintained a 12.42% annualized dividend growth rate over the past decade. The quarterly dividend is currently $0.85 per share.\n\nResults from Q1 2024 highlight Moody’s growth. Revenue increased by 21% YoY to reach $1.8 billion. Meanwhile, diluted EPS was up by 16% YoY — $3.15 per share. Moody’s Investors Service segment was a big winner, which showcased 35% YoY revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoody’s is currently rated as a Moderate Buy among 11 analysts. The highest price target of $450 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 8% from current levels.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) checks several boxes as an undervalued growth stock. It trades at a 27 P/E ratio and has impressive financial growth. Revenue increased 27% YoY in the first quarter, while net income surged by 117% YoY. Net income growth is important since it leads to a lower P/E ratio, creating a margin of safety.\n\nThe company has been making big investments in artificial intelligence, but advertising is still the main driver of the growth story. Meta Platforms’ business model lives and dies on advertising, and it’s been vibrant for many years. A 7% YoY increase in daily active users on the company’s social networks suggests ad revenue should continue to grow.\n\nShares are up by 33% year-to-date and up 158% over the past five years. Wall Street analysts believe shares can reach new heights. The average price target suggests a 12% upside from current levels.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) makes it on the list due to an ambitious multi-year growth plan that is coming to fruition. While the company has been unprofitable for several years, the company recently flipped the switch, and profit margins have been expanding rapidly.\n\nSoFi came out of Q1 2024 with a sterling 13.8% net profit margin. It’s a big turnaround and hasn’t come at the cost of growth. Revenue increased by 37% YoY in the quarter, while net income flipped from a $34.4 million net loss in Q1 2023 to a $88.0 million profit in the recent quarter.\n\nThe fintech firm is diversifying its revenue streams beyond lending and is growing in multiple verticals. SoFi now has 8.1 million members, a 44% YoY improvement. The firm added 622,000 members in the quarter. SoFi has been a roller coaster, but the stock is finally presenting a compelling long-term opportunity that can generate meaningful growth in a few years.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) offers growth at a reasonable price. Shares trade at a 19 P/E ratio and are up by 29% year-to-date. The stock has also more than doubled over the past five years and offers a 1.17% yield. Dividend growth has also been solid, and the company recently announced a 17% dividend hike.\n\nThe fintech firm’s status as a dividend growth stock with a respectable yield has attracted investors, but so have its financials. Q1 2024 revenue was 11% higher than the same period last year. Net income was also up by 34% YoY. Higher profit margins and growing revenue should bring down the P/E ratio and make the stock more attractive for patient investors.\n\nThe Q1 earnings report revealed some pleasant news about the company’s long-term opportunities. More than 60% of the company’s new accounts came from Millennials and Gen Z consumers. The firm’s ability to retain consumers from those generations points to more growth in the years ahead.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones.

The company recently issued its first dividend and should have a high growth rate moving forward. Although the yield is low, Alphabet stock has been soaring. It’s up 28% year-to-date and has gained 214% over the past five years.\n\nThe stock has a reasonable valuation and strong momentum, but earnings determine if the gains are meant to last. Luckily for investors, Alphabet reported impressive Q1 2024 results. Revenue increased by 15% YoY, while net income was up by 57% YoY.\n\nAlphabet generates most of its revenue from online advertising. Google and YouTube are two of the most popular websites available, and advanced targeting capabilities make those two platforms great choices for many businesses. However, the company is also expanding its cloud computing segment. Google Cloud now represents more than 10% of the corporation’s total revenue.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) hand using online banking and icon on tablet screen device in coffee shop\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is a Brazilian digital bank with roughly 100 million customers. The stock has a 45 P/E ratio and is up by 41% year-to-date. The online bank boasts high gross profit margins that reached 43.2% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nHigh-profit margins weren’t the only good news from Q1 results. Revenue increased by 69% YoY, while net income soared by 167% compared to the same period last year. Wall Street analysts believe there is more upside to the stock. It’s currently rated as a Strong Buy, with a projected 13% upside.\n\nNu Holdings’ diversified product line includes portfolios, bank accounts, credit cards and other financial products. Revenue and earnings growth have been high for a while, and continued growth can make the valuation easier to justify. While a 45 P/E ratio is higher than most investors may like, the stock also has a more reasonable 27-forward P/E ratio.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SOFI and GOOG.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past 18 months. Shares jumped sixfold thanks to the crucial role it is playing in the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). But Nvidia has also crushed the broader market by a big margin over the past decade as well.\n\nThe stock has shot up over 20,000% in the past 10 years, with these stunning gains crushing the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's 428% jump by an astronomic margin. With an investment of $5,000 made in the stock a decade ago, Nvidia has become a millionaire-maker. NVDA Chart\n\nNot everyone may be comfortable paying 38 times sales and 55 times earnings for Nvidia stock right now, even though it may be able to justify that expensive valuation because of a huge total addressable market worth $1 trillion. Investors looking to buy attractively valued stocks that could make them richer in the long run should instead consider Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Oracle(NYSE: ORCL).\n\nThese companies are not only significantly cheaper than Nvidia, but they are on track to benefit from a couple of massive growth opportunities that could send their share prices soaring over the long term. Let's look at the reasons Meta and Oracle could be ideal picks for investors hoping to construct a million-dollar portfolio.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms stock shot up 92% in the past year, and the company's recent quarterly report indicates that it is built for more upside because of its accelerating growth. The social media giant's first-quarter revenue increased 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, while adjusted earnings shot up 114% year over year to $4.71 per share.\n\nMeta's impressive year-over-year growth was driven by a solid 20% year-over-year jump in ad impressions, as well as a 6% jump in the average price of each ad. AI is playing an important role in driving stronger growth in Meta's ad business by delivering relevant content to users across its family of apps, which is in turn driving an increase in the number of relevant ads served to its users.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's April earnings conference call that its AI recommendation system accounts for 30% of the posts that are delivered to the Facebook feeds of its users, while more than 50% of the content on Instagram is recommended by AI. It is worth noting that Meta has been continuously introducing AI-related tools for advertisers, making it easier for them to create and optimize ad campaigns.\n\nThe company will be rolling out more generative AI tools as the year progresses to help advertisers improve the performance of their ads and allow them to boost the returns on the ad dollars that they spend. The good part is that advertisers are already reaping the benefits of Meta's AI tools. In January this year, a Meta executive said that AI is driving a 32% increase in returns on advertising spending for advertisers while helping them reduce acquisition costs by 17%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased upon this performance, Meta Platforms is forecasting another quarter of solid growth. The company expects Q2 revenue to land at $37.8 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be an 18% jump over the year-ago period when it reported 11% top-line growth. Even better, analysts are forecasting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 30% for the next five years, which would be an acceleration over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see Meta delivering such impressive growth as AI is helping it corner a bigger share of the digital ad market. Digital ad spending is forecasted to grow 13.2% in 2024, and Meta's Q1 growth and Q2 forecast tells us that it is growing at a faster pace than the end market. More importantly, digital ad spending is expected to increase at an annual rate of 14.5% through 2030, according to KBV Research, generating an annual revenue of just over $1 trillion.\n\nMeta generated $143 billion in revenue in the past 12 months, which means that it still has a lot of room for growth in the future. Investors would do well to buy Meta stock while it is trading at 27 times trailing earnings, which is significantly lower than Nvidia's trailing earnings multiple. Its stronger earnings growth could reward investors with more upside.\n\n2. Oracle\n\nThe demand for cloud-based AI services has been booming as companies across the globe are looking to develop AI applications, and this has turned out to be a boon for Oracle. The company, which made its name by providing database software, is now witnessing solid growth in its cloud computing business.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Feb. 29, 2024), Oracle reported a 25% year-over-year increase in cloud revenue to $5.1 billion. The segment's growth outpaced the company's overall revenue increase of 7% to $13.3 billion. More specifically, the demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure shot up and its revenue from this niche jumped 49% year over year to $1.8 billion.\n\nThe good thing for Oracle investors is that AI has helped the company build a healthy revenue pipeline. This was evident from the 29% year-over-year increase in the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) last quarter, a metric that refers to the total value of future contracts that Oracle has to fulfill. The fact that this metric increased at a faster pace than Oracle's revenue is a positive sign.\n\nOracle pointed out that it has been \"receiving large contracts reserving cloud infrastructure capacity because the demand for our Gen2 AI infrastructure substantially exceeds supply.\" The company has been bringing new cloud data centers online very rapidly to cater to the healthy demand that it has been witnessing, so it won't be surprising to see the company's cloud AI-focused revenue pipeline improving further in the future.\n\nThe cloud AI market is forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 31% through the end of the decade, generating an annual revenue of $398 billion at the end of the forecast period, according to Fortune Business Insights. As a result, there is a good chance that Oracle's growth could accelerate over the long run. Analysts, for instance, are expecting Oracle's earnings growth to accelerate over the next couple of years as compared to the $5.12 per share in earnings it delivered in fiscal 2023. ORCL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nConsidering that Oracle is currently trading at 6.6 times sales and 20 times forward earnings, investors can buy it at a much cheaper valuation compared to Nvidia. That could turn out to be a smart move -- the terrific opportunity for Oracle in the cloud AI market could translate into stronger earnings growth in the long run and lead the market to reward the stock with more gains. Investors wanting to add a cloud stock to their portfolios that could help them attain their goal of becoming millionaires would do well to buy Oracle right away.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement",
        "content": "Alongside its latest earnings results, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10:1 stock split and a 150% dividend raise following the market closed on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia shares, now the ninth most expensive in the S&P 500, opened above $1,000 a day after the print. A 10:1 split would imply a $100/share price, all else being equal, after trading opens on Monday, June 10th.\n\nThis year, eight companies announced stock splits, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in January and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) in March. The surge in Big Tech share prices prompted four splits among the ‘Magnificent 7’ mega-cap stocks since 2022, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making shares more accessible. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) split in 2020, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are nearing the $500/share threshold.\n\n“S&P 500 stocks with share prices over $500 represent $7.4tn in market cap, or about 16% of the index,” Bank of America analysts said in a Thursday note.\n\nIn their recently updated research, BofA found that stock splits are typically bullish for companies that enact them. On average, returns one year post-split are 25%, compared to around 12% for the broader market.\n\n“Splits seem to be bullish across market regimes, something management teams might consider if shares look too expensive for buybacks,” analysts wrote.\n\nWhen comparing the distribution of stock split returns relative to the S&P 500, it can be seen that a few strong companies often improve average performance. For instance, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) gained 56% in the 12 months following its October 2022 split announcement, while Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) rose 39% after declaring its split in August 2022, BofA highlighted.\n\nGiven that gains are more common and typically larger than losses, stock splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets. For example, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Valero experienced strong performance after their split announcements, regardless of their prior trading behavior.\n\nHowever, outperformance is not guaranteed, BofA’s team cautions. Roughly 30% of stocks see negative returns 12 months post-split, with an average decline of 22%. While splits may indicate strong momentum, companies can still struggle in a challenging macro environment.\n\n“Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked. Amazon is a good example of how stocks can recover, however, and was up 26% in the 24 months after its split announcement,” the firm noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent NVDA shareholders will receive 10 shares for every share they own today, while the market capitalization of the AI giant will remain unchanged.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement\n\nExclusive-KKR set for unconditional EU antitrust okay for Telecom Italia deal, sources say\n\nWorkday shares dive 12% on lowered subscription revenue outlook\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia's First Quarter Results Confirm That The Next Industrial Revolution Is Well Underway\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported its fiscal first quarter results, surpassing both top and bottom-line estimates as demand for AI chips remains as robust as ever. Nvidia sales continue to skyrocket as Google, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft-backed OpenAI spend billions of dollars to buy its graphics processing units to develop and deploy generative AI applications. During extended trading on Wednesday, Nvidia shares rose 7% and surpassed $1,000 for the first time.\n\nImpressive Fiscal First Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 28th, Nvidia reported that revenue grew262% YoY as it amounted to $26.04 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $24.65 billion. Data center alone reported a revenue rise of 427% YoY to $22.6 billion, with large cloud providers like Google, Microsoft and Amazon contributing about mid-40%. Meta Platforms and its announcement of Lama 3, their latest large language model which used 24,000 H100 GPUs, was the highlight of Nvidia’s reported quarter.\n\nNetworking revenue grew more than three times compared to last year’s comparable quarter to $3.2 billion, owed primarily to InfiniBand products. Gaming revenue grew 18% to $2.65 billion.Although a much smaller business, Nvidia also makes chips for cars and advanced graphics workstations. Professional visualization brought in $427 million with $329 million in automotive sales.\n\nNet income amounted to $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share, skyrocketing from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $2 billion.\n\nAn Even More Impressive Outlook\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for sales of $28 billion. Later this year, Nvidia expects even more revenue growth from its next-generation AI chip, with Blackwell expected to unlock a new growth phase for the AI chip leader. Financial Times reported earlier this week Amazon is eagerly waiting for Nvidia's newest superchip.\n\nNvidia expected a blockbuster quarter and it was just as impressive as anticipated. Although Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all stated that they intend to be less reliant on Nvidia’s chips as they plan to spend $200 billion this year on chips and data centers they need to train and operate their AI systems, they are not there year. Nvidia’s results have become the most important event on the macroeconomic calendar. It’s no exaggeration to say that its quarterly reports have become an indicator of strength of the AI boom that is not showing any signs of slowing down as AI seems to be the new commodity, marking a new era and the next industrial revolution. The new AI era began with Nvidia and by the looks of it, it is just getting started as CEO Jensen Huang assured that demand for both Hopper and Blackwell is way ahead of supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Why Ticketmaster Owner Live Nation's Shares Are Tumbling Today\n\nLive Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares are trading lower on Thursday as the company faces a legal challenge after the U.S. Department of Justice and several states prepare to file an antitrust lawsuit against the entertainment giant over its control of concert ticket sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the case, which is expected to be filed in the Southern District of New York on Thursday, could lead to the company’s breakup.\n\nThe lawsuit targets Live Nation’s dominance in the ticketing market through its subsidiary Ticketmaster.\n\nThis lawsuit is part of the Biden administration’s broader strategy to tackle monopolistic practices in various industries.\n\nThe Justice Department has already initiated legal actions against tech giants like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), while the Federal Trade Commission is pushing for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). to divest its Instagram and WhatsApp units and has sued Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for monopolistic practices in the online marketplace.\n\nFollowing the news of the impending lawsuit, Live Nation’s shares fell, highlighting investor concerns over the potential outcomes of the legal action.\n\nLive Nation, the largest concert promoter in the United States, merged with Ticketmaster in 2010. The merger was initially approved under the Obama administration with conditions designed to prevent anticompetitive practices.\n\nHowever, under the Trump administration, the Justice Department found that Live Nation had violated these conditions, leading to a modified settlement in 2019 that included the appointment of an external monitor to oversee compliance.\n\nThe Biden administration launched a new investigation into Live Nation in 2022, prompted by ongoing concerns about the company’s adherence to the settlement terms.\n\nPublic interest in the case surged after Ticketmaster struggled to handle the overwhelming demand for Taylor Swift concert tickets later that year, bringing further scrutiny to Live Nation’s practices.\n\nLive Nation stock has gained more than 23% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows in May",
        "content": "It’s been an incredible year for growth stocks. As measured by the Nasdaq 100 Index, growth stocks have rallied 35% over the past 12 months. And starting from the Fall 2022 lows, the Nasdaq 100 has now rallied more than 70% in total. But investors haven’t completely missed out on easy money with these growth stocks at 52-week lows.\n\nCertainly, valuations have gotten rather stretched in a lot of leading areas like AI and semiconductor manufacturers. However, even amid this seemingly non-stop tech stock bull market, there are still some bargains to be found.\n\nIn fact, all three of these growth stocks to buy now are currently at or just above their 52-week lows. While these companies are currently reporting downbeat earnings and are in something of a cyclical trough, these three growth stocks have what it takes to get back on track and see their shares post major recoveries in the back half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCisco (CSCO) Where and Why You Can Steal Cisco Stock\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a leading communications technology company.\n\nMost investors probably know Cisco for its internet networking gear, such as routers and network switching systems. And to be sure, communications hardware remains a large chunk of Cisco’s business.\n\nHowever, Cisco has evolved its operations fairly dramatically in recent years. It has transitioned to a far more subscription-driven recurring revenue model. Increasingly, Cisco layers on higher value-added software and services such as cybersecurity on top of its networking gear.\n\nAs a result, Cisco’s overall business quality has significantly improved. Its revenue streams are more consistent and predictable, and subscription revenues tend to deliver higher profit margins as well.\n\nIn the near-term, hardware sales are down sharply as customers are still absorbing networking equipment bought over the past two years. This has caused CSCO stock to fall to 52-week lows.\n\nShares are a bargain here. Hidden in the negative headlines, in the most recent quarter, Cisco grew total annualized recurring revenues 22% year-over-year to $29.2 billion. Its recent acquisition of Splunk offers Cisco an attractive quickly-growing source of subscription revenues.\n\nNetworking gear is still a cyclical industry and Cisco is currently near the bottom of the cycle. But the company’s long-term outlook remains healthy. With the sell-off, shares go for less than 13 times forward earnings and offer a 3.4% dividend yield.\n\nEndava (DAVA) The logo for Endava (DAVA) displayed on an office building.\n\nSource: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nEndava (NYSE:DAVA) is an IT consulting shop with a focus on financial services businesses such as insurance, banks and payments processors.\n\nThe core business model at Endava is to provide IT services via outsourcing. Essentially, Endava hires skilled IT workers in lower cost-of-living countries such as Poland, Colombia and Vietnam and uses this workforce to fulfill IT contracts for multinational companies.\n\nEndava has enjoyed tremendous success with this business model. It has tripled revenues and increased profitability dramatically in recent years. In particular, Endava saw outsized growth during the early days of the pandemic as firms rushed to beef up their digital offerings for the rush of e-commerce and app-based financial offerings that took off during this period.\n\nThat digital gold rush has now ended. As the economy reopened, the velocity of new IT and digital evolution spending has slowed. Given Endava’s specific focus on the financial services industry, its clients have been especially hard-hit by the recent jitters in the banking and payments sectors.\n\nAll this has resulted in a full-on collapse in DAVA stock, with shares falling more than 80% peak-to-trough. That’s pretty remarkable given that Endava’s revenues have barely slipped from prior levels and analysts see Endava delivering record top-line results for the fiscal year ending June 2025. This makes DAVA stock a fantastic buy near its all-time low stock price.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen. Growth stocks at 52-week lows\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is one of the two primary third-party graphics engines that video game developers use to produce their games.\n\nThe company’s calling card is its interoperability. Unity is plug-and-play. A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly port it across PC, console, mobile and even virtual and augmented reality.\n\nThat last point is a key part of Unity’s appeal. Unity is one of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) primary partners in developing apps for the Apple Vision Pro. Unity is also integral to Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) Oculus ecosystem.\n\nWhile Unity’s technical chops are not in question, the company’s commercial strategy has been less pleasing. Unity has relied heavily on advertising within mobile games to drive revenue, this is a relatively low-quality revenue stream that analysts are nervous about. Unity attempted to raise prices on developers last year, but this caused a firestorm and was walked back.\n\nThat misstep led to Unity’s CEO exiting the company. Matthew Bromberg, a longtime gaming industry executive, comes in as the new Unity head. Fresh leadership and increasing opportunities in the AR/VR arena and the metaverse could be just the thing to help Unity rebound from its current 52-week-low stock price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U and DAVA stock.

        "content": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Steve Cohen's latest portfolio to see some of his top AI stock picks.\n\nSince Meta Platforms ranks 8th in our list of the 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen, the stock deserves a detailed look.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen is one of the few hedge fund managers who almost always dazzles with his outperformance and prescient bets. Cohen, who also owns The New York Mets, founded SAC Capital back in 1992, and since then through 2009 lost money only once. A Bloomberg report earlier this year said that Point72 Asset Management has been able to raise so much cash recently that it's starting to decline external money. The fund has reportedly raised about about $12.8 billion since 2020.\n\nPoint72's main fund returned about 11% in 2023, and 12% in the previous year.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management runs a highly diversified portfolio. As of the end of the March quarter, the portfolio's net worth was over $41.2 billion, with tech stocks accounting for 17% of the total portfolio.\n\nUnlike long-term value investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, Cohen moves with speed and adapts quickly. He's been like this for decades. When he was in Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he would often skip classes to watch stock movements at a local brokerage. He took pride in predicting stock movements based on their direction. Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen\n\nCohen Wants Macro Teams at Point72\n\nCohen, worth over $19 billion, is yet again adapting to the quickly changing global financial landscape as investors demand steady returns. Earlier this year, it was reported that Cohen and his team is expanding macro teams at Point72 as the global economy resets to the new era of high interest rates. The report said that the fund would establish as many as 51 macro trading teams.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nSteve Cohen's Q1'2024 Stake: $102,706,483\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen decreased  his fund's stake in Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by 79% in the first quarter of 2024, ending the period with an $102.7 million stake in Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is deploying AI in its backend systems and algorithms to increase engagement and growth. We talked in detailed about how Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is leveraging AI in our article titled Is Meta Platforms the Best AI Stock Pick of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller?\n\nUBS recently published a report recommending some AI stocks to buy that would benefit from the estimate rise in spending on AI. UBS believes AI adoption is still in its early stage with just about 5% companies using generative AI. However, the firm expects AI monetization and usage to rise dramatically in the future. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks UBS recommended to investors to ride the AI boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\nBillionaire Cohen likes Meta Platforms but it's not his top AI pick.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Buying These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks. Should You Buy Too?",
        "content": "Keeping tabs on what billionaire hedge fund managers do is a great way to check your investment strategy. While blindly following them isn't advisable, seeing what they're doing and checking that against your own thoughts is a good way of seeing if you're on the same page, especially when there's a hot trend like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe 13F filings for Q1 were recently released, revealing some common themes across hedge funds. While many stocks were bought, one is a clear favorite.\n\nAlphabet was a common purchase among all three hedge funds\n\nI'll focus on three hedge funds: Tiger Global Management, Soros Fund Management, and Bridgewater Associates. These funds are run by billionaires Chase Coleman, George Soros, and Ray Dalio, respectively. In Q1, all three of these funds had sizable purchases of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). For Bridgewater and Tiger, Alphabet was the most purchased stock in Q1.\n\nThis is a large nod of confidence to Alphabet, especially since many saw it struggle to roll out AI products initially. However, its Gemini generative AI technology has dramatically improved and is now starting to integrate AI into search results to summarize what you've searched for. Many investors have been waiting for Alphabet to announce this technology, and now that it has, it reinforces the fact that Alphabet is a top player in the tech world.\n\nBut that wasn't the only AI stock these hedge funds were buying.\n\nBridgewater also bought Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). While Tiger Global didn't buy any of these stocks in Q1, it's already heavily exposed, as Meta and Nvidia make up nearly 20% and 5% of its portfolio, respectively. As a result, it shouldn't be surprising that Tiger didn't add any more of these stocks due to its hefty concentration already. Soros Fund Management doesn't own either of these companies, but it isn't as tech-heavy as the other two.\n\nMeta is similar to Alphabet in that its primary business is advertising. So to improve its standing in this field, Meta has rolled out generative AI tools to advertisers, and is also starting to develop its own chips to process its AI workloads.\n\nNvidia hardly needs any introduction in the AI world, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are at the core of training and processing AI models. Despite its massive rise already, Nvidia continues to see incredibly strong demand, which will continue until all AI infrastructure is built.\n\nWith billionaires buying these three stocks, investors might be prompted to buy them now. However, these stocks were purchased between the start of the year and March 31, so it has been nearly two months since this activity occurred. So are they still buys now?\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta and Alphabet are still reasonably priced stocks\n\nAll three of these businesses are mature companies undergoing drastic changes. So I'll use their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to value them, because it considers the business shifts occurring. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNvidia trades at a healthy premium to Meta and Alphabet simply because it's rapidly growing and has the potential to do that for many years. This makes Nvidia one of the harder stocks to assess on the stock market.\n\nAlphabet and Meta trade at much more reasonable valuations and only hold slight premiums to the broader S&P 500's forward P/E of 21.6.Still, each posted solid earnings growth in Q1 (Alphabet's earnings per share rose 62%, while Meta's rose 120%), so they are on the right track.\n\nOf the three, Alphabet and Meta are probably the biggest no-brainer buys. They are executing at a high level and can be purchased at a reasonable price. Nvidia requires more work, and investors must understand the expectations built into the stock, as they are quite high. But it may still be a viable option for investors to scoop up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

According to the CPI report, both core and headline inflation figures are trending downward. Consequently, hopes that the Federal Reserve will eventually start cutting interest rates are improving.\n\nLower interest rates generally have positive implications for the stock market. They reduce borrowing costs, allowing leveraged trading at cheaper rates. Investors also tend to take on more risk during periods of lower interest rates.\r\n\r\nThis partly explains why growth stocks often outperform when central banks are poised to cut interest rates. While the overall stock market typically rises as monetary easing allows more cash flows into equities, some sectors and specific stocks are more likely to outperform.\r\n\r\nTech has led the stock market higher this week, helping the Nasdaq hit a new record. Tech companies in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) spectrum could benefit going forward. However, we should also explore other stocks to build a diversified portfolio that delivers returns that can exceed the broader market.\n\nSince it is rather gratifying as a trader to achieve market-beating returns, three such stocks to buy are named below:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCarnival (CCL) Cruise ship Carnival Conquest docked at port Willemstad on sunset. Cruise stocks.\n\nSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile cruise lines may not traditionally be seen as fast-growing sectors, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) is one of the top stocks to buy for investors with an appetite for recovery plays.\n\nAs the largest cruise line company, Carnival faced immense challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, with over $34.5 billion in accumulated debt. However, lower interest rates could make debt servicing more affordable, increasing the company’s overall value. Furthermore, reduced borrowing costs may stimulate demand for cruise vacations as consumers feel more comfortable using credit cards.\n\nThe Carnival stock currently trades well into growth territory. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 50.3x as the company recovers from losses. While Carnival slowly returns to profitability with four consecutive EPS beats, its stock price has yet to match earnings growth.\n\nDespite paying no dividends, analysts believe the Carnival stock is undervalued relative to earnings growth potential — the consensus price target points to a 25% upside to an average of $20.82 per share.\n\nTradeweb Markets (TW) Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background. Fintech Stock Bargains\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroN\n\nThe online trading platform Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW) is one of the go-to stocks to buy for Wall Street professionals looking to trade stocks, bonds, commodities, or any other asset. Bond trading volumes increased 70% year-over-year (YoY) in April.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates and a potential resurgence in meme stocks driven by retail traders could boost already high volumes and continued market share gains. The company’s high profit margin of 28.5% is indicative of strong pricing power likely to benefit further from interest rate cuts in the near future.\r\n\r\nWith a 59x P/E ratio, the Tradeweb stock is considered a growth stock that pays a small dividend of 0.4%. Similar to many well-known tech stocks, Tradeweb saw 32% earnings growth in the first quarter.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about the company’s EPS growth exceeding 30% this quarter as it continues expanding into different asset classes and regions. In comparison, the S&P 500 is expected to grow only 6.6%.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn AI company could not be missing from a list of stocks to buy as inflation slows down. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is an interesting option to consider. While the company spooked investors earlier this year with plans to invest heavily in AI research and development (R&D), this strategy could fuel substantial long-term growth.\n\nLarge capital expenditures pose risks for the bottom line during times of high interest rates. However, borrowing costs will reduce if inflation decreases and interest rates fall soon. Subsequently, returns on Meta’s AI investments will increase as consumers have more disposable income.\r\n\r\nMeta generates massive free cash flow (FCF) each year, adding $44 billion to its coffers in 2023 alone. While the company has started paying dividends and conducting share buybacks, significant growth upside potential remains.\n\nTrading at a P/E ratio of 27x, Meta stock appears attractively valued relative to other growth stocks. Its current valuation is well below its historical P/E average of 37.1x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The Nasdaq roared to a record high earlier this year, confirming the presence of a bull market. But it didn't stop there. The index continues to climb, just recently reaching yet another new high as investors pile into technology stocks and other growth players. This is great, but if you're looking to buy tech stocks, you might be wondering if valuations have become too lofty.\n\nI've got good news for you: There still are plenty of solid bargains out there, including certain stocks that have missed out on the rally as well as some that have led the gains. Two of these are looking particularly cheap right now considering their long-term potential, making them fantastic buys.\n\nLet's check out two stocks to buy hand over fist while the price is right. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMany of us know Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) very well for one good reason: We use its apps every day to communicate with family, friends, or colleagues. Meta is the world's leading social media company, operating Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of these platforms every day.\n\nWhy is this important? Because it's the key to Meta's billion-dollar sales. The company makes the lion's share of its revenue through advertising, and advertisers choose Meta because they know they can reach so many people on its apps. In the most recent quarter, advertising brought in $35 billion in revenue for the company.\n\nMeta has been able to translate this into earnings growth, and the tech company is doing so well, it even launched its first-ever dividend earlier this year.\n\nNow, one big move could keep Meta ahead, and that's the company's investment in artificial intelligence (AI). It has built and is training its own large language models to power innovations such as AI assistants to help users of all of its apps get things done -- from leisure activities to professional tasks. It's starting out with the recently released Meta AI assistant.\n\nThis could keep users coming back more frequently and spending more time on its apps, which should keep advertisers coming back, too. That makes Meta, trading for 23 times forward earnings estimates today, look like an absolute steal -- especially considering we're in the early days of a potential AI revolution.\n\n2. Intel\n\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC) has reached a turning point in its story. The company is the leader in central processing units (CPUs), the main elements that power computers, but it fell behind in the high-growth area of AI. That weighed on earnings potential and its share price in recent years.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Intel has made AI a priority and just recently announced the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, its most powerful chip ever. Gaudi 3 even has outperformed market leader Nvidia's H100, and at a lower price, so the company could start to turn some heads -- and gain market share. Though Nvidia aims to release an even more powerful chip later this year, Intel's product still could appeal to many potential customers that don't necessarily need the fastest chip out there.\n\nOn top of Intel's focus on AI, the company also is making another big move that could drive growth over the long term. It is opening up its manufacturing to others, aiming to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030.\n\nThe company started last year with one customer for its 18A process, and by the end of the first quarter of this year, announced a total of six. Foundry operations could be a huge revenue driver for Intel over time because, as the only such operation in the U.S., it could win over many North American customers that might like the idea of working with a foundry close to home.\n\nToday, Intel shares trade for only 28 times forward earnings estimates, a terrific entry point for a company about to potentially enter a major new wave of growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 Tantalizing Tech Stocks to Take a Position in Before June",
        "content": "If you’re looking to take a new position in your portfolio in tech stocks, there’s no time like the present. In fact, perhaps you’re a little late to the game. But late is better than never when it comes to finding the top tech stocks to buy.\n\nTech stocks are driving the stock market and have done so for the last year. The growth of generative AI launched a revolution in tech stocks, as many companies are looking for new ways to incorporate AI in their platforms.\n\nFor tech stocks, there’s a lot more to consider than just AI. Tech stocks also represent companies that are involved in hardware, software, cybersecurity, renewable energy technology and communications.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are companies that must be consistently innovating and growing to stay ahead of the curve. And that could lead to significant returns for investors.\n\nTech stocks are appealing because the companies they represent are deft at adapting and pivoting in response to market demands and technological advancements. While they can sometimes be volatile, top tech stocks trend higher over the long term, so it makes sense to take a new position in some top-rated names.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader is our guide in finding the best tech stocks to buy, based on their earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum. If you don’t already have a stake in these names, this could be an ideal time to make an initial investment.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe’re closing in on the sixth month of the year, but nothing’s really changed with my enthusiasm for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe maker of highly advanced graphics processing units is perhaps the most gripping tech stock of the decade, with a market cap that’s now north of $2 trillion.\n\nAnd even though NVDA stock pulled back a little bit in recent weeks, I see that as people taking their profits rather than doubting Nvidia’s potential. If anything NVDA stock will be gathering momentum for another move higher.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 came out after the closing bell on May 22 and once again blew away expectations. Revenue was $26 billion, up 18% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and up 262% from a year ago. Data center revenue was $22.6 billion, up 427% from a year ago.\n\nNvidia also declared a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7, that will make the stock even more enticing to retail investors.\n\nNVDA stock is up 89% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIn many ways, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) works hand-in-hand with Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia makes the powerful GPUs that are so popular these days, Supermicro handles the server architecture and custom bundling that is so essential to allow GPUs to work with each other to perform rapid calculations.\n\nThat’s why SMCI stock has been on such an impressive run, up more than 200% so far this year.\n\nBut SMCI is also on sale — incredibly, the stock is down 20% from its April highs as investors speculated SMCI has gone up too fast, too quickly.\n\nThat’s just shortsighted thinking. Supermicro earnings have tripled from a year ago and its earnings per share are up fourfold. And as Nvidia continues to roll out upgraded GPUs, Supermicro’s server architecture will continue to be in demand.\n\nSCMI stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is looking a lot better today than it was in late 2022. That’s when META stock hit a low as engagement and monthly active viewers were on the decline.\n\nMeta seemed to be more interested in the internet of the future — the metaverse — than the here and now.\n\nGranted, being a forward-thinking company is important in the tech realm. But Meta was dumping billions into building out the metaverse and hemorrhaging stock price.\n\nFortunately, CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that 2023 would be a year where Meta would focus on profits and what makes the company successful.\n\nAnd it worked. META stock is up 91% in the last 12 months, and the company is capitalizing on AI to make advertising more effective.\n\nIt’s also creating some interested generative AI products that improve the user experience for its Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms.\n\nNow Meta Platforms counts roughly half the global population — nearly 4 billion people — as active monthly users. And META stock is once again one of the best tech stocks to buy. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI understand the skepticism that you may feel with this pick. But let’s make a couple of things clear. First, investing in Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) isn’t an endorsement of Donald Trump’s policies or actions, nor is it a bet that he will win the November election.\n\nSecond, it’s important to know that Trump Media is a highly speculative stock that is highly susceptible to the headlines of the day. It’s not a trade for everyone.\n\nBut if you ignore the drama that surrounds Trump Media, you’ll see that this is a trade about possibilities, not politics. X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and now held privately by Elon Musk, is not the powerhouse that it used to be.\n\nThere is a real opportunity for an alternative to step forward — which is what Meta Platforms did with its Threads platform.\n\nRight now, Trump Media isn’t even close to making money. It will take a long time for it to scale and generate a profit.\n\nBut it may be worth a small, speculative investment today. The stock continues to have a lot of momentum behind it, which is why it still gets an “A” in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is pretty much the polar opposite of  Trump Media, which goes to prove that top-rated tech stocks to buy come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nWhile Trump Media is a startup, Dell is a legacy hardware company that makes desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.\n\nBut Dell isn’t acting like a legacy computer company. It’s one of the hottest tech stocks in the market today, with gains of 91% so far in 2024. Investors are jumping all over DELL stock because of the company’s large server business and the potential for companies to upgrade their servers to run AI applications.\n\nDell recorded fourth-quarter revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11% from a year ago. But net income of $1.15 billion was an increase of 91% from last year, and earnings per share of $1.59 was a big improvement from EPS of 84 cents in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nDELL stock is worth taking a position. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother legacy computing company that’s acting more like a young pup than a grizzled hound is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)\n\nLike Dell, IBM is leaning heavily into AI to help power its profits. The company operates its watsonx generative AI platform and has booked more than $1 billion in business related to generative AI. Its software revenue was up 6% in the first quarter of 2024, and overall revenue was up 3%.\n\nIBM is also working on some new AI assistants that are scheduled to be available later this year, and it has partnerships with some of the biggest companies in the world to make watsonx widely accessible.\n\nAnd if you’re an income investor, you have to appreciate IBM’s dividend yield of nearly 4%.\n\nIBM stock is up 5% in 2024 and is recovering nicely from a pullback in April. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf the technology stocks on this list, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is the only that can be classified as a fintech stock.\n\nCoinbase operates a cryptocurrency trading platform that makes nearly 250 different types of assets available for buying, selling or trading.\n\nAnd even if you aren’t interested in investing in cryptocurrency yourself, buying COIN stock allows you to monetize the growth of digital currency and the evolution of blockchain technology.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $1.58 billion, up from $736 million a year ago. The company also turned a profit of $1.17 billion after losing $79 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company managed to top expectations by boasting $511 million in subscription and services revenue, after forecasting a range between $410 million and $480 million.\n\nCOIN stock is up 31% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article both had long positions in NVDA and SCMI. They did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading at a near all-time high. On May 16 the Dow hit 40,000 for the first time in history following a favorable inflation report. Hitting this milestone is a massive deal for the venerable index and the stock market. It shows the market is still booming even in this environment of high interest rates.\n\nThe Dow comprises 30 major companies and has grown by 20% over the last year. Other stock market indices, such as the Nasdaq and S&P 500, have also performed very well over the past year, growing by 32% and 27%, respectively.\n\nHere are a few stocks in the Dow that have led the index to all-time highs. These companies are outliers with the Dow concerning their performance but should be considered solid investment opportunities nonetheless.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a company that provides customer relationship services. It uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) and similar technology to provide sales data for stores, forecasting and improved business workflow.\n\nOver the past year, CRM’s share price has risen by 36% due to strong revenue growth and increased investor interest in developing innovative technologies such as generative AI.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Salesforce released its earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. It said total revenue increased 11% year-over-year with net income of $1.4 billion. It was a nice reversal from last year when it recorded a $98 million loss. Also, free cash flow grew 27% year-over-year allowing it to buy back approximately $1.7 billion in stock.\n\nSalesforce recently initiated a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share, following other large companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nManagement guided full-year revenue for FY 2025 to be in the range of $37.7 billion to $38 billion, which would be an 8% to 9% growth year-over-year.\n\nSalesforce is a solid addition to the Dow with its technology capabilities, particularly its Einstein 1 platform, which is projected to continue being a growth catalyst in the future. It has also shown consistent share price appreciation and is among the best performers this year of companies within the Dow.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a heavy machinery and construction equipment manufacturer that produces tractors, backhoes, asphalt pavers, excavators, articulated trucks, forestry machines and similar equipment.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Apr. 25, CAT reported its earnings for the first quarter of 2024, stating total revenue remained practically unchanged and earnings per share increased by 54% to $5.75. Within the first quarter, Caterpillar announced it repurchased approximately $4.5 billion of stock.\n\nCaterpillar is a strong growth company that has performed very well, especially this year when its share price increased by 68%. It has a solid dividend yield of 1.45% and has increased its dividend annually for the last 30 years.\n\nCaterpillar has been one of the major players in the Dow’s impressive performance this year, with it reaching an all-time high of $382 per share.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) offers consumer finance products and services, such as credit and charge cards, banking services, expense management, fraud protection and payment processing. It sells and markets its products primarily through its online application to consumers and businesses.\n\nOver this past year, AXP’s share price has risen by 56%, primarily due to strong earnings.\n\nOn Apr. 19, American Express reported earnings for the first quarter of 2024, stating that total revenue increased 11% and net income rose 34% to $2.4 billion. AXP stated that it is experiencing strong demand for its products amongst Millennial and Gen-Z customers.\n\nAXP provides investors with a decent dividend yielding 1.15% on an annual basis. Its most recent quarterly distribution was 70 cents per share on Apr. 4, following its board of directors authorizing a 17% increase to its existing quarterly payout.\n\nAXP beat analyst expectations on its most recent earnings results. Still, it reiterated previous guidance for 2024, in which total revenue is projected to increase by 9% to 11%, and earnings per share is expected to grow by 13% to 17%.\n\nAmerican Express is a solid choice for investors seeking stocks within the Dow. Its share price has risen considerably over this past year, and growth in management projects will continue to compound.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "You may not realize it, but last week marked one of the most important data releases of the quarter for investors -- and I'm not talking about the highly anticipated April inflation report.\n\nMay 15 was the deadline for institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows investors to look over the proverbial shoulders of Wall Street's greatest investors to see what they were buying and selling in the latest quarter (in this instance, the quarter ended in March).\n\nSince the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been credited with pushing the broad-market indexes to record highs, it's only logical to examine how Wall Street's smartest billionaire investors approached these companies in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm talking about seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country today, including:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhat these stocks share in common is a massive outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500 over the trailing-10-year period, along with well-defined competitive advantages. For instance, Alphabet's Google has maintained at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back nine years. Meanwhile, Apple has the most robust capital-return program on the planet among publicly traded companies. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it's repurchased $674 billion of its own stock. Buybacks of this magnitude can provide a hearty lift to earnings per share.\n\nHowever, billionaires have very different outlooks for these seven stocks. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, billionaires dumped shares of two Magnificent Seven stocks, while absolutely piling into another.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires sent to the chopping block: Nvidia\n\nThe first member of the Magnificent Seven that prominent billionaire investors seemingly wanted nothing to do with in the first quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia. Just as we witnessed during the fourth quarter, eight well-known billionaires were sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would billionaires sell what's arguably been the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street? Aside from simple profit-taking, there are a few potential red flags that Wall Street's brightest investors may be focusing on.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia is set to face increased competition from all angles. Although it's well publicized that external competitors will be vying for graphics processing unit (GPU) market share in AI-accelerated data centers this year, the bigger threat may come from Nvidia's own top customers.\n\nInterestingly, Magnificent Seven components Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four top customers -- about 40% of net sales. Each of these companies is developing their own AI-GPUs to deploy in collaboration with Nvidia's H100 GPUs in their high-compute data centers. The internal development of AI-GPUs from other Magnificent Seven businesses strongly suggests that we're witnessing a peak in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nHistory has also been incredibly unkind to next-big-thing investment trends. Over the last three decades, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation or trend that didn't undergo a bubble-bursting event fairly early into its existence. Investors commonly overestimate the uptake and enterprise adoption of new technologies, which leads to bubbles. If the artificial intelligence bubble were to follow history and burst, no company would be hit harder than Nvidia, which saw its sales more than double last year because of AI-GPU demand.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires showed to the door: Meta Platforms\n\nThe second surprising Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires were casting aside during the quarter ended in March is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms. Nine successful billionaires -- or 10, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Meta stock, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,259,650 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,313,528 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,164,151 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (779,637 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (735,911 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (727,500 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (175,614 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (29,157 shares)\n\nThe top reason behind this selling was very likely profit-taking. Since hitting its bear market low in 2022, shares of Meta had gained close to 500%.\n\nBillionaires may also have been leery about Meta's somewhat unpredictable capital expenditure forecasts. Shares came under pressure in 2022 because of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's desire to spend on the metaverse and augmented/virtual reality innovations. They began rallying in a big way last year when spending forecasts were reined in a bit. But based on Meta's 2024 guidance, it appears as if Zuckerberg and his team are willing to aggressively spend, once again, on AI and other innovations that may not have a sizable payoff for years to come.\n\nThe third possibility for this selling activity might be concern about the health of the U.S. economy. Meta generates nearly 98% of its sales from advertising, and ad spending is highly cyclical. The stock market is incredibly pricey at the moment, and a historic decline in M2 money supply -- the first since the Great Depression -- suggests a recession might occur in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBut unlike Nvidia, I believe billionaires will regret paring down their stakes in Meta. It owns the top social media assets worldwide (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger), and has been able to sustain strong ad pricing power in most economic climates. Meta remains one of the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, based on forward-year cash flow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire investors can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nWhile trading activity in the Magnificent Seven leaned decisively to the sell side with Nvidia and Meta, and was mixed with other constituents, the one member that billionaires absolutely couldn't stop buying is e-commerce leader Amazon. Nine billionaire investors were willing buyers of Amazon stock during the first quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAlthough Amazon is best-known for its world-leading online marketplace, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income and cash flow from a couple of its faster-growing ancillary segments. It's these ancillary operations that likely attracted billionaires to buy shares of Amazon hand over fist during the March-ended quarter.\n\nArguably no operating segment is more important than cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, and is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. Best of all, cloud-service margins are significantly higher than online retail margins, which means AWS typically accounts for a majority of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAdvertising services and subscription services are holding their own, as well, with sustained double-digit sales growth. Amazon draws more than 2 billion people to its site each month, which affords it exceptional ad-pricing power. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscriptions in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe final selling point for billionaires might be Amazon's valuation. Since Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business, cash flow is a far better valuation metric than the traditional price-to-earnings ratio. After spending the entirety of the 2010s at a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow, Amazon can be purchased right now for just 12.4 times consensus cash flow for 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) Can Still Rise Despite Sitting at the Top",
        "content": "Numero Uno stock Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a $3 trillion market cap, has delivered a return of around 1,154% over the last decade. Sitting at the top of the global stock markets, will it continue to give similar returns in the next decade? I believe the answer is yes. Microsoft’s consistently strong performance, cloud & AI-driven tailwinds, and robust margins despite substantial AI investments make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll take advantage of any market weakness in the coming months to purchase MSFT.\n\nMicrosoft’s Recent Results Were Strong Yet Again\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft reported impressive Fiscal Q3 results for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all business segments. Q3 adjusted earnings of $2.94 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $2.82 per share. Also, earnings jumped 20% year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.45 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, revenues soared 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion. The Intelligent Cloud business segment, encompassing Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and Windows, among others, grew 23% year-over-year to $26.7 billion, beating expectations yet again. The much-watched segment now comprises 35% of total revenues, with AI playing a significant role as a catalyst driving growth.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of AI by businesses, there is a substantial demand for Microsoft’s Azure and related cloud services. Not surprisingly, Azure and other cloud services witnessed solid revenue growth of 31% (28% in constant currency), significantly surpassing Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nDespite the strong Q3 performance, Microsoft provided a conservative outlook, slightly below expectations. Fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to be $64 billion compared to consensus expectations of $64.5 billion, with Azure revenues expected to grow between 30% and 31%.\n\nOn a positive note, Microsoft offered its FY2025 outlook, anticipating double-digit growth in both revenues and operating income. This forecast reassures investors of the company’s sustained growth trajectory.\n\nAI Will Continue to Act as a Long-Term Catalyst for MSFT\n\nAI has propelled Microsoft to become the largest stock in the world, and it will continue to be the driving force behind its growth story in the coming decade. Microsoft’s early investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT has positioned it ahead of other tech giants.\n\nThe demand for AI remains insatiable, with Microsoft management stating that it exceeds available capacity. This high demand drives continuous heavy investment in AI by Microsoft and other tech titans.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s AI investment plans align with those of its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the space. For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported CAPEX (capital expenditures) of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) spent $6.72 billion. Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Microsoft reported a 22% sequential jump in CAPEX (including finance leases) to $14 billion versus $11.5 billion in the prior quarter. The majority of that amount is assigned to scaling its AI infrastructure and securing processors from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for running large AI models.\n\nIncreasing CAPEX may impact margins. However, Microsoft’s management is taking the initiative to keep costs low and protect margins. For instance, newer and more efficient AI products like GPT-4o and Mai-1 are expected to increase scale and keep costs under control. Furthermore, Mai-1 will compete with major rivals, namely Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nAzure AI Services, which includes AI training and other AI-related services, is experiencing remarkable growth. Azure competes directly with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Google’s cloud business and is closely watched by investors. Notably, Azure AI Services is now estimated to be an over $4 billion run rate business. For comparison (although not a direct comparison), Amazon’s AWS has reached a $100 billion annual run rate. This underscores the substantial opportunity for Azure powered by AI in the coming years.\n\nDuring the earnings call, management confirmed that Azure continues to gain market share, with 65% of Fortune 500 companies using Azure Open AI. There’s a clear acceleration in Azure’s growth, marked by the signing of large deals across several diverse industries, with names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) being added to its clientele. Azure will likely continue to see the growth momentum with increased market share gains in the coming months.\n\nFurther, Microsoft 365 Copilot (AI-backed online assistant) is showing steady adoption. Management stated that 60% of Fortune 500 companies now use the Copilot AI program. The company remains optimistic about its growing contribution to revenues in the coming years.\n\nIt’s not just Azure and Copilot. Microsoft’s AI investments and capabilities are expected to boost revenues and profitability across other product portfolios, such as GitHub, Fabric, and Security.\n\nOn a separate note, MSFT’s acquisition of gaming software rival Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will continue to add to MSFT’s diversified revenue stream. Microsoft recently announced the unveiling of its own mobile store game, equivalent to Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Google’s Play Store.\n\nMicrosoft’s Valuation Isn’t Cheap but Isn’t Expensive Either\n\nDespite being the most valuable stock in the world, Microsoft’s valuation isn’t as expensive as one would think. At first glance, It may look expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37x currently. Nonetheless, I believe the premium is justified, given its favorable industry-leading market position, robust margins, diversified revenue stream, and huge exposure to high-growth AI and cloud businesses.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, online retail and cloud computing giant Amazon is trading at a P/E of 51x, while social networking company Meta Platforms is trading at a 27x P/E.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Microsoft stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the earnings report. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past month. Microsoft stock’s average price target of $491.56 implies 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying MSFT for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm, and Microsoft continues to lead the charge. Microsoft’s early investments in AI have positioned it as a frontrunner in the industry, yielding significant rewards. I believe that Microsoft’s GenAI innovations will continue to drive revenues, profits, and cash flows in the coming years.\n\nWith a long runway for growth and profitability ahead, Microsoft remains a compelling investment. I plan to keep adding MSFT to my portfolio, taking advantage of any market weaknesses in the coming months.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

The company announced its first dividend in Q1 2024 to plenty of fanfare. The first quarterly dividend is set at $0.20, but this payout should have a double-digit growth rate for several years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the company has a low 0.45% yield, it’s doing everything else right. Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year (YoY) in the first quarter, as advertising and cloud computing fueled the firm’s growth. Net income increased by 57% YoY, as Alphabet continued to trim its costs.\n\nThe stock trades at a reasonable 27 P/E ratio and is up 29% year-to-date. The long-term snapshot is even better, as the stock has gained 216% over the past five years. Analysts are feeling bullish on the stock and have rated it as a Strong Buy.

People will continue to use their Visa cards thanks to the convenience, security and rewards. The company makes a small percentage of each transaction.

Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend for 67 consecutive years.\n\nProcter & Gamble reported 1% YoY revenue growth and 11% YoY EPS growth in Q3 FY24. Investors shouldn’t expect high growth numbers, but the company offers some insulation with its 27 P/E ratio. Shares are up 15% year-to-date and have gained 58% over the past five years.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.

CEO and co-founder Patrick Collison; former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman; Shopify Inc. CEO Tobi Lütke; and Charlie Songhurst, an investor and former Microsoft Corp. executive. None of the men will be paid, a Meta spokesperson confirmed.\n\n“I’ve come to deeply respect this group of people and their achievements in their respective areas, and I’m grateful that they’re willing to share their perspectives with Meta at such an important time as we take on new opportunities with AI and the metaverse,” Zuckerberg wrote in the internal note to employees, which was reviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nMeta already has an 11-person board of directors, though one of those members, former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, will not stand for reelection at Meta’s annual meeting at the end of the month. The Meta Advisory Group will be different than a board in that its members are not elected by shareholders, and they don’t have a fiduciary duty to the company, a spokesperson said.\n\n“This advisory group is tasked with offering insights and recommendations on technological advancements, innovation and strategic growth opportunities,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Billionaire Ray Dalio is Selling These Tech Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "When billionaire Ray Dalio left his empire Bridgewater Associates in 2022, the inflation storm and economic uncertainties were pummeling the financial markets. While the fund had started 2022 on a positive note, its returns came crashing down it the last quarter of the year. According to a Bloomberg report, The Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater fell about 13% in Q4'2022 through November. Bridgewater’s Pure Alpha II fund also fell a whopping 20% in the two months through the end of November 2022. Over the past four years, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund declined by 4%. In 2023, the Pure Alpha fund fell 7.6%, while the hedge fund industry's average return in 2023 through November was 4.35%, with many top hedge funds in the league of Bridgewater (Ken Griffin's Citadel, for example) posting double-digit returns.\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater 2024 Returns So Far\n\nBut what about Ray Dalio's Bridgewater returns in 2024? Ray Dalio gave reins of the fund to a younger management, who had plans to turn things around by cutting costs and restructuring. So far the strategy seems to be working. In April, Bloomberg reported that Bridgewater's flagship Pure Alpha fund has rebounded a whopping 16% this year.\n\nDalio's All Weather Strategy is Under The Weather\n\nBridgewater's All Weather investing strategy developed by Ray Dalio seems to be facing problems in the current market environment, latest reports show.\n\nBut what is this All Weather strategy? Bridgewater explains:\n\n\"I developed a modus operandi to expect surprises. I learned not to let my experiences dominate my thinking; I could go beyond my experiences to see how the machine works.” Ray realized he could understand the economic machine by breaking down economies and markets into their component pieces, and studying the relationships of these pieces through time. This type of thinking is central to All Weather.\"\n\nBut data shows that risk parity funds have trailed traditional 60/40 portfolios since 2019. A Bloomberg report said that pension funds are pulling billions from risk parity funds. One of the biggest reasons why risk parity funds saw losses is rising interest rates. When the Fed started increasing rates, volatility surged past these risk parity funds' acceptable levels and bonds fell to unforeseen levels.\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some technology stocks billionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater was selling in the first quarter of 2024. While the fund sold many tech stocks in the first quarter, overall, its portfolio allocation to tech jumped to 17% as of the end of March from just 7% in the previous quarter. Some top names in the portfolio are NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this article we take a look at 5 stocks Bridgewater sold off completely or reduced its stake in during the March quarter. To see more tech stocks Bridgewater sold off in in 2024, click 4 Tech Stocks Ray Dalio is Selling in 2024.\n\nBILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates sold all 20,844 shares of the financial software company BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) during the first quarter of 2024. Over the past one year BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) shares have gained about 40%. BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) recently posted fiscal Q3 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.60, beating estimates by $0.07 per share. Revenue in the quarter jumped 18.5% year over year to $323 million, beating estimates by $16.86 million.\n\nWhile Dalio's fund is selling BILL, it's buying major companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nBridgewater Associates cut its stake in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) by 94% in the first quarter of 2024. The fund still owns 118,397 shares of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) as of the end of March.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nLike HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) was also dumped by Bridgewater in the first quarter, as the fund sold 560,336 shares of the company. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) shares have gained about 23% over the past one year.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 50 hedge funds had stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) as of the end of the March quarter.\n\nHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is in the spotlight as analysts expect PC demand to remain upbeat amid an AI-driven refresh cycle. Market data firm Canalys recently said that about 18% of total personal computer shipments globally will be AI-capable PCs, with the firm estimate about 48 million AI-capable PCs to be shipped this year.\n\nHowever, Ray Dalio's hedge fund dumped 77% of its stake in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nDalio's fund is selling HP but it's holding on to its huge stakes in companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nGreenlight Capital mentioned HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“The title of our Sohn presentation was “Solve AI,” which was a play on Solvay’s corporate name. Nonetheless, we established another new long position that actually stands to benefit from AI, which we believe is not reflected in the current stock price. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) sells computers, printers and adjacent products and supplies. We established an initial position at an average price of $30.76 per share, which is about 9x current year earnings estimates. Recent results reflect a two-and-a-half-year cyclical downturn in demand for computers, which followed a mini-boom driven by COVID and related demand for equipment to work-from-home. We believe that we are, at a minimum, on the cusp of a normal PC refresh cycle, which should drive earnings above estimates. HPQ has committed to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. The shares have a 3.6% dividend yield and we estimate HPQ has the capacity to buy back 25-30% of the outstanding shares over the next three years.

Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.”\n\nRay Dalio sold many more tech stocks in Q1'2024.

Hence, these reductions are derived from several productivity and cost-cutting measures.\n\nAdditionally, compared to Q1 of 2023, when there was a net outflow of $32 million, Teladoc’s first-quarter free cash flow showed a net outflow of $27 million. Despite being a normally low cash flow quarter because of yearly incentive compensation payments, this increase in cash flow management shows improved operational efficiency and financial discipline.\n\nFinally, Teladoc has had success cross-selling more services by utilizing the size of its installed base. Cross-selling to the current clientele accounted for two-thirds of bookings in Q1, while the remaining one-third came from new customers. Hence, adding new services improves customer retention while optimizing income from current members.\n\nUnder Armour (UAA) under armour stock\n\nSource: 2p2play / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q4 of fiscal 2024, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) increased its gross margin by 1.7% to 45%. The gross margin grew to 46.1% for 2024, a 1.3% boost. Decreased product and freight costs resulting from supply chain improvements partly contributed to the increase in gross margin. Nevertheless, negative foreign exchange effects and a rise in direct-to-consumer marketing efforts somewhat countered this.\n\nMoreover, adjusted SG&A expenditures in Q4, excluding particular costs such as litigation reserve fees, decreased by 5% to $546 million and by 2% to $2.3 billion for 2024. The decrease in costs suggests that the bottom line may improve shortly. By the end of Q4, inventory had dropped by 19% to $958 million. Hence, this demonstrates the company’s proactive approach to inventory management.\n\nLastly, with $859 million in cash at the end of Q4, Under Armour had no outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility. The corporation expressed confidence in its current situation and prospects by announcing a fresh $500 million share repurchase program.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Facebook removed the account of the suspected shooter of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico after the attack, the company and a state agency said on Tuesday, as the government continues to probe whether the attacker had help.\n\nFico is recovering in hospital and no longer in immediate danger after being hit by four bullets last Wednesday, in the first major assassination attempt on a European political leader for more than 20 years.\n\nSlovak government officials said on Sunday, four days after the shooting, that the attacker may have not been a \"lone wolf\" as first believed, with one factor being that the suspect's Facebook and communication history was deleted after the attack.\n\nInterior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok had said an investigation team had been set up, which would also look into whether the suspect acted as part of a group of people who had been encouraging each other to carry out an assassination.\n\nOn Tuesday, Meta said it had removed the attacker's account on the night of the incident and had informed Slovak authorities about the removal. It remained in touch with authorities and law enforcement, it said.\n\nNews websites Dennik N and Aktuality were the first to report Meta had removed the attacker's Facebook profile.\n\nThe state Council for Media Services, which had been in contact with Facebook and other social media platforms immediately after the attack, also said in a statement that Meta had informed it on Tuesday of the account removal.\n\nSutaj Estok told broadcaster TA3 on Tuesday evening the most likely version was still the attacker had accomplices but investigators were working on both possibilities, including him acting alone.\n\n\"I guarantee we will investigate everything,\" he said.\n\nSutaj Estok had said on Sunday when discussing the possible involvement of more people that \"I think that two hours after... committing this act, the perpetrator had all Facebook and communication history erased, and it was not erased by him or apparently by his wife.\"\n\nOfficials have said the attack on Fico was politically motivated. Local news media say the suspect - identified by prosecutors as Juraj C. - is a 71-year-old former security guard at a shopping mall and the author of three collections of poetry.\n\nThere has been no official statement made public from the suspect, or any lawyer representing him.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Simplify Your Investing: 3 Stocks That Can Anchor the Optimal Portfolio",
        "content": "Trying to strike a balance between growth and stability is tough. On the one hand, you could stack too much cash into speculative stocks with near-term promises that fizzle into nothing when the rubber meets the road, such as Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE). On the other hand, go for too stable a selection, and you end up collecting a measly income from dividends with limited capital appreciation upside, like if you invest most of your excess cash into something such as Realty Income (NYSE:O).\n\nBut there’s a way to balance the two extremes. “Big tech” and healthcare, specifically MedTech, have a bright and seemingly endless series of future possibilities and applications. Likewise, the best-in-class companies within both sectors have the financial stability and operational prowess to keep the lights on while continuing innovation. These three companies meet that mark and may be among the best stocks to buy if you want to create a three-tiered portfolio anchor.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is often top-of-mind when mentioning tech stocks to buy, for good reason. The company’s pervasive operational arms touch most of us daily, and it continues fostering a culture of growth and innovation unlike, say, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Luckily for long-term buyers, per-share pricing is at a discount after shares slid when management’s spending breakdown and a muted sales forecast overshadowed a 117% increase in quarterly net income. Across the board, Meta’s performance indicators were stellar for the first quarter of 2024. Highlights include higher daily active user rates, improved ad impressions, increased ad spending, and over $15 billion spent on capital returns to shareholders. Still, the stock dropped dramatically — but don’t let that dissuade you.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMuch of the short-term turbulence came from higher cost projections, but that’s a good thing. A planned record-high series of capital expenditures, mostly focused on improving Meta’s artificial intelligence capabilities, weighed on investors’ minds. Zuckerberg noted that this would “grow [Meta’s] investment envelope meaningfully before [it makes] much revenue from some of these new products.”\n\nSome may view Zuckerberg’s varied metaverse initiatives as a guide for Meta’s AI prospects. However, it’s important to consider the company’s long history of forward-thinking projections that take time to bear fruit. Given Meta’s track record, this temporary dip presents a compelling case among stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a juggernaut among long-term stocks to buy, seamlessly integrating innovative hard tech, robotics, and the global growth trajectory of healthcare. As a key player in both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is undeniably stable while increasingly relied upon as a provider of high-end, specialized medical equipment. Unlike competitors focusing on conventional medical hardware, Intuitive Surgical revolutionizes surgery to enhance provider efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is expanding aggressively globally as the healthcare industry continues its post-pandemic rebound. The company’s latest quarterly report highlighted a significant 16% year-over-year increase in the global use of its premier robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, and matched the prior period’s installation rate (312 installed in 2023’s first quarter, and 313 installed this year). This progress, coupled with an 11% sales increase and net income rise to $545 million from $355 million, solidifies Intuitive Surgical’s position as one of today’s top stocks to buy.\n\nKeep an eye on Intuitive Surgical this year as the company prepares to unveil its next-generation da Vinci platform. According to CEO Gary Guthart, this new model will feature “10,000 times the processing power” of current versions, significantly enhancing data analysis, sensing technology, and overall digital and analytical functions.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy. TSLA stock. stocks that could be the next Tesla\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) isn’t having the best time this year, but don’t let that detract from its long-term potential among stocks to buy. Firstly, I’d caution anyone bearish on Tesla’s prospects not to bet against Elon Musk. No matter your personal preference, he has an indomitable spirit and force of will that’s carried him thus far. I have little doubt he’s capable of keeping the company on a growth trajectory despite short-term setbacks.\n\nSecond, the company’s current prospects aren’t as bad as many would make you believe. While car sales slumped, that’s indicative of the wider economic landscape than it is an indictment of Tesla’s potential. Likewise, the company is increasingly mature and is diversifying revenue streams, much like legacy automakers. In the most recent filing, Tesla posted a 25% increase in services and a 7% bump in energy generation and storage sales — though most don’t focus on these top-line increases. That’s a mistake, though, as Tesla’s market strength will also inevitability lead to saturation, and today’s early forays into alternative sales streams will be a make-or-break opportunity for its long-term positioning.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "What Nvidia says about AI chip demand could matter for more than just the tech trade",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence enthusiasm has been spreading across the stock market.\n\nWednesday night's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings call will mark a year since the chipmaker first shocked Wall Street with its demand for AI chips. Since then, mentions of AI have skyrocketed on earnings calls, growing 186% since the first quarter of 2023, per Bank of America Research.\n\nThis comes as the conversation around AI has quickly moved from AI chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) to AI power users like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). More recently, strategists have highlighted a broadening out to other sectors that could benefit from the increased power usage, like Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), and Commodities.\n\n\"It's not just about NVDA anymore,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nThis shift has already been underway in the market. Several precious metals, including copper (HG=F), which strategists have said will benefit from AI spend, have hit recent highs. The Utilities and Energy sectors are two of the top-performing sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this year, up about 15% and 13%, respectively.\n\nThis has trickled down to individual names that are now rivaling the meteoric stock rise of Nvidia since the start of 2024. Texas-based Vistra Corp (VST) is up roughly 140% this year, while Constellation Energy (CEG) shares have risen nearly 90%, which is about in line with Nvidia's rise this year.\n\nIn a note on Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson listed Utilities as an Overweight sector, noting it offers \"upside to the AI power theme.\" Wilson highlighted that the Power and Utilities team at Morgan Stanley believes electricity could rise from 3% of total US consumption in 2023 to about 10% by 2030, driven by new AI data centers that are 50 times the size of previous ones.\n\n\"Both traditional and alternative energy providers have upside revisions potential amid the increasing need for AI data center power and more favorable data center power deals,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nAnd companies have been playing up their role in the AI buildout too.\n\nResearch from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter. More than 66% of companies in the Energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.\n\nGiven the big-picture implications, investors will be closely watching Nvidia's report for color on AI chip demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus far, Nvidia has repeatedly surprised investors on this front, continuously topping analyst expectations for quarterly results and boosting its outlook for the coming quarter amid robust demand for its AI servers.\n\nWhether this trend holds or breaks could now have repercussions for a variety of sectors.\n\n\"If markets wake up to say, 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit,' and that's reflected in those valuations,\"' JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley told Yahoo Finance, \"that's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\" Nvidia Corporation logo is displayed on a smartphone screen, with a graphic representation of the stock market in the background.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy on the Dip: May 2024",
        "content": "Don’t count Metaverse stocks to buy out just yet. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is shifting its focus on building out its artificial intelligence and metaverse technologies. Firms like HSBC are introducing a fund designed to seize opportunities in the metaverse for affluent clients in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nThis year, the global metaverse e-commerce market could grow 30% and reach a value of $30 billion this year. By 2025, the market could be worth $42 billion. By 2030, it could be worth more than $210 billion.\n\nThat being said, use weakness when choosing metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) gapped from about $40 to a low of $30 after cutting its annual bookings forecast. However, with the negativity now priced in, it’s starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $33.59, it’s also starting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R and could soon refill that bearish gap at around $40 again in the near term.\n\nRBLX is one of the top metaverse stocks to buy and hold long term.\n\nMoving forward, RBLX could easily push aggressively higher. For one, the company has about 16 million daily active users in the U.S. who spend about $150 annually. There are another 62 million outside of the U.S. who spend an average of about $24 a year.\n\nAlso, the company is opening a new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nIn addition, while we’ve seen multiple firms pile on with price downgrades, the pullback is overdone. The negativity has been priced in. And with the future potential growth of the metaverse, most notably metaverse e-commerce, RBLX is a steal at current prices.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeakness in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a buy opportunity.\n\nBut don’t wait too long to buy.\n\nAfter dropping from about $230 to $141 in earnings, it’s just starting to pivot higher again. Last trading at $166.33, I’d like to see AMD retest $180 again shortly. Helping, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just added AMD artificial intelligence chips to its cloud computing products.\n\nTwo, analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of AMD with a buy rating, with a price target of $190 a share. AMD even just replaced Nvidia on the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our views on NVDA and AMD haven’t changed, but the relative move in stock prices YTD causes us to make a tactical shift in priority, moving AMD to the Wolfe Alpha List, replacing NVDA, which is up ~90% YTD and ~100% since it was added to the list in November 2023,” added Wolfe.\n\nWe also must consider that companies racing forward with data centers for artificial intelligence, and even the metaverse, will need plenty of chips from companies like AMD.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) An image of a VR headset and headphones; the word metaverse on the headset. metaverse cryptos\n\nSource: PopTika/Shutterstock\n\nThe last time I mentioned the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), it traded at around $12.41 on May 8. Still rebounding from its dip to $11.40, the METV ETF still offers a solid long-term opportunity on the metaverse.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U) and Microsoft to name a few of them.\n\nWith some of the top tech heavyweights on board, I’d buy the METV ETF at current prices and check back on it in a few months. From its last traded price of $12.55, I’d like to see it closer to $20, with its holdings in NVDA, AAPL and RBLX expected to explode higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Meta and Coinbase link up with Match to fight pig-butchering, romance scams",
        "content": "Bad people who prey on those looking for love, or hoping to make a quick buck, have been around since biblical times. But in recent years, the rise of three newer technologies—social media, online dating platforms, and crypto—have supplied these predators with powerful new tools to expand their reach. The result has been a recent flood of heartbreaking stories about online romance scams and \"pig butchering,\" a term used by Chinese crooks to describe slowly gaining the trust of someone before fleecing them in an investment swindle.\n\nThe good news is that some of the biggest companies whose platforms are exploited for these scams are fighting back. On Tuesday, an usual coalition of tech and crypto companies joined with Match—the dating giant that runs apps like Tinder—to announce Tech Against Scams, an initiative to share information and resources in order to combat romance scams and pig butchering. The coalition includes Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as the crypto firms Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, and Gemini.\n\n“We hope that this coalition will serve as a force multiplier for security teams at tech companies to share threat insights and trends to enable more impactful disruptions of scam networks around the world,\" Meta Chief Information Security Officer Guy Rosen said in a statement.\n\nThe new coalition comes at a time when pig-butchering has become a growing problem in the U.S. Last week, the Justice Department arrested two Chinese nationals in California who allegedly managed an international pig-butchering syndicate that had taken in at least $73 million. An earlier FBI report, meanwhile, stated that Americans lost $700 million to romance scams in 2022 and $2.5 billion overall to crypto-related scams.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Match VP of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth explained that the current wave of scams is primarily being run by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia. These gangs often rely on victims of human trafficking to reach out to potential marks in other countries, and entice them into text message exchanges. These conversations involve the scammer posing as a love interest or a friendly source of investment advice with the goal of persuading the recipient to send cryptocurrency to the criminal gang. After extracting as much money as they can, the sender vanishes.\n\nAccording to Roth, who occupied a similar trust-and-safety role at Twitter, the scammer gangs have become adept at migrating to other online platforms—be it a social media site or a dating app—if they are detected and kicked off a site. He says that by forming a coalition, the companies will no longer be operating in silos. Instead, they will be able to swap information that expedites the discovery of scammers, and to share the tools they have each built to fight them. Roth's hope is that by combining resources, the group will be able to quickly boot the criminals no matter \"where in the kill chain\" they are discovered.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilip Martin, chief security officer at Coinbase, says Tech Against Scams was inspired in part by similar initiatives launched in an earlier era when Facebook and Google worked together to detect bad actors on their sites. He added that even though the new coalition includes Coinbase's rivals in the crypto industry, \"there are no competitive concerns\" when it comes to sharing information that could identify and thwart scammers.\n\nTech Against Scams is the first coalition of its kind to span a diverse group of tech and crypto companies, and it intends to get bigger. Martin and Roth said the group is already talking to several other firms, including some very familiar to consumers, that are used by crooks for romance and pig-butchering scams.\n\nCurrently, there are notable names missing from the coalition—the giant crypto exchange Binance and the stablecoin issuer Tether, whose tokens are a big part of the illicit pig-butchering economy. Martin would not say if he or other members of Tech Against Scams have been in talks with the two companies, but did say the coalition is open to any that shares its goals.\n\nBoth Martin and Roth sought to present a realistic view of their attempts to combat romance scams and pig butchering, as each noted that the improvements they make will be incremental and not solve the problem entirely. \"The reality is these scams have been around since the beginning of time,\" said Martin.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Focusing on short-term opportunities when investing is crucial. If you miss such opportunities, your regret could last a lifetime. These are three technology stocks you can’t ignore, chosen for their recent innovations and market approaches.\n\nThe first one stands out because of its substantial expansion in the data center market. The firm’s sales of server CPUs have increased by a noteworthy double-digit percentage. One of its GPUs has produced over a billion in sales in fewer than two quarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the second one is making the most of its strategic realignment with Foundry Services and substantial government assistance. The firm showcased its growing client base by drawing hundreds of partners. The company’s ability to innovate and grow is strengthened by its acceptance of the largest prize from the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinally, the third one’s market penetration and inventiveness are demonstrated by the quick acceptance of its AI Platform (AIP) across various sectors. The company’s bootcamp approach has proven successful in shortening sales cycles and generating many new customers.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSales of server CPUs from AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) boosted by double digits. This was a major motion in the Data Center segment’s 80% year-over-year (YoY) top-line growth. In less than two quarters, MI300 generated over $1 billion in sales, the fastest ramp in AMD’s history.\n\nMoreover, its commercial acceptability and potential are reflected in its quick adoption and deployment in significant hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). With over 100 giant companies and AI clients, the MI300x is establishing new standards in AI performance. It leads the way in inferencing performance compared to the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100.\n\nFurther, AMD’s non-GAAP gross margin increased to 52%, up 2.3% YoY. This enhancement shows AMD’s rising operational effectiveness and profitability. In addition to making up a sizable amount of the overall revenue, these divisions had larger margins than the gaming and embedded segments.\n\nFinally, operating income increased significantly from prior quarters to $1.1 billion, or an operating margin of 21%. Higher revenues and effective cost control caused this margin increase. To this point, AMD has sustained high profitability even with a 10% YoY increase in operational expenditures, mostly for marketing and research.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) strategic realignment through Intel Foundry is one of its key competitive advantages. At its first-ever Intel Foundry Direct Connect, the firm brought together about 300 partners, clients, and prospective clients. Microsoft is the company’s fifth customer for the Intel 18A process node. The lifetime transaction value has been upgraded to surpass $15 billion. Hence, this significant achievement highlights Intel’s competitive standing in the semiconductor industry.\n\nMoreover, with the largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act—more than $45 billion in projected grants, tax breaks, and loans—Intel established a strong position as the nation’s leading semiconductor company. Thus, with this significant financial backing, Intel is better able to innovate and grow.\n\nAdditionally, Intel has made strides in data centers and AI. One significant advancement is the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which offers 40% more inference power efficiency and 50% quicker inference than rivals like Nvidia’s H100.\n\nLastly, Intel’s data center and AI (DCAI) business achieved 5% YoY growth, driven by higher Xeon ASPs and improved enterprise demand. Therefore, the release of next-generation products, such as Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, further solidifies Intel’s lead in the server market.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) solutions, especially the AIP, are being adopted and expanded quickly, highlighting the company’s capabilities and market penetration. The AIP has applications across several industries, including healthcare, retail and energy, and has significantly increased revenue and client acquisition.\n\nMoreover, the company’s approach of holding bootcamps to highlight the benefits of its products has worked well. These bootcamps attracted over 915 firms, resulting in significant transaction cycle shortening. For instance, five days after finishing a bootcamp, a major utility firm inked a seven-figure agreement, demonstrating Palantir’s solutions’ instant effect and value realization.\n\nAdditionally, using production-level AI, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reduced the number of late jobs by 75% in only four months, serving over 1K customer support personnel. Similarly, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) used Palantir’s solutions more widely, leading to average yearly savings of almost $14 million.\n\nFinally, the U.S. Army selected Palantir as the exclusive prime contractor for the TITAN program’s next-generation targeting node, giving the company a contract worth approximately $178 million. Hence, this is the first major contract for a hardware system that a software business has won, a transformational milestone for the firm.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, INTC and PLTR.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks aren't all hype. This group of tech leaders has made it a habit to deliver market-beating returns. That's why they have earned the moniker, and why investors have flocked toward these companies, sending their market caps to stratospheric levels.\n\nBut even at these heights, there remain excellent reasons to invest in some members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here are two that I think are worth sticking with over the long haul: Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms has proven that its business is incredibly resilient. Though the company struggled a couple of years ago due to mounting economic troubles, increasing interest rates, and lower advertising spending, Meta Platforms stayed the course and was able to bounce back. Revenue growth increased over the past few quarters, the bottom line got back in the green, and free cash flow is trending up, too. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nOne of the secrets behind Meta Platforms' recent comeback -- besides aggressive cost-cutting efforts -- is the company's vast ecosystem. There are few, if any, other corporations in the world with a daily active user count of 3.24 billion. That's the number Meta Platforms ended the first quarter with, and it represented a 7% year over year increase. The tech giant is receiving more money from this audience thanks to its various offerings.\n\nShort-form videos -- also known as Reels -- have played a key part. Meta Platforms uses an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered recommendation system to entice viewers to keep watching. On the other side of the coin, Meta is also utilizing AI to help companies design advertising campaigns with higher returns on investments, an obvious selling point. Considering Meta's large network of users, it's difficult to see the tech company losing significant advertising business -- in fact, quite the opposite.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms will have many growth opportunities, including AI. The company is positioning itself as a leader in the generative AI field, having released a large language model (LLM) called Llama and an AI virtual assistant called Meta AI, among other initiatives. Further, Meta Platforms is still building up the metaverse, which could be another potential massive revenue source in the future.\n\nMeta Platforms has proven to be an incredibly inventive company. Its large ecosystem of users grants it the ability to experiment with various money-making strategies until it finds several lucrative ones. Meta Platforms is currently looking to ramp up monetization on WhatsApp through paid and business messaging, for instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo long as the company remains the leading social media platform -- and its network effect will ensure that it does for a while -- Meta Platforms will be an excellent stock to buy and hold. Lastly, the tech giant now offers a dividend. Though that's just a recent development, Meta Platforms' underlying business is surely strong enough to sustain growing payouts for a long time.\n\nAnd those who opt to reinvest the dividend could see their gains increase meaningfully over time. Just one more reason to hold onto Meta Platforms' stock for good.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon started as an online bookstore before becoming the e-commerce juggernaut we know today. The company's secret has been management's ability to identify and pursue attractive opportunities, and having the innovative abilities to lead major industries in which it does business.\n\nAs it currently stands, Amazon arguably has three attractive long-term growth opportunities. The first is, interestingly enough, e-commerce.\n\nThough retail activity has shifted to online channels over the years, there remains plenty of room to grow. In the U.S., e-commerce accounted for just 15.9% of total retail sales in the first quarter of 2024, an increase from 14.9% in the comparable period of 2023. Being the leading e-commerce platform in the U.S. -- with a 37.6% market share of last year -- Amazon will benefit from the upward trend.\n\nThe website's popularity also allows Amazon to generate meaningful revenue from its advertising business.\n\nSecond, there is cloud computing, another area in which Amazon is the leader. It held a 31% slice of the pie as of the first quarter. Cloud computing can offer a range of benefits to businesses, from ease of data access to increased efficiency and cost savings. The industry should still expand by leaps and bounds, benefiting established leaders like Amazon.\n\nThird, there is AI: Amazon isn't letting this potential gold go to waste. The tech company has started offering various AI services through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. It is also building an LLM to compete with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nAmazon will also benefit from other opportunities, including video and music streaming, its investments in healthcare, and more. The company can still beat the market even with a market cap close to $2 trillion.\n\nInvestors can't go wrong with this one: Holding onto Amazon's stock for good is a great move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Meta Platforms, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.29 = US$56b ÷ (US$223b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nSo, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.4%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Meta Platforms .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Meta Platforms' ROCE Trend?\n\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Meta Platforms. The company has consistently earned 29% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 96% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 159% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\n\nLike most companies, Meta Platforms does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy for a Sizzling Summer",
        "content": "If you’re looking for a profitable summer, then growth stocks should be No. 1 on your priority list. Identifying the best growth stocks to buy – with the help of tools like the Portfolio Grader – is a great first step in your investing journey.\n\nGrowth stocks represent companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to others in the market. Investors can expect these companies to reinvest their earnings back into the business – so there are rarely dividends to speak of – because the No. 1 priority of these companies is to expand, innovate, or scale up operations.\n\nThey are the opposite of value stocks, which are often mature companies with stable earnings and dividends. And while the best value stocks are priced below their fundamentals, top growth stocks often have high price-to-earnings, price-to sales, or price-to-book ratios. But that’s the trade-off when you’re looking for the best growth stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the stock market often experiences its weakest point in the summer, there’s no reason to avoid investing. In fact, I believe these growth stocks to buy will help you beat the market and make for a profitable summer investing season.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the best growth stocks to buy for months now, and that’s not going to end anytime soon. The semiconductor company is on a massive run as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for their ability to operate generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThe most recent win for Nvidia is its new deal with Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), in which the aerospace and defense company will use Nvidia’s AI platform and generative AI software.\n\nNvidia owns roughly 80% of the AI chip market, putting it in a dominant position for years to come. NVDA stock is up 90% this year and is in a position to hit $1,000 per share after it reports earnings on May 22. It gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) isn’t anywhere as big as Nvidia. But it’s still a dynamic growth company that’s using the power of artificial intelligence to see massive gains.\n\nPalantir long made its mark as a defense contractor, using AI and machine learning to provide real-time analysis and predictions to military units in the field.\n\nBut it’s also quickly growing its commercial business through its Artificial Intelligence Platform and its Gotham platform. An important partnership with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will make those products available through Oracle’s cloud network.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Palantir stock pulled back following its first-quarter earnings report, I see good things ahead for this company.\n\nEarnings were for $634.3 million in revenue, up 21% from a year ago. Palantir projects revenue in the range of $649 million to $653 million for the second quarter and raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $2.677 billion and $2.689 billion.\n\nPLTR stock is up 26% this year and up 128% in the last 12 months. It gets a “B” rating for growth and an overall rating of “A” in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is riding AI headwinds to become the biggest company in the world – with a market capitalization of $3 billion, Microsoft is king of the hill for publicly traded companies.\n\nThe software company makes and distributes some of the most well-known products in the world, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Microsoft Teams.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 suite is a must-have product for businesses and personal computer users around the world.\n\nMicrosoft also has an important relationship with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. By investing $13 billion into the company over the years, Microsoft has been in the position of being the first to incorporate the ChatGPT generative AI into its Bing search engine, its Edge browser, and into Microsoft 365 products.\n\nMicrosoft has nicely recovered from its recent dip and the stock is up 11% so far this year. It gets “B” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) a Google Pixel smartphone\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another powerhouse in its own right. With its dominant Google search engine, Chrome browser, and products such as YouTube, Alphabet is in dominant force for both advertisers and content producers.\n\nThe company earned $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024 – an extraordinary figure – with $46.1 billion of that coming from Google search advertising.\n\nRevenue was 15% better than last year, with solid year-over-year growth for YouTube advertising and Google search.\n\nThere are some bearish takes that OpenAI, which is the company that brought ChatGPT to life, could roll out a new AI-powered search engine as part of its partnership with Microsoft and that company’s Bing search engine.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has denied there’s an imminent announcement, but rumors persist and it’s having an effect on GOOG shares.\n\nMy advice? Take advantage of the dip should shares of GOOG stock continue to fall. It could be a great opportunity.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re bullish about the growth of computing and AI – and why wouldn’t you be? – then another growth stock to consider closely is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI).\n\nAfter a huge run in 2023 and early 2024, Supermicro stock has pulled back somewhat, but that looks more like a buying opportunity than anything.\n\nIts earnings report was impressive – sales tripled from a year ago and earnings per share were up fourfold. Supermicro also increased its guidance from $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion previously, to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion currently.\n\nBut bearish investors ruled the day and SCMI stock dropped 23% following the earnings report.\n\nBut the thesis about Super Micro Computer hasn’t changed. The company will continue to work closely with chip manufacturers like Nvidia to design server architecture to bundle powerful AI chips so they can perform complex tasks.\n\nSMCI stock is up 218% this year, and continues to get “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. Metaverse\n\nSource: MR Neon / Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the social media company that’s behind Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads and WhatsApp.\n\nIt also made waves in recent years by investing billions into the metaverse, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg hopes the future of computing and our online worlds lie.\n\nWhile I don’t share Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for the metaverse, I can’t help but be impressed with Meta for the staying power of its core products. Meta’s platforms count nearly half of the global population – almost 4 billion people – as monthly average users. That’s extraordinary.\n\nAnd the company’s reach and the detailed information it has on its users – thanks to their users’ profiles and postings – allows Meta to be highly specific in targeting advertising to people who are most likely to buy. If you’re an advertiser, you’re probably very familiar with Meta’s advertising platform.\n\nMETA stock is up 33% in 2024. It gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a very interesting and innovative company. It has a variety of voice recognition products – powered by artificial intelligence – that allow customers to do everything from asking questions about their vehicle maintenance to providing step-by-step training for employees.\n\nEven Nvidia is taking notice. The chipmaker took a stake of its own in the company, and as investors took notice, SOUN stock soared. At one point, shares of SoundHound were up more than 300% this year.\n\nSoundHound reported a strong quarter, with auto units and cloud users expanding by double digits. Revenue was $11.6 million, up 73% from a year ago. The company continued to post losses as it scales, with a net loss of $19.9 million or 7 cents per share.\n\nSOUN stock is up 141% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, and MSFT.

        "content": "Investing in blue-chip stocks is always a good idea. They might not show an immediate upside but do have the potential to navigate through the market turmoil and come out strong. However, not all stocks are made the same and you need a careful eye to figure out the best blue-chip stocks to buy. The economy is finally improving and the S&P 500 breached 5,300 for the first time after a cooler-than-expected inflation report.\n\nA rate cut could be on the way and if you want to rebalance your portfolio with blue-chip stocks that have strong buy ratings, now is the right time to do so. These stocks have proved their strength in the industry and recently reported impressive quarterly numbers. Several analysts have strong buy ratings making them hot picks right now. Let’s dive deep into them.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top blue-chip stock, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a strong buy rating from a total of 41 analysts. Currently trading for $183 and up 22% year-to-date, the stock has a price target of $220, a 19% upside potential. The e-commerce giant reported strong fundamentals driven by its cloud segment Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the thriving advertising segment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts were impressed with the first-quarter results and are expecting higher advertising and cloud computing revenue in the coming quarters. The company has been using artificial intelligence for a long time now and the management expects the demand for AI to boost the cloud computing revenue throughout the year.\n\nIt has also invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic which is the maker of Calude 3, a ChatGPT competitor. Besides the cloud segment, Amazon’s e-commerce business continues to dominate the industry. Its future is bright and the company has a solid track record of performance. No wonder analysts love the stock!\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leader in the AI industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already wearing the crown but there is a lot more to come. With the growing adoption of AI in industries, the demand for AI chips will be on the rise and this is where Nvidia will continue to benefit. The company is holding the largest market share and no competitor has been able to come close to it.\n\n40 analysts have a strong buy rating for the stock with a price target of $1,026, an 8% upside from the current level. Industry experts believe that the stock will rally after the company announces results on May 22 and recommend buying before the earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock is trading at $943 today and is up 95% YTD. The stock hasn’t been able to hit $1,000 but I believe the upcoming results will give it a boost. Nvidia is the biggest provider of chips for large-language models used for AI chatbots. The AI market is only going to expand and Nvidia will be the first one to benefit.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 36% YTD, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is exchanging hands for $473 and the stock has a strong buy rating from 36 analysts. The stock has an average price target of $522, up 10% from the current level.\n\nMeta reported strong fundamentals with an EPS of $4.71 and a net income of $12.37 billion, more than double from the same period prior year. The revenue came in at $36.46 billion. Analysts believe that the fundamentals and the outlook both are positive and Meta has the ability to deliver.\n\nThe company’s financial results have improved significantly over the past few quarters. It has implemented generative AI features that meet the needs of advertisers and ensure higher views and conversions.\n\nMeta’s revenue is driven by the growing advertising revenue and this segment is set to expand throughout 2024. The company also has enough liquidity to keep investing in AI which will reap rewards in the years to come.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech giant Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the long term. A highly resilient company, Visa hasn’t disappointed even in times of high inflation and high interest rates.\n\nTrading at $279, the stock is up 8% YTD and has shown volatility over the past month due to the mixed inflation reports. 20 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $315, a 12% upside from the current level.\n\nThere are several reasons to bet on Visa stock. It caters to over 100 million merchants and takes a fee from every transaction made using a Visa card. This ensures steady revenue and keeps the operating costs down. As we transition towards a digital economy, Visa is set to benefit.\n\nIts quarterly results were impressive with a revenue of $8.8 billion, up 10% YTD, and the total processed transactions stood at 55.5 billion, up 11%. Visa is in an excellent position today and it has the ability to expand its market share as card usage increases.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one stock that will never disappoint you. Having reported impressive numbers, the company proved its domination in the cloud segment. Its Azure revenue increased 31% YOY. The company is investing heavily in AI and has already started seeing results.\n\nMicrosoft is constantly evolving and did not waste any time before investing in OpenAI and integrating AI in its products and services. It has introduced Copilot which has already become a huge success and recently launched the Copilot for Security.\n\nExchanging hands for $420 today, the stock is up 13% YTD and has increased 34% in the past 12 months. It is also a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 0.71%. 31 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $491, showing a potential upside of 16%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nTrading at $175, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) stock looks undervalued to me. The stock is up 25% YTD and 44% in the past 12 months. It is trading much lower than its competitors Microsoft and Amazon but has a lot of potential to move higher.\n\nAlphabet’s quarterly results were very impressive with a 15% jump in revenue to reach $80.5 billion and the net income stood at $1.89 per share. One thing to keep in mind is that Google will never be dethroned.\n\nIt is hard to imagine our lives without Google and even if competitors make similar products, they will not be able to replace the company. It holds the top position in internet search and has shown steady revenue growth in the cloud segment.\n\nOn Tipranks, 32 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $195, a 12% upside from here. The company declared its first-ever dividend this quarter and I think it is the beginning of something that will last long.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\n12 analysts on Tipranks have a buy rating for Chevron (NYSE:CVX) with an average price target of $188, offering a 16% upside. As of writing, CVX stock is trading for $161 and is up 7% YTD.\n\nThe oil and gas giant is a cash-generating machine and it has reported impressive financials due to the soaring oil prices. Mizuho has a price target of $205 for the stock which is a 27% upside from the current level.\n\nThe demand for combustion-powered vehicles will continue to grow even if we take small steps towards electrification. This will work in favor of Chevron as the production unit will expand.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it reported earnings of $5.5 billion and a 12% rise in production YOY. Crude oil was trading at $80 per barrel and this means Chevron is set to benefit. Even if the price drops, Chevron has enough liquidity to keep going.\n\nIt is a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 4.05%. Analysts are expecting a strong improvement in fundamentals this year as compared to the previous year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "Over the past year, many tech stocks rallied on the prospects of interest rate cuts. But with the Nasdaq now hovering near its all-time highs, it might seem like the right time to take profits in some of those stocks before the bears come back.\n\nThat's a prudent strategy, but I believe investors should still be adding more high-quality blue-chip tech stocks to their portfolios instead of hastily liquidating them. For me, these three stocks are still no-brainer buys in May: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia, the world's leading producer of discrete GPUs, has been one of the market's hottest growth stocks. Its shares have soared more than 560% over the past three years as the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market has driven more companies to buy its high-end data center chips to process AI tasks.\n\nThat growth spurt initially surprised the bears. Back in fiscal 2023 (which ended in Jan. 2023), its revenue growth flatlined as its adjusted EPS dropped 25%. That deceleration was caused by the PC market's post-pandemic decline and macro headwinds for the data center market. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue and adjusted EPS soared 126% and 288%, respectively, as the popularity of ChatGPT lit a raging fire under the generative AI market.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow another 84% and 93%, respectively, as the demand for new AI chips continues to outstrip available supply. Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at 39 times forward earnings.\n\nNvidia's long-term growth could eventually be throttled by competition from AMD's cheaper data center GPUs, first-party chips at hyperscale cloud providers, and the tightening export curbs on its chip sales to China. But for now, it arguably remains the easiest way to profit from the secular expansion of the global AI market.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms -- the world's top social media company, which owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- saw its shares rally more than 50% over the past three years even as it weathered some tough challenges.\n\nIn 2022, Meta's revenue and EPS declined 1% and 38%, respectively. That slowdown was caused by Apple's privacy changes on iOS, intense competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and macro headwinds for the digital advertising market. At the same time, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment. That mix of slowing growth and higher spending spooked the bulls.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in 2023 Meta's revenue and EPS rose 16% and 73%, respectively. It countered Apple's iOS changes with new tools for gathering first-party data, widened its moat against TikTok by expanding Reels, and offset its declining ad prices with more ad impressions. It also attracted an influx of spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to reach more overseas customers. It also approved a $50 billion buyback and initiated its first dividend earlier this year.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Meta's revenue and EPS to grow 18% and 36%, respectively. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 24 times forward earnings.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the world's fastest-growing cybersecurity companies. Unlike many of its peers, which install their services through on-site appliances, CrowdStrike only provides its end-to-end security tools as cloud-native services -- which are stickier, more cost-efficient, and easier to scale as an organization expands.\n\nCrowdStrike's revenue surged 54% in fiscal 2023 (which ended in Jan. 2023) and grew 36% in fiscal 2024. Its growth decelerated as the macro headwinds made it harder for the company to lock large customers into longer contracts.\n\nAs a result, its net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) declined in the first half of fiscal 2024. But in the second half of fiscal 2024, its net new ARR increased year over year again. That stabilization was supported by its market share gains, new government contracts, and generative AI upgrades for its extended detection and response (XDR) platform. It's also cross-selling more modules to its existing customers.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 30% and 27%, respectively. Its stock might seem pricey relative to its peers at 88 times forward earnings, but I believe its rapid growth and early mover's advantage in the cloud-native cybersecurity space justify its premium valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Firstly, it features a roster of top global brands, encompassing influential companies that dominate various sectors like technology and consumer discretionary, making their products and services integral to our daily lives. Its members are at the forefront of innovation, leading advancements in critical domains such as artificial intelligence and other tech. Thirdly, historically strong performance metrics showcase the Nasdaq 100’s ability to outpace broader market indices. Lastly, these companies commit to sustainable practices. This concept aligns with evolving investor preferences toward responsible investing.\n\nThese options are among the top three stocks to buy in the Nasdaq 100 as they are highly undervalued but present incredible growth and profit opportunities. You need to invest because these NASDAQ 100 stocks are very undervalued. They provide immense growth and profit opportunity. Invest now!\n\nIntel Co. (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel Co. (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leader in designing, developing and producing computing-related products and services. The company’s portfolio comprises mobile, desktop, and graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEarnings and, consequently, profits have been sliding consistently since 2021. However, this trend is reversing, and growth shows signs of stabilization. The YoY increase in revenue of 8.60% demonstrates this. Furthermore, the stock is down 35.36% YTD, indicating a strong potential for future growth. 30 analysts predict an average growth potential of 30.45%, further bolstering the positive outlook.\n\nThe semiconductors sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.6%. The sector will reach $1.41 trillion by 2032. This promising growth trajectory provides a suitable ramp for Intel to expand on. Intel’s client computing group significantly contributes to company revenue, bringing in 59% last quarter. This segment’s revenue shot up by 31% due to increased demand for AI-enabled devices. Additionally, it is making leaps in building Scalable Silicon-Based Quantum Processors, which will give it a sizable advantage in the future.\n\nWith INTC down 35% YTD and significant growth potential, it remains a tremendously undervalued pick.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is an American multinational technology conglomerate that operates as a social technology company. It provides explicit solutions for social networking, advertising, and business insight. Facebook, the former name, is mainly known as Meta.\n\nStory continues\n\nSocial Media Management Software market size was valued at $3.25 billion in 2022. The software is expected to expand at a CAGR of 13.9% during the forecast period. It will then reach $7.10 billion by 2028.\n\nMeta demonstrated a historic surge in Q4 2023. The company reported a staggering $36.45 billion in revenue, reflecting a YoY increase of 27.26%. Net income and diluted EPS, at $12.37 billion and $4.71, respectively, soared over 100% YoY. This exceptional performance not only surpassed expectations on EPS and revenue by 8.10% and 0.64%, respectively but also painted a promising picture of Meta’s potential for growth, instilling confidence in its prospects.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s strategic investments in AI and metaverse technologies and the ban on ByteDancer’s TikTok in the U.S. are expected to drive more users to Meta’s Instagram and Reels. This forward-thinking approach not only positions Meta to potentially reap significant long-term benefits but also sparks excitement about the company’s future. As a result, Meta stands out as one of the most undervalued NASDAQ stocks, promising a bright future.\n\nBooking Holdings Inc.

Valued at a visually large $3,577.38, BKNG has experienced strong YoY growth of 35.19% this past year and is projected to push its valuation even further in fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe online travel booking service industry, which BKNG is located under, is positioned at strong revenue valuations with projections for the market to increase in the next decade. Currently valued at $560 billion in 2022, the industry is slated to reach revenue levels of $1.13 trillion by 2030, forecasting an 8-year CAGR appraised at 9.0%.\n\nBKNG’s new line of technology-based tools has reportedly boosted their performance, as visualized in recent Q1 performance. Among these new platform capabilities is their latest “connected trip” feature, which has expanded the application of Booking’s utility to more aspects of customers’ travels, including entertainment, flights, and hotel accommodations through the same platform. This ease of use of customer interface development and other recent features has allowed Booking to differentiate from the consumer market, expanding its operations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Sold Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Hand Over Fist Last Quarter. You Won't Believe What He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "Investors could do worse than investing in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. The collective gained 111%, on average, in 2023, thrashing the 24% gains of the S&P 500. The group has continued its winning ways, rising 22% on average so far this year, nearly double the 11% increase of the S&P 500 (as of this writing).\n\nThe common thread that unites these tech bellwethers is that they each have artificial intelligence (AI) in their DNA. In recent months, however, some investors have begun to fear that the rally that propelled the Magnificent Seven higher is no longer sustainable and have been looking to other quarters for growth.\n\nAmong those investors is billionaire David Tepper, who heads Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993. Tepper is worth roughly $20.6 billion and has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" for his knack for consistently outperforming his industry peers.\n\nIt's notable, then, that Tepper decreased his exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks to close out the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOut with the old...\n\nA regulatory filing released just this week revealed that Tepper had made big changes among his largest holdings, decreasing his stake in each of the five Magnificent Seven stocks in Appaloosa's portfolio.\n\nTepper cut his stake in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by 44%. He obviously still believes there's additional potential, since Appaloosa still owns 442,000 shares worth an estimated $417 million (as of this writing). It's still the fund's fifth largest holding at roughly 6% of the portfolio.\n\nThe move was probably strategic on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia stock is up a massive 546% since early last year, thanks to accelerating demand for its AI-centric processors. Given its remarkable run, there's likely not as much upside -- at least over the short term.\n\nTepper also slashed his stake in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock by 39%, though it remains a cornerstone holding. Appaloosa still owns 1.1 million shares worth about $531 million, as the fund's fourth-largest holding.\n\nMeta Platforms is the second-best performer among the Magnificent Seven, sporting gains of 293% since early last year. The digital advertising market is in the midst of a remarkable recovery, which will continue to boost Meta's fortunes, but Tepper clearly believes he can get better gains elsewhere.\n\nTepper also reduced his stakes in Microsoft by 18%, Alphabet by 10%, and Amazon by 3%, likely to raise funds for his latest purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo me, the most surprising part of Tepper's move wasn't so much what he sold but what he bought instead, building his positions in a number of well-known Chinese stocks.\n\n...In with the new\n\nAppaloosa's biggest additions in Q1 are among China's most well-known companies.\n\nTepper boosted his stake in Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) by 158%. Appaloosa now owns 11.25 million shares worth an estimated $814 million. That makes the company Appaloosa's No. 1 holding at more than 12% of the portfolio.\n\nAlibaba is best known as one of the largest e-commerce providers in China, which includes its Taobao and T-mall sites. Alibaba Cloud is the world's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure provider, with 4% of the market, behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, with 31%, 25%, and 11%, respectively. The company has also been investing heavily in AI to boost its competitive advantages and has noted that much of its recent cloud growth has been driven by AI.\n\nTepper also increased his stake in PDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD), also known as Pinduoduo, by 171%. Appaloosa now owns 2.1 million shares worth an estimated $244 million. As a result, it has risen to its ninth-largest holding at nearly 4% of the portfolio.\n\nPinduoduo's online marketplace has become the world's second-largest e-commerce company and the largest in China. The company is leveraging its position by expanding internationally with its Temu platform and has been growing faster than its larger rival, Alibaba.\n\nFinally, Tepper increased his stake in China's search leader Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) by 188%. The hedge fund now owns 1.8 million shares worth an estimated $190 million. As a result, it has risen to its 10th-largest holding at roughly 3% of the portfolio.\n\nAside from its search supremacy, Baidu is one of the largest digital advertisers in China and provides a host of internet and AI-related services.\n\nShould investors follow suit?\n\nIt isn't too surprising that Tepper would see value in stocks from China. Earlier this year, China's CSI 300 Index fell to a five-year low as the country's economy continued to struggle. Contracting manufacturing activity, which had fallen for four successive months, helped fuel the decline.\n\nThis has driven the valuations of some of China's most popular stocks to multi-year lows. Even after an uptick in Q1, PDD, Alibaba, and Baidu are selling for 25 times, 20 times, and 14 times trailing 12-month earnings, a discount to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500.\n\nTepper's moves may have been wise. Over the past few months, there have been improvements in China's economic prospects. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.3% year over year in Q1, while the manufacturing and services sectors grew by 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nThat said, investors should be aware of the additional risk factors that are part of investing in China. The economy is still a wild card, government crackdowns can negatively affect investments, and relations between China and the U.S. are frequently rocky.\n\nWhile Tepper's picks may seem intriguing, investors should merely use this information as a starting point and do their own research to determine if these stocks are a good fit with their investing philosophy and risk tolerance.\n\nIt's worth noting that Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Alphabet collectively still make up 38% of Tepper's portfolio, so he obviously believes each of these stocks has room to run. However, it's clear from his purchases this quarter that Tepper believes China stocks could have more upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Incomparable Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "Wall Street has been a stomping ground for volatility since this decade began. Although it's been a banner start to 2024, it was preceded by four consecutive years where the major stock indexes traded off bear and bull markets. No widely followed index has been more volatile than the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nIn 2022, the index was mired in a bear market and shed 33% of its value by the time the year came to a close. But since the opening bell rang in 2023, this innovation-powered index has rallied a cool 60% and hit a fresh record high. There's absolutely no doubt that the Nasdaq is in a bull market -- albeit a fairly new one. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDespite the Nasdaq Composite climbing to a new all-time high on May 15, plain-as-day bargains among growth stocks can still be found. Opportunistic investors simply have to be willing to look for amazing deals.\n\nWhat follows are four incomparable growth stocks you might regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first matchless growth stock that's begging to be bought with the relatively young Nasdaq bull market stretching its legs is social media leader Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Though Meta's forecast for higher capital expenditures recently spooked Wall Street, it possesses a couple of well-defined competitive advantages that allow this short-term headwind to be easily brushed off.\n\nTo start with the obvious, Meta Platforms is the parent of many of the most-visited social sites globally. It owns Facebook (the most-visited social site), along with Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Facebook Messenger.\n\nCollectively, its family of apps drew 3.24 billion daily active users during the first quarter and close to 4 billion monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Advertisers are going to be hard-pressed to find a social media platform with a broader reach.\n\nTo add to the above, Meta benefits from disproportionately long periods of economic growth. Although advertising is highly cyclical and recessions are an unavoidable aspect of the economic cycle, periods of expansion last substantially longer than contractions. In simpler terms, long-term investors in ad-driven companies (Meta generates almost 98% of its sales from ads) are often handsomely rewarded.\n\nAnother reason current and prospective Meta investors shouldn't be too concerned with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's desire to spend on artificial intelligence (AI), the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices is the company's phenomenal war chest and cash flow. The company closed out March with more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated around $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations. As a cash cow, Zuckerberg's company has the luxury of investing for the future, even if the fruits of those investments won't be realized for years.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms' stock is still a phenomenal bargain. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times consensus cash flow for 2025, which represents a 12% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the previous five years.\n\nFiverr International\n\nA second incomparable growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq pushing to new highs is online-services marketplace Fiverr International(NYSE: FVRR). Despite worries that AI would adversely affect its operating performance, multiple dynamics appear to be working in the company's favor.\n\nAlthough Fiverr's stock has retraced more than 90% from its all-time high, the macro environment couldn't be more favorable for its long-term success. While some workers have returned to the office following the worst of the pandemic, more people than ever are working remotely. This sizable increase in mobile workers is just what the doctor ordered for Fiverr's gig-economy-driven platform for freelancers.\n\nAs I've pointed out in the past, Fiverr's transparency is another key selling point. Rather than follow in the footsteps of many of its peers and have freelancers price their services on an hourly basis, Fiverr has its freelancers provide an all-encompassing price for their tasks. This transparency is likely the fuel that keeps powering spending per buyer higher.\n\nBut the secret sauce that makes Fiverr International a stellar investment is its take rate -- i.e., the percentage of revenue it gets to keep from negotiated deals on its platform, including fees. Whereas most of its competition has a take rate in the mid to high teens, it closed out March with a take rate of 32.3%, up 190 basis points from the comparable period in 2023. The company is keeping more and generating successively higher spending per buyer.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Fiverr also unveiled a share-repurchase program for up to $100 million. Buying back stock could accelerate the growth in the company's double-digit adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical\n\nThe third unparalleled growth stock you'll likely be kicking yourself for not adding during the early innings of the new Nasdaq bull market is specialty biotech BioMarin Pharmaceutical(NASDAQ: BMRN). Although the launch of Roctavian, a one-time gene therapy treatment for patients with hemophilia A, has been marred by challenges (sales of the drug totaled just $800,000 in the first quarter), one bad apple isn't going to spoil BioMarin's juicy portfolio of novel therapies.\n\nBefore digging into product specifics, it's important to recognize that BioMarin focuses its efforts on drugs for ultra-rare diseases. While there are risks associated with small pools of patients, the rewards are plentiful. Namely, such drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) often face little or no pushback from insurers regarding their high list prices, and they usually have minimal or nonexistent competition.\n\nEven with Roctavian stumbling out of the gate, growth from dwarfism drug Voxzogo has more than made up for this fumble. Label expansion opportunities have broadened Voxzogo's use case, which in turn sent sales rocketing higher by 74% to nearly $153 million during the March-ended quarter. Increased uptake and strong pricing power should give Voxzogo a legitimate shot at eventually topping $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nBioMarin's management also recently made the decision to focus its efforts and capital on its most-promising experimental therapies. By narrowing its clinical studies to three candidates, the company aims to reduce its annual operating expenses by up to $40 million.\n\nWith more than a half-dozen FDA-approved drugs in its portfolio, BioMarin should be able to sustain double-digit sales and EPS growth through at least 2027. In fact, Wall Street's consensus calls for its EPS to catapult from a reported $0.87 in 2023 to almost $5 by 2027.\n\nWestern Digital\n\nA fourth incomparable growth stock you could regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is storage solutions specialist Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC). In spite of some spotty demand weakness from its consumer segment (i.e., personal computer sales have remained weak), numerous other aspects of Western Digital's operations are firing on all cylinders.\n\nThe first unmistakable catalyst is the AI revolution. Whereas artificial intelligence has created worry for some businesses, it's set to catapult demand for Western Digital. High-compute AI data centers require ever-growing computational needs, which in turn is going to accelerate demand for data-center storage solutions.\n\nSomething else to consider is that enterprise spending on cloud-based platforms is still in its early innings. As cloud spending ramps up, Western Digital's data-center storage products come into focus. Not surprisingly, the company's cloud segment was its biggest growth driver in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 29), with a year-over-year sales increase of 29%!\n\nPricing power and utility should also work in the business' favor. Although hard drives have long been a data center staple, Western Digital's NAND flash-memory solutions support higher transfer rates and consume less power. As NAND flash-memory adoption increases, the company's pricing power should improve.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that Western Digital's bottom line is set to do a major about-face. After the company reported a $3.59-per-share loss in fiscal 2023, Wall Street is looking for close to $8 in positive EPS next year. This is a company that should benefit for years to come from growth in the cloud and AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Major indices continue to climb Despite ongoing concerns over sticky inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical tensions. Many shares defy the traditional “sell in May and go away” adage. This trend leaves investors wondering which stocks to buy to ride the ongoing surge in equities.\n\nStudies show that the S&P 500 Index has enjoyed 27 bull markets between 1928 and 2023, with an average gain of nearly 115% over an average period of 2.7 years. From 1987 to 2000, the longest bull market achieved an impressive gain of 582%. In June 2023, the S&P 500 re-entered bull market territory, displaying strong momentum. Research provider CFRA recently raised its 12-month target to over 5,600, citing optimistic profit growth expectations.\n\nAlthough concerns persist about high valuations in the technology sector and the potential volatility surrounding the presidential election in November, market sentiment remains positive. Anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and earnings growth could create a favorable environment for further gains. Let’s explore three of the best stocks to buy, poised to benefit from the current market momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) provides medications across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including diabetes, cancer and chronic pain. Its strong product portfolio, consistent revenue growth, and potential for future breakthroughs make LLY stock the first name on our stock list.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Eli Lilly reported a remarkable 26% increase in revenue, primarily driven by the successful launch of new products like Mounjaro and Zepbound. Wall Street has been impressed with the pharma company’s ability to innovate and effectively bring new products to market.\n\nMeanwhile, its gross margin also saw an impressive rise from 78.4% in the first quarter of 2023 to 82.5% in the first quarter of this year. Eli Lilly benefited from higher prices and an improved product mix, underscoring the company’s operational efficiency and pricing power. Operating income in the same period grew by 63%, and earnings per share increased by 59%. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $42.4 billion and $43.6 billion. The company also anticipates further margin expansion.\n\nAs a result, LLY stock has advanced 30% year-to-date (YTD), hovering slightly below all-time highs. Yet, the shares are expensive, trading at 56 times forward earnings and 19 times sales. Nonetheless, Wall Street is expecting further gains from the pharma stock, as the 12-month average price stands at $877.50, presenting an upside potential of 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet (FN) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on our list of stocks to buy is Fabrinet (NYSE:FN). Its equipment enables the transmission of massive data volumes at high speeds. With data demand constantly rising and a wide range of services ranging from optical packaging to precision manufacturing, Fabrinet deserves your attention as a long-term investment.\n\nAnalysts point out that Fabrinet has demonstrated robust financial health with a market cap of $8.4 billion. In early May, management released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Exceeding guidance, quarterly revenue was $731.5 million, compared to $665.3 million for the same period 12 months ago. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $2.39, compared to $1.94 for the year-ago quarter.\n\nWall Street was pleased about the growth in optical communications revenues, particularly from datacom revenue, which grew 150% YOY. Management is optimistic about its position in the high data rate datacom market. Fabrinet’s operating and net profit margins currently stand at 9.6 and 9.9%, respectively. In other words, management has successfully navigated the competitive manufacturing landscape to maintain profitability.\n\nSince the start of the year, FN stock has returned 22%, rallying significantly after announcing better-than-expected financial results. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 26.2 times forward earnings and 3.1 times sales. Given the extent of the recent rally in Fabrinet shares, potential investors may consider waiting for a pullback towards the $220 level. Fabrinet will likely continue its growth trajectory in future quarters, making it a compelling stock to buy within the tech manufacturing sector.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) Blocks that spell out ETF in front of jar with money and change.\n\nSource: SHUN_J / Shutterstock\n\nLarge-cap growth stocks typically thrive in rapidly expanding industries like technology and biotech. Known for high growth rates and valuations, these companies are expected to outpace other established stocks. Such growth shares may offer a blend of stability and significant long-term potential, making them an important part of many portfolios.\n\nTherefore, the Vanguard Growth ETF is next on our list of stocks to buy (NYSEARCA:VUG). This fund allows investors to replicate the performance of leading large-cap U.S. growth stocks. Launched in January 2004, the ETF offers broad exposure to about 200 companies.\n\nOver half of VUG’s holdings are in technology stocks (56%), followed by consumer discretionary (19%), industrials (9%) and healthcare (8%) sectors. The top 10 holdings collectively account for over half of the fund’s net assets of $226 billion. Among the top names are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Visa (NYSE:V) and others.\n\nSince January, with a gain of over 11%, VUG has outperformed many individual stocks and the benchmark indices. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 10%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 5%. Currently, the VUG fund trades at 38 times trailing earnings and 10 times book value. With a competitive expense ratio of 0.04% and a modest 0.5% dividend yield, VUG remains an appealing option for investors seeking exposure to large-cap growth stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "7 Cheap S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is the most recognizable index in the stock market. Many investors use this index as a benchmark to determine if their portfolios are outperforming the stock market. The S&P 500 consists of profitable large-cap companies.\n\nWhile investing in an S&P 500 ETF can simplify your portfolio, these ETFs have a major downside. While you get plenty of good companies, you will also end up with a bunch of duds. Some corporations in the S&P 500 continue to drag the index lower, and it’s only a handful of stocks that keep the index charging higher.\n\nInvestors looking for some of the top S&P 500 stocks may want to consider these choices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) combines affordability with high growth. The stock trades at a 27 P/E ratio and reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2024. Net income more than doubled year-over-year which will make the P/E ratio more enticing in future quarters.\n\nAdvertising continues to generate the lion’s share of total revenue. More users are flocking to Meta Platforms’ family of apps, leading to a 37% year-to-date gain for the stock. Shares are up by 157% over the past five years.\n\nWhile those gains are impressive, Wall Street analysts believe there is more upside for this member of the magnificent seven. The average price target suggests a 10% upside is in the cards. Furthermore, it’s rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.\n\nMeta Platforms plays a big role in the S&P 500’s long-term gains. It’s one of the top holdings in the entire fund and has been rewarding long-term investors for many years.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech giant that is worth investors’ attention. It’s certainly won a lot of analysts over, as it has a projected 16% upside. Microsoft is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 33 analysts. The highest price target of $600 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 43%.\n\nThe stock is up by 14% year-to-date and has gained 229% over the past five years. The company’s Q3 FY24 results suggest that more gains are on the way. Microsoft reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth and 20% year-over-year net income growth in the quarter. Cloud revenue led the way with a 23% year-over-year increase.\n\nMicrosoft also exhibited impressive revenue growth for its other business segments, such as Productivity and Business Processes, Personal Computing, and other segments. Microsoft returned $8.4 billion to shareholders in the quarter through stock buybacks and dividends. The corporation is also expanding its lead in the artificial intelligence race which can create additional opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) has been steadily rising over several years. The stock is up by 9% year-to-date and have soared by 71% over the past five years. Credit and debit cards are the preferred payment choice for many consumers due to their convenience, security, and rewards. Visa makes a small percentage of every credit card transaction.\n\nThe business model has worked well for Visa. The firm regularly reports net profit margins north of 50%, along with solid revenue and earnings growth. Q2 FY24 revenue and net income both increased by 10% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share rallied up by 12% year-over-year.\n\nVisa can march higher due to strong financials and an impressive stock buyback program. The fintech firm put $3.8 billion into share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. The stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 12% upside. The highest price target of $340 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 21%.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) trades at a 31 P/E ratio and offers a 1.39% yield. The stock is up by 12% year-to-date and has gained 78% over the past five years.\n\nThe retailer has been selling affordable products for more than 60 years. It’s one of the most recognizable brands in the United States and regularly brings in revenue. The firm reported 5.7% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. E-commerce and advertising sales both exhibited higher growth rates which is a good sign for the company’s long-term revenue and net income growth.\n\nWalmart recently raised its dividend by 9% which is the highest dividend hike in more than a decade. It’s a step in the right direction that suggests more gains are on the way. Walmart is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” among 27 analysts. The stock also has a projected 11% upside from its current level.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is another top credit and debit card issuer that offers an excellent value proposition. Shares trade at a 20 P/E ratio despite double-digit revenue and earnings growth. The fintech firm reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth and 39% year-over-year diluted EPS growth in Q1 2024.\n\nProfit margins were in the double-digits and should continue to grow in the years ahead. Other credit card companies have much higher profit margins. However, if American Express can get its profit margins in the 20%-25% range within a few years, it can become a very compelling stock.\n\nThe price point already provides a good opportunity. It has a lower P/E ratio than its competitors despite posting better revenue and net income growth. American Express is also an impressive dividend growth stock. The company has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 10.51% over the past decade. Dividend growth has accelerated in recent years. The annualized dividend growth rate stands at 13.28% over the past three years.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nThe United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) has been delivering packages for more than 100 years. E-commerce has increased the demand for its services, but the stock has endured some rocky years. Shares are down by 6% year-to-date and have lost 12% over the past year. However, the stock is up by 50% over the past five years and offers a 4.38% yield.\n\nThe stock trades at a 22 P/E ratio and can be a good pick for dividend income investors. While investors shouldn’t expect substantial growth, the company also has less downside. People will still order products online during economic downturns and need UPS to deliver them.\n\nRevenue decreased slightly year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024. However, analysts are looking at the long-term picture and currently rate the stock as a “Moderate Buy.” The average price target suggests that UPS can gain an additional 8% from current levels.\n\nGarmin (GRMN) Garmin company logo on a storefront\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nGarmin (NYSE:GRMN) offers products in five key segments: fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, and automotive OEM. The company’s watches have become popular among many athletes who want to obtain more data for every workout, such as heart rate, mile pace, and other metrics.\n\nThe fitness and outdoor segments make up more than half of Garmin’s total revenue, and that distribution has worked out for the company. Q1 2024 revenue increased by 20% year-over-year as fitness sales let the way with a 40% year-over-year jump. Garmin also reported a 36% year-over-year increase in GAAP diluted EPS.\n\nThe stock trades at a 24 P/E ratio and offers a 1.76% yield. Dividend growth has been moderate at an annualized 5.07% over the past five years. While fitness and outdoor sales are the company’s key segments, investors should also monitor the company’s auto OEM sales. This segment grew by 58% year-over-year in Q1 2024.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

        "content": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.\n\nBut the interesting question to answer is: Is Meta really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller?\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 242\n\nAfter bagging huge profits from his Nvidia stake, billionaire Stanley Druckemiller is pouring money into the consumer-side AI companies that are using AI technologies to their advantage to boost and optimize online content consumption, including text, images and video. Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office bought a $31,043,000 stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nHow Does Meta Platforms Stand Out Among the AI Competition?\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), thanks to its multiple revenue streams and the huge user base it captures (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp), can leverage AI to its advantage in a much efficient way when compared to peers. For example, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) plans to use 'Llama 3' LLM to introduce new automation features in its business messaging on Facebook. This technology, called \"Business AIs\", would help consumers get answers to their questions and will speed up the buying process. Analysts believe this could give further boost to online shopping on the platform.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has also revealed Generative adversarial networks (GANs) technology to create images, text-to-video generative AI application called Make-A-Video and several other tools for consumers to play with AI, causing a rise in usage and engagement.\n\nMeta Using AI to Increase Engagement and Ads Revenue\n\nOn the backend, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is using AI for optimize ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Is META the best AI Stock\n\nMeta's Huge CapEx Will Payoff\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it'll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) management sensed the need to calm investors about this metric during the latest earnings call. Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) CFO Susan Li said:\n\nWe anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We’re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares have gained about 92% over the past one year.\n\nIs Meta Platforms Stanley Druckenmiller's Best AI Stock Pick?\n\nDespite the positive sentiment and growth catalysts, Insider Monkey's research shows that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is not the best AI stock to buy in Stanley Druckenmiller's portfolio.\n\nClick to see The Best AI Stock in Stanley Druckenmiller's Portfolio better than Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nYou can also see the complete list of Stanley Druckenmiller's 10 Best AI Stock Picks in 2024.\n\nDisclosure:None\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The generative AI revolution is far from over, but that doesn’t mean AI stocks, especially those that have enjoyed impressive gains in recent months, are immune to a substantial pullback. The bears and skeptics may have been calling for such a correction for quite some time. And though a growth-to-value rotation is always possible, I’m not so sure one will be on the table now that the Fed is done with the rate hikes.\n\nThough fewer rate cuts than expected could be in for the year (perhaps two or less), it seems like the higher-growth names, especially those with AI exposure, are worth picking up as long as you can justify the price of admission.\n\nWith some companies (like OpenAI) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) recently unveiling ample new AI features, tools, and projects, it’s getting harder to sit on the sidelines if you’re one of the folks who’ve been actively avoiding AI stocks, dismissing them because of their past-year rallies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we’ll go through three AI stocks that still look cheap, perhaps cheap enough to take on less damage come the next inevitable market correction.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet stock stands out as the cheapest Magnificent Seven member right now, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 22.9 times. If that’s not a cheap price to pay for magnificence in the realm of AI, I really don’t know what is.\n\nWith Google I/O 2024 wrapped up (the word “AI” was used more than 120 times in the two-hour presentation!), I think it’s time for investors to re-evaluate where the $2.12 trillion AI juggernaut stands.\n\nPersonally, I was impressed with I/O, which unveiled plenty of new AI innovations. As part of I/O, Google revealed its multimodal AI assistant, Project Astra, a product that should compete with OpenAI’s recently unveiled ChatGPT-4o. Additionally, it pulled the curtain on Veo, a text-to-video generator that seems to be the answer to OpenAI Sora. Google also announced its Search AI Overviews will be coming very soon.\n\nAfter such an AI-packed event, I find it absurd that GOOG stock isn’t well above the $180 mark. In any case, the stock looks cheap, and recent momentum looks tough to stand in the way of.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock is serious about spending money to advance its AI capabilities by leaps and bounds. While the social media and metaverse titan has been doing a fantastic job of innovating with its new Meta AI and LLaMA 3 models, it’s clear Mark Zuckerberg is not willing to pull any punches in the global AI battle. He wants to not only come out ahead but perhaps much ahead of the competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs it stands, Meta’s AI footing looks strong. As it starts spending heavily, future quarters could be in for upsetting surprises as costs pile up. However, in five years from now, I think AI could help Meta become a top-two growth stock in the Magnificent Seven cohort.\n\nSo, if you’re fed up with the dwindling growth prospects of some other Magnificent Seven stocks, META stock may be worth adding as we head into June. The stock’s not expensive either at 23.9 times forward P/E at writing.\n\nRecently, Meta turned out the lights on its Workplace app, an effort that should free up cash to spend on things like AI.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for a much smaller firm that could have greater AI upside, perhaps dating app firm Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) is more your cup of tea.\n\nThe company seems poised to make a huge splash in AI, a move that could change the way we think about matching and online dating. Indeed, dating apps aren’t exactly a great experience for many. Some may argue it’s based too much on looks, with less about other aspects (think personality) of a person that are arguably more important.\n\nBumble founder and ex-CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd believes “AI dating concierges” could play a big role in the future of dating. She discussed the incredible idea that AI could date on behalf of its customers during the Bloomberg Technology Summit. Undoubtedly, having AI find you the perfect match seems to be the holy grail of the dating app market. But for now, investors don’t seem all too impressed by the potential.\n\nI probably won’t be the first to mention that AI-powered matching seems to be eerily similar to an episode of Black Mirror. Imagine interacting with an AI and having it match you with someone with whom it thinks you’d have chemistry. That’s a ground breaker that could help get past the icebreaker. And I think the powerful idea is more than worth getting behind, especially while BMBL stock is in a historic rut.\n\nAt just shy of 1.0 times price-to-book (P/B), I find BMBL to be absurdly undervalued relative to its market opportunity to be had in the nascent AI dating scene.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "title": "Don’t Fret a Market Crash: 3 Recession-Resistant Stocks to Buy Before the Storm",
        "content": "Market turbulence happens.\n\nLately, it’s becoming clear that investors need to be focusing on recession-resistant stocks. Companies that provide stable cash flows and pay out dividends, or reinvest their capital into their core high-growth businesses, are likely to outperform. If macro headwinds pick up, it’s better to be safe than sorry. And while growth has outperformed value for quite some time, it’s true that over the long-term, this dynamic is typically reversed.\n\nWe could be headed into a period where companies that are fairly-valued and spit off tremendous cash flows are rewarded much more highly by the market. In that regard, I’ve picked three recession-resistant stocks that investors should consider. It doesn’t matter what happens to the market today or tomorrow. But if you expect some turbulence over the next year or two, these companies could be among the best picks to buy right now. (It’s also worth noting they should perform well in a booming economy as well, of course).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.\n\nSource: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the parent company of big fast food chains like Popeyes and Burger King, Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) has stood tall through market turbulence. Its presence and multi-brand strategies enhance its pricing power.\n\nRecently, Burger King sealed a deal with a $300 million investment, overhauling over 1,100 U.S locations. This becomes a big step in the fast food chain’s revitalization. Restaurant Brands made this move to focus more on modern facilities. Upgrades include new equipment, seating and a modernized look which includes ordering kiosks.\n\nThe $300 million investment extends the “Reclaim the Flame” strategy, launched in September 2022. Restaurant Brands International allocated $250 million for renovations, tech upgrades and new equipment. Then they threw in an extra $150 million for app enhancements and advertising. Early results show strong sales uplifts from completed remodels.\n\nOver time, consumers will continue to go out to eat. I expect more of a trade-down effect to chains operated by Restaurant Brands, if economic turmoil hits. This is a safe long-term bet to make in an uncertain market.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a Magnificent Seven stock, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has surged 194% since last year, showing its rebound growth. But just recently, META saw a 12% decrease after it announced plans to spend more on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMeta Platform’s profitability is notable, with consistently high revenue and substantial operating leverage. This is evident in its steady gross profit margins and free cash flow, providing financial flexibility for reinvestment. Also, the company revealed a raised 2024 capex guidance between $35 and $40 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe communications behemoth holds most social media platforms, with the big three, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, under their wing. However, it faces competition with YouTube and TikTok. Further, the company enhances its in-house chips, developing more data processing and advertising capabilities. This closed tech stack accelerates revenue opportunities for Meta Platforms.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nThe last one on the list of recession-proof stocks is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). Currently, most of Warren Buffett’s holdings are in massive blue-chip stocks that should weather any economic environment. Indeed, the Oracle of Omaha has built his portfolio in a recession-resistant way. He doesn’t like losing money, and that’s a strategy many investors hold as well.\n\nIn late 2023, Berkshire Hathaway sold a variety of stocks ranging from Stoneco., Markel, Globe Life and D.R Horton. Notably, the investing giant reduced its mammoth holdings in Apple, still retaining nearly 906 million shares. In addition, it trimmed its HP position while maintaining Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway’s energy exposure extends beyond Chevron (NYSE:CVX). It’s been increasing its stake in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), adding 19 million shares in the most recent quarter, totaling over 248 million. Buffett clarified Berkshire Hathaway won’t seek control of Occidental at the 2023 shareholder meeting.\n\nFor those bullish on Buffett’s investment wisdom (and that of his team), this is a stock to stick with through thick and thin.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Wedbush Just Slashed Its Price Target on These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Widely known for its coverage of popular growth stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), much like the old E.F. Hutton slogan, when Wedbush Securities talks, people listen. As such, many in the market may take caution with the stocks with lowered price targets that the sell-side firm covers.\n\nBut much like how unthinkingly following sell-side ratings may not necessarily result in success in the market, you may not want to assume that a stock with a lowered price target is doomed to produce poor returns.\n\nInstead, factors like lowered price targets are among many criteria to consider before making an investment decision.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let’s look at three stocks that have recently received lowered price targets from Wedbush.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWedbush has maintained a “neutral” rating on AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) since August 2023, when it raised its rating on the movie theater chain’s shares from “underperform.”\n\nOn May 9, however, the sell-side firm trimmed its price target on AMC stock from $4 to $3.50 per share. The trimming may slightly reduce, but this re-rating underscores Wedbush’s view on AMC’s underlying value. Arguably, one should take it as a sign to exercise caution following the recent wave of meme mania.\n\nThis speculative frenzy sent AMC from around $3 to as much as $11.88 per share this week. While the stock has since started crashing back down to prior price levels, more downside may lie ahead. Why? The market could bid AMC lower as it digests the company’s decision to raise more capital through the dilutive issuance and sale of new shares.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another name on the list of stocks with lowered price targets from Wedbush. According to The Fly, right after the Facebook parent’s latest quarterly earnings release last month, Wedbush maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock but lowered its price target from $570 to $480 per share.\n\nMETA stock has climbed back toward this revised price target following a post-earnings plunge. On one hand, Wedbush’s target makes sense. Shares currently trade for around 24.1 times earnings, on par with similar “Mag 7” stocks like Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nOn the other hand, if Meta continues to cut costs successfully and capitalize on generative AI, and if the digital ad market remains strong, it could hit the high end of earnings forecasts in 2025 ($26.50 per share). If this happens, shares could hit prices well above Wedbush’s prior price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is another one of the stocks with lowered price targets from Wedbush following a quarterly earnings release. The online entertainment platform operator beat expectations with its latest numbers, but analysts and investors were very disappointed in its updates to guidance.\n\nWith Roblox guiding for much lower adjusted revenue through the rest of 2024, it’s no surprise that RBLX stock fell 22% after the earnings release. It’s also unsurprising that Wedbush slashed its price target from $56 to $46 per share. The analyst firm, however, does continue to give shares an “outperform” rating.\n\nIn my view, even with this target cut, Wedbush remains generous in its assessment of Roblox. With the company continuing to report net losses, its current market cap of around $20.3 billion appears excessive. Unless growth quickly picks back up, it’s hard to see shares sustaining, much adding to this current valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Brace for a Market Crash With These 3 (Surprising) New Inflation Hedges",
        "content": "An inflation hedge protects against currency devaluation caused by rising prices. It involves investing in assets expected to maintain or increase value. Hedging can prevent investment losses due to inflation, which reduces the real return.\n\nFor instance, the real return is negative if a stock yields 5%, but inflation is 6%. Inflation-hedged assets may retain high value despite lower intrinsic worth as investors seek them out.\n\nWhen people talk about their money not stretching as far, they’re referring to inflation affecting their earnings or wealth. Inflation reduces purchasing power, so individuals aim for earnings and investments to outpace it, allowing them to afford more, even with rising prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach state has its own inflation rate, influenced by its economy and fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation can affect specific areas like gas or food costs and comes in three types: demand-pull, cost-push and built-in inflation.\n\nThat said, here are three new inflation hedges that people are going crazy about.\n\nNvidia Is the New Gold\n\nOne of the most traditional inflation hedges is gold. It has been a top inflation hedge since 1971; during the Great Recession, gold became so popular despite its volatility and short-term uncertainties. Banks believe that having more gold is better, and thus, they bought more of it in 2022 than in 1967.\n\nEven in 2024, inflation is still an ongoing concern, and it has been causing delays in Fed rate cuts. As per Bloomberg, investors are turning to big tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. However, gold remains the preferred inflation hedge.\n\nIn the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents viewed significant U.S. tech stocks as a hedge against inflation alongside gold. At the same time, 46% favored gold and nearly a third chose tech giants.\n\nSurvey respondents favored tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as the best hedge against inflation, highlighting their dominant role in the U.S. markets. Their steady profits and growth instill investor confidence in continued gains. Though reduced from 2022 highs, inflation still concerns investors, with 59% citing it as the top market risk. The following CPI reading is anticipated to sit at 3.4% year-over-year.\n\nThree years ago, inflation skyrocketed past 2%, and Nvidia surged six times. Other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also outperformed the S&P 500 market by 50%. Although, like other tech stocks, they can be sensitive to inflation and changes in inflation rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia marked a milestone and surged over 200%. The stock has exceeded $900 per share. In February, it awed the market through its excellent earnings report. The company showed $22 billion in revenue through generative AI and H100 GPUs. It also helped Nvidia get a seat at the trillion-dollar market cap hierarchy.\n\nInvesting in Farmlands\n\nInstitutional investors historically used agricultural land as an inflation hedge, but it must often be made available to most investors. In 2023, pension funds and tax-exempt vehicles held about 1,331 U.S. farmland properties worth $16.2 billion. Retail investors can access farmland assets through publicly traded REITs like Farmland Partners (NYSE:FPI) and Gladstone Land (NASDAQ:LAND).\n\nFarmland historically performs well during high inflation due to its positive correlation and real asset nature. It correlates more strongly with the CPI and Producer Price Index than other investments. Real assets, including farmland, typically outperform traditional assets during inflation, with nominal value growth. Farmland has seen year-over-year price decreases only once since 1987, indicating value preservation despite inflation.\n\nFarmland scarcity serves as a natural inflation hedge. The United States lost over 11 million acres in 20 years, and could still lead to more acres by 2050. Farmland proved otherwise, as it averaged an 11% annual return from years 1992 through 2020. It appreciates while generating operating cash flow, supported by the constant demand for food.\n\nFarmland is a unique real estate investment that provides stable income and resilience across economic cycles. Moreover, the returns from farmland are not correlated with public markets. That makes them unaffected during economic shifts.\n\nAlthough investing in farmland can be crucial due to decreasing arable land and global population, it is still worth an investment. In fact, regenerative agricultural practices make farmlands look enticing for investors.\n\nPut Up a Chicken Wings Business\n\nChicken is reclaiming its place as a favorite food choice for Americans. With beef prices increasing, people are opting for more chicken wings at fast-food restaurants and frozen tenders at grocery stores. Meat companies like Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and Pilgrim’s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) are seeing increased profits from poultry due to rising demand and lower costs for livestock feed.\n\nRetail sales of all U.S. chicken products rose by 3% for the year ending April 21, while pork and beef sales slightly declined. With food spending at a three-decade high, consumers opt for cheaper private-label items and cut back on branded purchases. Tyson executives noted shoppers prioritizing essentials over beef and expensive brands, but the duration of this trend remains to be determined.\n\nMoreover, unstable U.S. cattle supply leads meatpackers like Tyson to pay more for livestock, raising wholesale and retail meat prices. Tyson executives noted ranchers still need to begin rebuilding herds. Ground beef retail prices surged approximately 12% in March compared to a year ago, with Tyson’s CEO attributing strong chicken demand to more discerning consumers.\n\nFabio Sandri, CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride, noted a shift to cheaper chicken items on restaurant menus. Despite overall restaurant foot traffic declines, Pilgrim’s fast-food chain sales rose 6% in the latest quarter. Shares in the second-largest chicken processor surged approximately 60% over the past year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInflation decreases purchasing power, limiting what one can buy with the same money. That may lead to borrowing or reduced spending on non-essential items. If one’s income keeps up with inflation, there’s less for investments or discretionary spending.\n\nAdditionally, inflation may trigger a recession by reducing consumer spending and prompting interest rate hikes to curb inflation, slowing borrowing and business activity.\n\nCommon inflation hedges include gold, commodities, a balanced 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, REITs, rental income, the S&P 500 and TIPS. Or, you may also want to invest more in Nvidia, farmlands or perhaps put up a chicken wing business while it’s cheap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Stream Dream Team: 3 Media Stocks Conquering the Content Cosmos",
        "content": "Identifying the right media stocks to buy can offer long-term portfolios both growth and diversification. Streaming services continue to transform the media consumption landscape, as streaming content currently accounts for the biggest driver of TV usage. Research suggests consumer dissatisfaction with paying for unused TV channels has accelerated the rise of streaming services. Many households now customize their content and, in some cases, even reduce costs. With more viewers shifting toward on-demand content, nearly every U.S. household currently subscribes to one or more streaming platforms.\n\nHowever, leading streamers face significant challenges in acquiring new subscribers, as they need to spend vast sums on content generation to retain subscriber growth. Yet, some streamers are better positioned than others to maintain their lead in this competitive industry. Personalized viewing experiences and global accessibility continue to propel streaming platforms forward. As a result, the focus is increasingly on companies in charge of content creation and distribution. With that information, here are the most compelling media stocks to buy in the second half 2024.\n\nGlobal X Social Media ETF (SOCL)\n\nSource: ©iStock.com/Melpomenem\n\nWe start discussing media stocks to buy with the Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL). This exchange-traded fund offers investors a unique opportunity to tap into the dynamic growth of the social media sector. SOCL aggregates a diverse portfolio of companies that play a key role in shaping online communication, streaming, advertising and media sharing. These businesses are primed to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI), e-commerce and advanced data analytics. These tools are helping management teams create new revenue streams that enhance user interaction and platform development.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe fund, which currently invests in 47 social media stocks worldwide, was first listed in November 2011. Regarding sectoral allocation, communication services shares account for 96% of the fund. Then, we see several names from information technology, consumer discretionary and financial sectors.\n\nThe top 10 stocks comprise around two-thirds of $147 million in net assets. Among the leading holdings in the fund are the China-headquartered Tencent(OTCMKTS:TCEHY), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Naver (OTCMKTS:NHNCF), Kuaishou Technology (OTCMKTS:KUASF) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP).\n\nSOCL is up nearly 10% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at 20.2x and 2.4x. Investors who expect global streaming and digital advertising spending to remain strong could consider buying the dip in the SOCL ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix(NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up on our list of media stocks to buy is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). With its pioneering model and continuous innovation, Netflix has maintained its position at the forefront of the streaming wars. The company boasts a massive subscriber base of over 270 million paid memberships across more than 190 countries.\n\nAnalysts were pleased with the first quarter fiscal 2024 results, which surpassed expectations, highlighting Netflix’s significant pricing power in the streaming space. Revenue jumped 15% year-over-year (YOY) to $9.4 billion. In addition, Netflix added 9.3 million paid memberships, pushing its global subscriber base to 270 million. Operating income also jumped 54% YOY, while earnings per share (EPS) skyrocketed 83% to $5.28.\n\nApart from cutting costs, the crackdown on password sharing and introducing an ad-supported tier have effectively monetized its extensive user base and diversified revenue streams. The ad-supported tier delivered 65% quarter-over-quarter membership growth as consumers shifted towards cheaper options to use their streaming services.\n\nNetflix management’s focus on diverse content, strategic international expansions and ventures into new entertainment formats like gaming and live sports make NFLX stock a compelling long-term investment. Management guided robust revenue growth and profitability in fiscal year 2024, anticipating operating margin expansion in the second quarter.\n\nYear-to-date, NFLX stock is up 27%. Yet, shares are priced at a premium valuation of 33.5 times forward earnings and 7.7 times trailing sales. Meanwhile, analysts’ 12-month average price target suggests an upside potential of 6% from current levels.\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nWe discuss media stocks to buy with the audio-streaming giant Spotify (NYSE:SPOT). Many on Wall Street concur that the company has redefined digital music streaming, holding more than 30% of the market share in this space.\n\nThe audio-streaming company reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 results thanks to Spotify’s leadership in audio content. Revenue increased 20% YOY to 3.6 billion euros, driven by an increase in premium subscribers and an effective cost management strategy. Operating margin expanded by 243 basis points, while EPS jumped 162% YOY to 97 euro cents.\n\nSpotify continues to diversify its revenue streams through strategic price adjustments and expansion into new markets. Planned price hikes in key markets and introducing new subscription tiers are expected to boost revenue growth and market share. Meanwhile, Spotify is expanding beyond the North American and European markets. Users outside these core regions account for 54% of total monthly active users.\n\nImproved margins and increased focus on efficiency contribute to Spotify’s robust earnings backdrop in 2024. Analysts forecast strong momentum in premium subscriptions to accelerate earnings growth. Premium subscribers grew 14% YOY in the first quarter to 239 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nSPOT stock has doubled in value over the past year, with a notable 58% increase YTD. As a result, shares command a premium valuation at 59 times forward earnings and 3.8 times trailing sales. Nonetheless, Wall Street still remains optimistic, with an average price target of $352, an upside potential of over 16%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Threads, the text-focused social network from Meta Platforms Inc., is testing its own version of TweetDeck, a feature once popular with Twitter users that let them see several content feeds on one screen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US ‘Containment’ Jamie Dimon Sees ‘Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us’ China Unveils Broad Rescue Package to Prop Up Housing Market\n\nThreads users in the test group can pin as many as 100 feeds to their homepage, making it easy to jump between posts from people you follow, posts recommended by the company’s algorithms, or feeds focused on specific keywords or topics. The new layout is only available for users accessing Threads on the web.\n\nThe new experience is similar to TweetDeck, a feature long beloved by Twitter diehards. TweetDeck, which was originally created by outside developers before being acquired by the company in 2011, was popular enough that Twitter management considered selling it to users as part of a subscription offering on several occasions over the years, but never ended up charging for it.\n\nAfter Elon Musk acquired Twitter in late 2022, he changed the name of TweetDeck to X Pro and added it to the company’s subscription offering. Threads, meanwhile, is not charging for its new TweetDeck lookalike product, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nMeta debuted Threads last July as a response to Musk’s purchase of Twitter, with Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg saying he hoped the service would eventually reach a billion users. Zuckerberg said in April that Threads has more than 150 million monthly active users.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’ How the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Milei Targets Labor Law That’s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance The DNA Test Delusion Europe’s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The tech sector is one of the hottest sectors of the economy right now, and it can impact the overall market sentiment. With strong earnings reports, several tech stocks were up and this benefited many others. Similarly, the upcoming Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings are expected to benefit the entire market and could take other tech stocks higher. The future is Artificial Intelligence, and there is no stopping its momentum. Smart investors are always on the watch out for AI stocks to buy.\n\nSeveral companies are highly regarded in the industry for their AI investments, and they have seen the top and bottom line improve over the past 12 months. There are AI stocks with ample upside potential, and if you want to join the hype, here are the three stocks with strong buy ratings to consider. Yes, analyst ratings aren’t certain and things do not always go as expected. However, there is a strong chance of an upside for these three stocks mentioned here. Let’s look at the three options.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAll eyes are on Nvidia this month as the company is set to report the first-quarter results next week. A standout winner in the artificial intelligence (AI) race so far, there is no other company that can come close to its market domination right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrading at $946 today, NVDA stock has enjoyed a massive rally and is up 96% year-to-date. I’d recommended the stock when it was trading at $178 in 2023, and if you had bought it then, you’d be sitting on incredible gains today.\n\nNvidia is still a buy before the company reports results because the stock had rallied after the results, and it could happen again. The management is aiming for a revenue of $24.0 billion, up from $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts are pounding the table on Nvidia stock because there is an expectation that the results will boost the stock.\n\nWith its massive market share and the growing demand for AI chips, Nvidia is set to rule in 2024. Wells Fargo has a price target of $1,150 for the share and considers the earnings as a catalyst for the company. HSBC has a buy rating with a price target of $1,350 while Jefferies has a price target of $1,200 with a buy rating.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a highly-overlooked AI stock that is slowly making big moves. Up 16% YTD, ORCL stock is exchanging hands for $121 as of writing. The company’s generative AI is leading cloud infrastructure. It saw a 25% YOY jump in cloud revenue in the third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, its outstanding performance obligations also jumped 29% YOY and now stand at $80 billion. The management stated that about 43% of this will be recognized as revenue over the year. More recently, Oracle has been moving higher on reports of a $10 billion deal with Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI. The company is in talks to rent Oracle servers, but there is no confirmation yet. The stock was up 3% after the news.\n\nAs organizations continue to transition toward cloud, Oracle will see an increase in demand. The company is expanding its global footprint and is building 100 data centers. It has partnerships with some of the biggest tech companies including Nvidia which will boost the stock.\n\nOracle has an average price target of $136 from 24 analysts. It is a 12.84% upside from the current level. Out of the 24 analysts, 18 have a strong buy rating for the stock. Buy ORCL stock before it skyrockets.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt is still not too late to buy Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The company reported impressive financials with a 117% YOY net income growth and a 27% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter.\n\nIts daily active users stood at 3.24 billion across all the platforms which is a 7% YOY growth. Driven by the rising advertising revenue, the company has found a strong footing in the industry.\n\nThe company is using generative AI tools to work with advertisers. This allows them to see higher ad views and conversions. Meta is working on building more advanced AI models to cater to the global audience.\n\nIt has $58.1 billion in cash which allows the company to keep investing in AI projects like building new data centres or hiring top talent. The revenue from its AI-powered products has also grown, and it is using AI aggressively to achieve user satisfaction. Meta is one of the best AI stocks to buy right now.\n\nExchanging hands for $481, META stock is up 39% YTD and 44% in the last six months. The stock has a strong buy rating with the highest price target of $593, a 26% upside from the current level. META has a lot of potential and innovation abilities to meet the changing needs of the audience. This is one stock that is set to keep roaring higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Meta submitted a risk assessment report in September.\n\n\"The Commission is concerned that the systems of both Facebook and Instagram, including their algorithms, may stimulate behavioural addictions in children, as well as create so-called 'rabbit-hole effects',\" the EU executive said in a statement.\n\n\"In addition, the Commission is also concerned about age-assurance and verification methods put in place by Meta.\" The regulator's concerns relate to children accessing inappropriate content.\n\nMeta said it already has a number of online tools to protect children.\n\n\"We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them,\" a Meta spokesperson said.\n\n\"This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.\"\n\nMeta is already in the EU's crosshairs over election disinformation, a key concern ahead of crucial European Parliament elections next month.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The European Union opened fresh investigations Thursday into Facebook and Instagram over suspicions that they're failing to protect children online, in violation of the bloc's strict digital regulations for social media platforms.\n\nIt's the latest round of scrutiny for parent company Meta Platforms under the 27-nation EU's Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations that took effect last year with the goal of cleaning up online platforms and protecting internet users.\n\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it's concerned that the algorithmic systems used by Facebook and Instagram to recommend content like videos and posts could “exploit the weaknesses and inexperience” of children and stimulate “addictive behaviour.\" It's worried that these systems could reinforce the so-called “rabbit hole” effect that leads users to increasingly disturbing content.\n\nThe commission is also looking into Meta's use of age verification tools to prevent children from accessing Facebook or Instagram, or be shown inappropriate content. Only children aged 13 and older are allowed to use the platforms. It's also looking into whether the company is complying with DSA rules requiring a high level of privacy, safety and security for minors.\n\n“We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them,\" Meta said in a prepared statement. \"This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.”\n\nThey're the latest DSA cases to focus on child protection under the DSA, which requires platforms to put in place stringent measures to protect minors. The commission opened two separate investigations earlier this year into TikTok over concerns about risks to kids.\n\n“We are not convinced that Meta has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations — to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms Facebook and Instagram,” European Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a social media post.\n\nThe cases announced Thursday aren't the first for Facebook and Instagram. They're are already being investigated under the DSA over concerns they're not doing enough to stop foreign disinformation ahead of EU elections next month.\n\nSocial media platform X and ecommerce site AliExpress are also being investigated over their compliance with the EU rules.\n\nThere's no deadline for the investigations to wrap up. Violations could result in fines of up to 6% of a company’s annual worldwide revenue.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 7 Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "If you’re on the hunt for stocks to buy this month, look no further. We’re close to the end of first-quarter 2024 earnings season, with 92% of S&P 500 companies having reported results. While the overall earnings season has been strong, there are certain stocks that have emerged as favorites among Wall Street analysts. The consensus surrounding some companies and their stocks has strengthened following strong Q1 prints and bullish guidance.\n\nGoing forward, stocks that have been given top ratings and aspirational price targets on Wall Street can be expected to outperform the broader market, providing big gains to shareholders. As such, investors would be well-advised to pay attention to analyst ratings as they provide direction on the likely future moves of stocks. Here are Wall Street favorites: seven stocks with strong buy ratings for May 2024.\n\nStocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been in investor jail ever since the social media giant issued disappointing forward guidance as part of its Q1 earnings report. But analysts still love the stock. The 41 professionals covering the company rate META stock a strong buy and have a median price target on the shares of $522.49. That’s 11% higher than the current share price. Analysts agree that the Q1 print and outlook were both pretty good.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt best the guidance provided by Meta Platforms was conservative. And it shouldn’t take away from the fact that the company crushed its Q1 print. Meta reported EPS of $4.71 versus $4.32 that was expected among analysts. Earnings more than doubled from $2.20 per share a year earlier. Revenue in Q1 totaled $36.46 billion compared to $36.16 billion expected on Wall Street. Sales saw their fastest rate of expansion since 2021.\n\nWhile META stock is down about 10% since its Q1 print was delivered, the company’s share price has nearly doubled (up 97%) in the last 12 months.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is a company that reported truly disappointing Q1 numbers, sending its stock down 8% as a result. Yet analyst continue to rate UBER stock a strong buy. The median price target on shares of the ride hailing and delivery company is $89.21, implying 37% upside from current levels. Wall Street analysts continue to believe in the company and the growth opportunity before it.\n\nFor Q1, Uber reported a loss of 32 cents per share on revenue of $10.13 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of 22 cents a share and sales of $10.10 billion. The company blamed the poor results on losses related to the “revaluation of equity investments.” There were some bright spots in the print. Gross bookings increased 20% from the previous year, while revenue in the mobility segment increased 30% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nStory continues\n\nUber recently announced a new partnership with the grocery delivery app Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) that it says could benefit its delivery business going forward. Despite the recent dip, UBER stock has gained 71% in the past 12 months.\n\nStocks to Buy: Walt Disney Co. (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nWalt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) is back in the good graces of analysts as it controls costs and profitably grows its streaming service. A total of 24 analysts have a consensus strong buy rating on DIS stock with a median price target of $133.55, which is 27% higher than where the shares are currently changing hands. Disney’s recent Q1 print showed that the Mouse House is continuing to reduce losses at its streaming services.\n\nDisney said that its operating income rose 17% as its Disney+ and Hulu streaming services turned a profit in the quarter for the first time. When combined with ESPN+, the streaming business lost $18 million during the quarter. But that was much better than a loss of $659 million a year earlier. Disney+ subscribers grew by more than six million in the quarter to 117.6 million global customers.\n\nWhile still well below its all-time highs, DIS stock has gained 16% so far this year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is rated a strong buy among 33 analysts who track the company’s progress. Analysts continue to like the opportunity AMD has in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) microchips, and have a median price target on the company’s shares of $192.40, which is 26% higher than where the stock is trading now. With its recent Q1 earnings, AMD ratcheted up its forecast for AI microchip sales this year.\n\nThe company now expects to sell $4 billion worth of AI chips in 2024, up from a previous estimate of $3.5 billion forecast in January of this year. AMD said revenue at its Data Center unit grew 80% YOY to $2.3 billion due to robust sales of its latest MI300 series AI chips. The company said it has sold more than $1 billion of the AI chips since they launched about six months ago.\n\nOn their earnings call, management said that the company is working on new AI chips and successors to the current generation of processors. AMD stock is up 10% so far in 2024.\n\nStocks to Buy: GE Aerospace (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) is a fairly new company after a massive reorganization and divestment. However, analysts like what they see so far from the industrial conglomerate. Sixteen analysts rate GE stock a strong buy with a median price target of $179.13. The price target implies 12% growth over the next year. Most of the price targets have come after GE Aerospace, which specializes in aircraft engines, reported a Q1 profit that beat estimates and raised its forward guidance.\n\nGE Aerospace reported EPS of 82 cents, which beat consensus estimates of 65 cents. Revenue in Q1 totaled $15.2 billion, which was slightly below Wall Street estimates of $15.3 billion. However, GE raised its forward guidance and announced that it is increasing its quarterly dividend payment by a whopping 250%. This after General Electric hived off both its energy and healthcare businesses into separate public companies.\n\nGE stock has increased 60% on the year.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a top pick among analysts. A total of 41 Wall Street professionals give the stock a consensus strong buy rating with a median price target of $220.00 per share. The price target is 18% higher than current levels. Analysts praise Amazon for its cost controls as well as the growth we’re seeing in online advertising and cloud computing.\n\nWith its Q1 financial results, Amazon noted that Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit, now accounts for 62% of the company’s total operating profit. Advertising sales surged 24% during the quarter from a year earlier. The ad business grew faster in Q1 than either retail sales or cloud computing, and is an important profit driver for Amazon.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts and media, Amazon executives said that demand for generative AI should bolster the company’s cloud computing business going forward. AMZN stock is up 25% year-to-date.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCryptocurrency miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has a strong buy rating and a median price target of $18.72, which is nearly double (91% higher) then where shares are at currently. Despite a downturn in crypto prices, analysts seem to like the outlook for Riot Platforms, especially as the latest Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event is now behind us and as a raft of new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity.\n\nIn the lead up to the halving event, which is when the supply of Bitcoin is cut by 50%, RIOT stock fell as much as 40%. The stock has recovered some in recent weeks but is still down 36% on the year. Analysts expect a big recovery in Riot Platforms stock in coming months. There is also expected to be consolidation among crypto miners as the available supply of BTC dwindles, and Riot Platforms is seen as well-positioned to come out on top.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Pursuing long-term prosperity often leads one to investigate blue-chip stocks, which are industry leaders in stability, resiliency, and potential for long-term growth. Indeed, there are three major opportunities in this field. With its strategic focus on capacity expansion and technological progress, the first one may capitalize on emerging market opportunities. Moreover, its leadership in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems shows its technological superiority and revenue resilience.\n\nConversely, the second is a shining example of sound financial management and effective operations. As a cornerstone investment in the semiconductor sector, the company’s dedication to shareholder returns and its planned worldwide manufacturing development strategy strengthen its reputation. It also boasts numerical solid measures, such as a gross margin and a great return on equity (ROE).\n\nLastly, the third company is leveraging AI to revolutionize user experiences and boost income through targeted advertising. Its leadership in interactive media and service monetization possibilities is driven by AI-powered recommendation systems that significantly enhance ad interaction. These companies are embracing fundamentals that have the potential to shape the industry for decades to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) focuses on strategic investments in capacity ramp and technological innovation. This is to edge on the upcoming market shifts (like AI chips). Notably, H2 2024 will be better, continuing the upward trend of the semiconductor sector. Furthermore, secular market trends and rising demand for advanced semiconductor nodes continue to support ASML’s positive growth forecast.\n\nAdditionally, the EUV systems of ASML are essential to its ability to generate income. The business supplied 12 EUV systems in Q1 2024, bringing in EUR 1.8 billion in revenue. Furthermore, the order book shows net system bookings of EUR 3.6 billion during the same time, showing consistent demand. The industry’s transition to more sophisticated semiconductor production techniques and ASML’s technological capabilities are demonstrated by the growing deployment of EUV systems. Because of their higher capabilities, EUV systems fetch premium pricing, considerably boosting ASML’s revenue and profit margins.\n\nLastly, the company’s strong bottom line exceeded projections in Q1 2024, with a gross margin of 51%. Operational efficiency and a good product mix are credited for this profit growth. Thus, the business made EUR 1.2 billion in net profits or 23.1% of total net sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nQ1 2024 saw an improvement in TSMC’s (NYSE:TSM) gross margin to 53.1% and operating margin to 42%. Further, ROE hit 25.4%, while EPS was at TWD8.7. TSMC has a competitive lead and sharp cost management, indicating solid margins and smooth operations. Fundamentally, a high ROE suggests that the company may make significant profits.\n\nMoreover, by making large expenditures in fabrication facilities located in Arizona, Japan, and Europe, TSMC is proactively growing its manufacturing footprint. Notably, 2024’s capital budget may fall between $28 billion and $32 billion. By diversifying its manufacturing sites and utilizing its global flexibility, TSMC hopes to reduce geopolitical risks. It will also improve responsiveness to customer demands and seize new growth possibilities. This development strengthens the company’s lead in semiconductors and aligns with its long-term growth plan.\n\nFinally, TSMC’s cash from operations in Q1 was TWD436 billion. TWD181 billion was spent on capital expenditures, with sophisticated process technologies receiving a sizable share. Therefore, the corporation can finance significant technological development and expansion expenditures because of its solid cash-generation capabilities.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) uses AI to improve the user experience and increase revenue. The business delivers more relevant advertising using AI-driven recommendation algorithms, which raises ad engagement and revenue. AI is recommended for over 50% of Instagram content and almost 30% of Facebook feed posts, demonstrating its increasing impact on content discovery and consumption.\n\nAdditionally, Meta has a long-term top-line lead, reflected in solid revenue growth, effective cost control, and strong cash flow production. The company generated $36.5 billion in total sales in Q1 2024, a 27% rise from Q1 2023. Further, the revenue composition holds a diversified sales mix, with logic accounting for 63% and memory accounting for 37% of net system sales. Despite rising costs, Meta has a healthy financial position with $58.1 billion in cash and an operating margin of 38%.\n\nLastly, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns—which have seen a huge increase in income, more than tripling from the previous year—are among the AI-powered solutions that Meta Platforms offers. Therefore, automating campaign preparation and enhancing ad effectiveness, these technologies help advertisers increase their clients’ return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in ASML, TSM and META.

Meta submitted a risk assessment report in September.\n\n\"The Commission is concerned that the systems of both Facebook and Instagram, including their algorithms, may stimulate behavioural addictions in children, as well as create so-called 'rabbit-hole effects',\" the EU executive said in a statement.\n\n\"In addition, the Commission is also concerned about age-assurance and verification methods put in place by Meta.\" The regulator's concerns relate to children accessing inappropriate content.\n\nMeta is already in the EU's crosshairs over election disinformation, a key concern ahead of crucial European Parliament elections next month. DSA violations can lead to fines of as much as 6% of a company's annual global turnover.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Cheap Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The rest of 2024 could be a breakout period for cheap Russell 2000 stocks. Thus far, the index posted a 3.6% gain since January, though it lags the S&P 500’s 10% bump. However, incoming tides might favor small-caps, setting the stage for a record run among cheap Russell 2000 stocks.\n\nInvestors are increasingly wary that investing in a large-cap index like the S&P 500 overexposes them to a few high-performing stocks that skew total returns. This concern is valid, as the “Magnificent 7” stocks make up nearly 30% of the overall index and, until recently, accounted for most of its gains compared to the relatively flat performance of the other 493 stocks. While the rest of the index catches up, investors still face company and sector-specific risks by holding concentrated tech positions in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and the other top S&P 500 stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, potential rate cuts or at least a prolonged pause could benefit small-caps needing growth capital. High debt costs have hindered small-cap borrowing, and investor cash not allocated to mega-caps has largely remained in money market funds. Although investors are gradually returning to stocks, nearly $6 trillion still sits in these funds. This dynamic created a vicious cycle for small-caps, struggling to attract investor interest compared to an attractive 5% (or more) fixed-income yield through money market accounts, high-yield savings, and bond ETFs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, this situation is changing, and these seven cheap Russell 2000 stocks stand to benefit the most.\n\nValley National Bancorp (VLY) A pink piggy bank sitting on three stacked textbooks with a green chalkboard in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs Fed rate cuts slowly take effect, banking stocks will move in one of two directions. Companies with limited debt or sufficient size to manage it, such as legacy mega-banks, will likely see their shares decline as net interest income dries up. Conversely, smaller regional banks with higher relative leverage and local real estate lending operations will benefit from lower borrowing rates and increasing consumer loan interest. Among these regional banks, Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) stands out as a particularly cheap Russell 2000 stock.\n\nValley National’s stock trades at a low 0.6x book value and 8x earnings, making it undervalued and inarguably cheap. Its strong balance sheet and low debt load, reflected in a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56 compared to the industry average of 1.2, demonstrate the bank’s lower leverage relative to competitors. The bank’s recent stock buyback initiative and a 5.7% trailing dividend yield further underscore its financial health.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts widely agree that Valley National is undervalued. Consensus estimates assign an average price target of $9.44, about 20% above its current share price. In addition to this bullish outlook, sentiment around the bank’s stock is improving, with around half of analysts now recommending a “hold,” a significant increase from the 50% who advised selling in the previous evaluation period.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Duolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a hidden gem in the education tech sector. Despite its shares more than doubling last year, it’s dipped 16% since January and 27% in the past week. However, given its strengths, the current dip presents a buying opportunity. Initially, there were doubts about the commercial viability of its mobile language learning apps. Still, Duolingo is proving its viability as an EdTech stock and a (relatively) cheap Russell 2000 stock contender.\n\nThe key to its success lies in its popularity among customers. Several factors contribute to its widespread appeal, including the increasing reliance on smartphones, the effectiveness of self-directed learning, engaging gamification elements, and lingering post-pandemic habits.\n\nDuolingo’s latest earnings report showed a 5447 year-over-year surge in subscription rates, generating $161 million for the quarter. The number of paid subscribers rose to 7.4 million, marking a 54% year-over-year increase. Building on this success, Duolingo recently announced plans to expand its educational offerings to include music and math lessons.\n\nAlthough some argue that Duolingo’s market valuation is too high, similar criticisms were once directed at Nvidia. With virtually no rivals matching its position, Duolingo is well-positioned to maintain its dominance into 2024 — this cheap Russell 2000 stock won’t remain so for long.\n\nUFP Industries (UFPI) Wooden planks stacked in a warehouse\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) is a lumber supply company that supports housing manufacturers. This cheap Russell 2000 stock stands to benefit from real estate trends rapidly changing as markets reach a “new normal” paradigm of higher-for-longer.\n\nAfter a significant slump throughout 2022 and most of 2023, new housing starts are stabilizing. This continued expansion indicates renewed enthusiasm for new builds in a still-hot real estate market. Although existing home prices stagnated and fell, developers seized the opportunity to attract middle-market homebuyers by offering new homes priced below market estimates and providing attractive financing deals to counter high mortgage rates.\n\nThis strategic move boosts UFP’s lumber supply operation. Additionally, the company’s solid fundamentals distinguish it from competitors. With a price-to-sales ratio of 1, investor enthusiasm is well-aligned with practical revenue targets. UFP’s cash flow is strong, with $788 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months. The company is also virtually debt-free, maintaining a healthy cash and net asset balance. These robust fundamentals position UFP to capitalize on evolving trends while providing a cushion against economic downturns or industry supply chain shocks, even as rate cut prospects remain uncertain.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Fabrinet (FN) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nThough often overlooked, Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) is becoming a key player among cheap Russell 2000 stocks, riding the artificial intelligence wave but sufficiently differentiated to avoid major competitive action. As a major upstream supplier for leading firms like Nvidia, it provides essential components for modern technology. Fabrinet’s product range is broad, but its fiber optic cable segment is the cheap Russell 2000 stock’s shining star.\n\nThe company produces cutting-edge, ultra-high-speed fiber optic cables that enable rapid communication between computers and hardware systems at speeds exceeding 800 GB per second. These cables facilitate swift, large-scale data transfers for AI-focused firms like Nvidia but also serve cloud computing and generalized data storage and management purposes. This segment of Fabrinet’s business currently generates about $500 million in revenue, with projections indicating a potential doubling of operational income in the coming years.\n\nShares surged recently, hitting a 22% gain since January and 150% over the past year. That momentum seems to be continuing, making it one of the best Russell 2000 stocks poised to capture steady-state AI sector growth.\n\nLattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a prominent semiconductor company focusing on various “big data” computing solutions, including edge and cloud computing. Its core products also span across consumer electronics like televisions and laptops, ensuring its market penetration and staying power. Recent financials indicate strength for this often-overlooked semiconductor company and cheap Russell 2000 stock.\n\nIn April’s earnings report, Lattice boosted its financial standing slightly, which “Came in as expected [reflecting] the near-term impact of cyclic industry headwinds,” according to CEO Jim Anderson. Revenue dropped by 20% year-over-year, and the company adapted to cost-cutting initiatives while roughly maintaining its gross margin. Net income dropped, too, though the company still posted an 11-cent EPS. Despite the ambivalent news, shares dipped by about 4%, which seems reasonable considering the headwinds Anderson referenced.\n\nOne reason is a slight slowdown in demand. Enthusiasm for general-purpose artificial intelligence seems to have peaked, and consumers are cutting spending. This indicates that firms with an AI advantage have enough computing power to sustain them for the foreseeable future.\n\nSimultaneously, slowing consumer sentiment means Lattice’s peripheral products, like televisions, are not selling as expected. However, apparent shifts in consumer sentiment could reverse this trend. Lattice’s strong financial position allows it to withstand periods of flat sales growth, while its expansive portfolio ensures longevity in a competitive industry.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK) stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buy. Healthcare Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUnlike many of today’s cheat Russell 2000 stocks, Healthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) thrives in any interest rate environment. Furthermore, the company’s management is at the forefront of emerging healthcare trends, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking flexibility and responsiveness alongside the wider real estate sector’s upside potential.\n\nIn response to senior living facilities’ challenges during the pandemic, management decisively sold most of its senior housing assets for about $4 billion in 2020 and 2021. The company then strategically reinvested the proceeds into life science and medical office portfolios, sectors with high-quality assets in leading markets and top-tier tenants, both marking today’s top emerging healthcare segments.\n\nHealthpeak’s strategic repositioning allows it to capitalize on potential regulatory changes in healthcare, especially cost-management initiatives targeting aging populations on fixed incomes. With its high-quality facilities in niche markets, Healthpeak is well-positioned to meet the rising demand from premier healthcare systems, anticipating that those who can afford it will demand a more concierge experience.\n\nFirstCash Holdings (FCFS) An image of a laptop with money flying out of the screen\n\nFirstCash Holdings (NASDAQ:FCFS) thrives in a shrinking economy by offering pawn services nationally and globally. To that end, the company’s stock posted a decent 9% gain year-to-date, widely in line with wider markets. Anticipate another increase as we enter the summer season and consumers sell unwanted spring cleaning items for quick cash. FirstCash stands out among typical pawn shops by also providing a range of fintech-style financing and payment options, positioning itself as a pioneer in a world increasingly moving away from cash transactions.\n\nDespite high investment outflows, FirstCash consistently generates substantial free cash flow, totaling $355 million over the past 12 months. Its growth trajectory is stable, averaging 25% annual revenue growth and 27% annual net income expansion over the past three years. Between 2021 and 2022, net income more than doubled, and that momentum hasn’t yet abated. While initial gains could be partly due to reduced pawn interactions during the pandemic, economic tightening likely contributed to the increase. If this trend continues, the cheap Russell 2000 stock is set for similar gains as we enter 2024’s second half.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.",
        "content": "The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech.\n\nNo longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley.\n\nInstead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG,GOOGL).\n\n\"They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,\" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. \"And they're doing it for a reason.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference on March 21, as he announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The case was filed in New Jersey. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers.\n\nProsecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals.\n\nThe government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division.\n\nIt’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country.\n\n\"I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,\" Arteaga said.\n\nRoss is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.\n\nOutside of D.C. and a few other popular antitrust districts, Ross said, \"antitrust is like a hen's tooth — there are very few cases, and most average federal district judges have heard zero antitrust cases.\"\n\nD.C.'s dominance\n\nD.C. has long been the chosen spot for many of the most prominent antitrust cases in US history, including landmark cases against AT&T (T) and Microsoft in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nIts dominance extends back even further in time.\n\nSince 1899, the earliest year records are available, the DOJ filed 391 antitrust cases in the district.\n\nThat is nearly double the next closest counts of 222 filings in the Northern District of California and 220 in the Southern District of New York.\n\nStory continues Then-Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates at a June 2000 press conference in Redmond, Wash., to discuss the Justice Department's antitrust case against his company. (DAN LEVINE/AFP via Getty Images) (DAN LEVINE via Getty Images)\n\nIt held its dominance for most of the last decade as well. D.C. was home to the most new cases or tied for that title from 2015 through 2022.\n\nThat changed last year. In 2023, the government filed more antitrust cases in several places outside D.C., including states like Michigan and Oklahoma.\n\nWhen factoring in private antitrust suits, the district with the most combined competition suits last year — totaling 42 — was the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Federal district courts in New Jersey, Illinois, and New York followed.\n\nThe government's shift away from D.C. is happening at a time when there are rising concerns within the legal community about judge shopping in hopes of sympathetic rulings and state and federal governments intervening in private antitrust litigation.\n\nBills to disrupt judicial power in single-judge districts have been introduced in the Senate, and the Judicial Conference recommended changes to the case assignment process in March.\n\nChanging course\n\nThe Biden White House started its campaign against Big Tech close to home, in the D.C. District Court. That's where the FTC, under its Biden-nominated Chair Lina Khan, refiled an action against Facebook in 2021.\n\nThat case, first brought during former President Trump’s administration, alleged that the social media giant illegally blocked competition through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nIt also took over another case filed in D.C. by the prior administration, against Google, challenging the company’s online search dominance. A ruling from the judge in that case is expected soon.\n\nThen prosecutors changed course and veered away from D.C.\n\nIn December 2022, the FTC chose the US District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge Microsoft’s acquisition of video gaming giant Activision Blizzard. The effort failed, and the regulators appealed the matter to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nA month later, in January 2023, the DOJ, joined by eight state attorneys general, went after Google in a second antitrust case, this time in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Prosecutors alleged Google abused its monopoly in the digital advertising technology market.\n\nIn September of 2023, the FTC and 17 states sued Amazon in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The suit accused the retail giant of illegally monopolizing online marketplace services.\n\nThen this year in March, the DOJ and a group of state attorneys general sued Apple in the US District Court in New Jersey. The prosecutors claimed Apple illegally abused its dominance in the smartphone market.\n\n'Trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit'\n\nNew Jersey is a less logical place for the government to challenge Apple when compared to some of the other cases outside D.C.\n\nAmazon was targeted in the Washington district, where the company is headquartered, and Microsoft was sued in the Bay Area, where it has a significant physical footprint.\n\nBut Apple isn't domiciled in New Jersey nor does it have dominant operations there.\n\nOne factor that may help explain the government's choice is that appeals from New Jersey's federal trial courts are heard by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which in recent years has handed down decisions that could favor the government's claims against the iPhone maker.\n\n\"I think I think that the DOJ concluded that the case law was much more favorable for the Third Circuit as opposed to the Ninth Circuit,\" Arteaga said. Apple CEO Tim Cook in April. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAs for the case against Google in Virginia, the DOJ may be looking for a quick turn. The Eastern District court has earned its \"rocket docket\" nickname for the speed with which it handles litigation.\n\n\"I think there probably is an element of trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit,\" Ross said.\"Whether that's going to pay off for them or hurt them, I don't know.\"\n\nThe tactic, he said, could lead to more chaos in the law and increase the chances of getting one of the cases heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nKeith Harrison, also a partner in Crowell & Moring’s litigation practice, said bringing the cases against the country's most dominant and consumer-facing companies could prove valuable for the administration, win or lose, as it tries to communicate its agenda to a broader population.\n\n\"This [Apple] case is going to be a big case, wherever it's brought,\" Harrison said. \"But in New Jersey, it’s going to be the biggest case in that courthouse, and in local news on a regular basis.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Danial Azhar\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Meta Platforms has restored Facebook posts by Malaysian media covering Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's meeting this week with a Hamas leader, saying they were removed in error.\n\nThe removal had drawn complaints from Malaysia's government, a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause and which has warned that firm action could be taken against Meta and other social media companies if they were blocking pro-Palestinian content on their platforms.\n\nAnwar met Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas in Qatar on Monday. He later stressed that though he had good relations with the group's political leaders, he had no involvement in its military apparatus.\n\nMuslim-majority Malaysia had sent a letter asking Meta to explain the taking down of posts by two media organisations about the meeting, as well as the closure of a Facebook account last month belonging to a third outlet, the Malaysia Gazette, which covers Palestinian issues.\n\n\"Two posts were removed in error and have now been restored,\" a Meta spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.\n\nCommunications Minister Fahmi Fadzil, who is also the government's spokesperson, condemned the removal of the posts on Wednesday, accusing U.S. organisations of not respecting the freedom of media outlets.\n\nThe Malaysia Gazette said on Wednesday that its appeal to Facebook to reactivate the account had been accepted and is now operational again.\n\nMalaysia has long advocated a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nMeta has said it does not deliberately suppress voices on its Facebook platform, adding there was \"no truth\" to the claim it was restricting content supporting the Palestinians.\n\nMeta designates Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that governs Gaza, as a \"dangerous organisation\" and bans content praising the group. It also uses a mix of automated detection and human review to remove or label graphic visuals.\n\n(Reporting by Danial Azhar; Editing by John Mair and Edwina Gibbs)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "SNAP Stock’s Sizzling Q1 Results: A Tempting Treat or a Value Trap?",
        "content": "There’s a great deal to like about Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Specifically, the company’s first-quarter results indicate that it is finally starting to benefit significantly from rebounding U.S. advertising spending, and its user metrics were very strong in the first quarter. Moreover, Snap is well-positioned to benefit a great deal if TikTok does wind up getting banned in the U.S. Still, given the year-over-year declines of some of the firm’s profitability metrics, along with the high valuation of SNAP stock and the company’s past struggles, I recommend that investors sell the shares into their recent strength.\n\nImpressive Q1 Results and Potential TikTok Catalyst\n\nAs I noted in a May 8 column, analysts are raising their 2024 revenue estimates for the U.S. advertising market, and the sector is expanding quite rapidly. As I pointed out in the article, “research firm IPG Mediabrands last month raised its forecast for the U.S. ad market’s growth to 9.2% from its previous 8.4% estimate. “\n\nSnap is clearly benefiting from the sector’s strength as its revenue climbed 20% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $1.195 billion while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, came in at $46 million, up from $1 million in Q1 of 2023. Further, there were 85% more small-and-medium advertisers on Snapchat last quarter than in Q1 of 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd the firm reported several positive user metrics. For example, its daily active users increased 10% year-over-year (YOY) to 422 million and the number of subscribers to its Snapchat+ paid content service “more than tripled year-over-year” to over 9 million.\n\nMeanwhile, legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden will reportedly force TikTok to either sell its U.S. business or face a ban in America. Since TikTok is very popular among the young Americans that Snapchat targets, Snap’s social media offering is likely to get a huge boost if TikTok is banned.\n\nProfitability Declines and Past Poor Performance\n\nDespite the increase in Snap’s adjusted EBITDA, its operating cash flow actually fell to $88 million last quarter, versus $151 million in Q1 of 2023. Similarly, its free cash flow declined to $38 million from $103 million in the same period a year earlier.\n\nAnd the company’s cash outflows have undermined its balance sheet. Specifically, in March 2023, it had net cash of $250 million, while a year later it owed a net total of about $400 million. As Seeking Alpha columnist Michael Wiggins De Oliveira noted, the impairment of the firm’s balance sheet will undermine its ability to raise money and buy back its own shares going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso making me reluctant to recommend Snap is the fact that it has performed very well in the not-too-distant past, only to report horrible quarterly results soon afterwards.\n\nFor example, SNAP stock soared 89% in 2023, but in February 2024, the firm reported lower-than-expected Q4 revenue, triggering a huge decline by the shares. And after rising to $83 in September 2021 from $14 in June 2019, SNAP stock tumbled 81% in 2022.\n\nIn light of the name’s past volatility, I suggest waiting awhile before buying the shares to ensure that the company’s Q1 results are not just a positive blip.\n\nValuation and the Bottom Line on SNAP Stock\n\nAnnualizing Snap’s Q1 free cash flow of $38 million gets us to $152 million. Given the company’s market capitalization of $25.6 billion, the shares are changing hands for 168 times the company’s annualized free cash flow. That’s a stratospheric valuation.\n\nIn light of the company’s erratic performance in the past, the YOY declines of its cash flow last quarter, and the tough competition that it faces in the digital ad market from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)  and other large firms, that price is simply excessive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Last Call! 3 Growth Stocks Poised to Soar After Earnings Dip",
        "content": "This earnings season broke some investors’ hearts, even for the firms that actually reportedly have handsome top- and bottom-line beats. Indeed, quarterly earnings are much more than how the numbers stack up against analyst estimates. Though beating or missing the consensus is often enough to fuel a sizeable move in either direction for shares, full-year and the next quarter’s guidance also plays a big role.\n\nHeck, you could argue that the guide has played a bigger role in dictating the trajectory of stock over the past few weeks. Of course, one must also consider the impact of a stock’s valuation multiples going into a quarter. It’s too high a bar, and you could be looking at a rough reaction, regardless of how awesome the numbers came in.\n\nThis piece will look at three stocks I believe have great value after their post-earning stumbles. While the quarters have ranged from mildly disappointing to “just not enough to garner enthusiasm,” I view the following as worth watching, perhaps even nibbling at on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhether the post-earnings dip represents a timely “last call” ahead of closing time remains to be seen. There are no guarantees in the investment world, after all!\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) A black circle displaying a white EA logo is seen on top of black rectangular tiles.\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of the $33.8 billion video game juggernaut Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) fell under pressure last week as it stumbled past its quarterly earnings. Not only was EA’s fiscal fourth quarter unimpressive (earnings per share fell well short of expectations), but the fiscal 2025 guide came in a tad on the light side.\n\nInvestors punished EA stock accordingly, with shares now down close to 3% prior to its big reveal. It’s a modest plunge, but one that I believe is more than buyable or, at the very least, worth stashing on your radar. Though there was no sugar-coating Q4, I think the rough patch is forgivable, as there wasn’t a massive new title to drive sales for the quarter. Indeed, the mid-spring tends to be a rather seasonally weak period of EA, anyway.\n\nIts sports franchises (think Madden, EA Sports FC and NHL) tend to kick off with new releases in late summer and early autumn. In the meantime, EA must continue investing heavily in its growth pipeline and in new content to support its current slate of live-service titles. Though less timely, I view EA stock as an intriguing buy while it’s going for 27.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) shares stumbled after they reported last week. It was an ugly drop following first-quarter numbers that actually topped Wall Street estimates on the bottom line. In any case, investors didn’t forgive the decent showing as revenue guidance (now calling for 8-10% for the second quarter) came up just a bit short.\n\nStory continues\n\nABNB stock shed more than 6% in the following sessions before recovering modestly after that. Today, ABNB shares are off over 11% from 52-week highs and around 30% from its 2020 all-time highs. I’d argue that the latest correction is overdone for such a differentiated company that offers unique lodging experiences, especially given the more intriguing long-term roadmap.\n\nOver the long term, Airbnb will have plenty of room to expand internationally. Further, there’s room to evolve into a more “cross-vertical” company. At 19.9 times trailing P/E, ABNB stock may very well be a bargain right here.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have the great Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which nosedived on its April earnings only to regain most of the ground in May. Sure, the early bounce-back gains have already been made by investors who jumped in immediately after the number caused considerable selling activity. Still, META stock is a great AI play at below $470 per share.\n\nFurther, renewed fears over AI spending concerns may just drag shares lower again over the coming weeks should the dip-buyers grow exhausted. Either way, such big bets, I believe, make Meta stand out as a top-five, maybe even top-three AI stock to own for the next five years. Could such AI firepower make the current 26.9 times trailing P/E a tad too depressed? I believe so.\n\nThe only thing that may have investors on pause is the less-than-appealing technical picture. Indeed, it certainly looks like META stock is close to rolling over here. I wouldn’t hesitate to act on even lower prices if it does.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has wowed investors over the past few years with its triple-digit earnings growth and explosive share-price performance. And that's helped the company reach $2.26 trillion in market value. The reason behind all of the excitement? Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven their ability to power the most crucial of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks -- such as the training of large language models (LLMs) -- and the company now holds about 80% of the AI chip market.\n\nThis chip giant still has plenty of great days ahead, but two other AI stocks could join it in the $2 trillion club and even go on to surpass Nvidia's market value. These players have solid moats protecting their main businesses and have delivered strong earnings over time. Now their focus on AI could launch a whole new era of growth.\n\nWhile AI offers these players a boost in the coming years, increasing competition in the AI chip market may make it more difficult for Nvidia to grow as quickly as in recent times. Analysts expect annual growth of about 35% from Nvidia over the coming five years -- down from annual growth of more than 50% over the past five years.\n\nMy prediction is the following two AI growth stocks may be worth more than the chip giant in five years... Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in the two high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, with a solid moat thanks to its brand strength. And these businesses have helped the company generate billions of dollars in earnings annually.\n\nThough Amazon reported an annual loss in 2022 -- the first in nearly a decade as it struggled with rising inflation -- it quickly revamped its cost structure and delivered earnings growth a year later. Its efforts made Amazon more efficient and set the company on the right track for more growth down the road too.\n\nAmazon also should benefit from its investments in AI, particularly through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. AWS is the world's leading cloud-computing provider, putting it in the position to win as more and more companies launch AI projects. Everyone's talking about AI these days, but it's important to remember we're at the beginning of this story, so much of the growth is yet to come.\n\nAWS has prepared by offering customers all of the tools they need for their projects, from a wide range of chips for every budget to a fully managed service offering access to top LLMs.\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his recent letter to shareholders. AWS, historically Amazon's biggest profit driver, recently reached a $100 billion annual revenue-run rate and reported double-digit growth in sales and operating income in the recent quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Amazon's market value totals $1.94 trillion, but it could easily increase 16% to reach Nvidia's market capitalization -- and even surpass it -- as demand for AI projects gain momentum.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nYou may use Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) every day without even thinking about it. Meta is the owner of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of these apps daily. One reason Meta's moat is so strong is users know that if they leave Meta's social media for a rival platform, their contacts may not follow.\n\nAdvertisers understand this, so they flock to Meta with their marketing dollars, and this has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue annually for the technology company.\n\nIn recent times, Meta has put the focus on AI and has even said that its biggest investment area this year is in this high-growth technology. The company aims to launch AI across its apps, for example, by making an AI assistant available for every sort of use, from leisure to professional. Meta recently got the ball rolling by launching Meta AI, a conversational assistant in several English-speaking markets.\n\nThis should translate into revenue growth as users spend more time on Meta's apps, prompting advertisers to keep coming back and even increase their spending.\n\nMeta hasn't yet monetized its investment in AI, but the positive point here, as I mentioned above regarding Amazon, is that AI growth truly is in the early stages. That means AI could offer Meta a significant growth driver down the road.\n\nMeta today is worth $1.18 trillion, so it would have to gain about 90% to reach Nvidia's market value. That might seem like a lot, but Meta may have what it takes to make the leap. After all, over the past five years, the company's revenue and market value climbed 90% and 100%, respectively. So as the AI investment starts to bear fruit and boost earnings, Meta could replicate that performance -- and surpass Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Small Caps, Big Dreams: 7 Unstoppable Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve’s higher-for-longer interest rate policies are weighing on small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 index, which consists of the 2,000 smallest stocks on the market, is up just 1.6% in 2024. In comparison, the S&P 500, which is the 500 largest companies, is up nearly 10%.\n\nThat’s because high interest rates affect small businesses much more harshly than their larger counterparts. Small-cap access to financing becomes more expensive, consuming a larger percentage of scarce resources than it does for bigger businesses.\n\nLaboring under this regime even as inflation marches higher is a one-two punch to these companies. Yet some small-cap stocks are proving resilient. Below are seven small-cap stocks to buy that are proving unstoppable even though they fight with one hand tied behind their backs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCactus (WHD) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictions\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nOilfield services company Cactus (NYSE:WHD) is proving a prickly rival to its larger brethren Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and SLB (NYSE:SLB). The company sells pressure control equipment for wellheads as well as spoolable pipe and fittings, or flexible pipe that can be wound on a spool.\n\nAlthough Cactus is operating in a seasonally slow period for the oil and gas industry, the services firm was able to report stronger-than-expected revenue though earnings were slightly weaker in the first quarter. Yet Cactus spoolable technologies business was able to see better growth as larger customers bought more product. It anticipates the pressure control business will remain slow for the foreseeable future though it believes its latest product introductions could offset the slack.\n\nIndustry production, while weak now, has a long-term upward bias. Demand for fossil fuels continues to grow, which ensures oil and gas production will remain elevated and expand. Although the number of rigs in operation is down from the industry’s recent high in 2022, according to Baker Hughes, expect it to grow in the future and carry Cactus higher with it.\n\nBenchmark Electronics (BHE) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBenchmark Electronics (NYSE:BHE) is riding the semiconductor wave higher. Providing design and manufacturing services to a diverse customer base across semiconductors, aerospace, medical and more, Benchmark saw semiconductor capital equipment sales, its largest segment, jump 12% year over year to $165.9 million. Aerospace and defense, however, surged 33% to $105.8 million. Overall, though, Benchmark Electronics’ revenue was down 2.7% as medical, telecom and complex industrials saw sharp declines.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet this exceeded analyst expectations, as did adjusted earnings of 55 cents per share. Wall Street had forecast $645 million in sales and 46 cents in earnings. Benchmark Electronics stock is up 33% on the report as it delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of positive cash flow from operations and free cash flow (FCF), which stood at $43 million.\n\nAlthough BHE’s medical business was down this quarter, it secured new customers that should materially boost sales going forward. It was the same situation in the semiconductor space. While this year isn’t expected to be materially strong, Benchmark is looking for the money that flows from the CHIPS Act to trickle down to greater capital expenditures. The belief is this company could see some big wins in 2025 and beyond..\n\nColumbus McKinnon (CMCO) stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes D\n\nSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com\n\nColumbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) might not be a household name but it is the country’s largest manufacturer of hoists, cranes, actuators and other rigging tools. Despite a challenging market, the company has seen better-than-expected results even as it has faced higher one-off costs. It is due to report fourth-quarter earnings, which should confirm the business is expanding.\n\nColumbus McKinnon completed a state-of-the-art facility last quarter that expands its capacity and will lower costs over time. With about $1 billion in annual sales, the company is looking to double sales to $2 billion within five years.\n\nSome of that growth is tied to the electric vehicle (EV) industry, which might become a headwind if the market for EVs continues to slow. Still, record numbers of EVs are being built and the preference from buyers for hybrids should alter the overall growth trajectory of the business.\n\nColumbus McKinnon stock is up 13% year-to-date, outpacing the index and the overall stock market. As it also pays a modest dividend that yields 0.6% annually, CMCO stock may be a small-cap stock to buy in May.\n\nLand’s End (LE) The logo for Lands' End is displayed on a retail storefront.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetailer Land’s End (NASDAQ:LE) is on a tear. Its stock roared 67% higher after reporting earnings in March and the stock is up well over 120% since November 2023. The reason for the gains is Land’s End has a plan for profitability that is coming to fruition.\n\nGross profits in the fourth quarter grew 14% while margins improved 550 basis points allowing for a 31% improvement in adjusted EBITDA. For the full fiscal year, Land’s End reported a net loss of $131 million, or $4.09 per share. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was just $5 million, or 15 cents per share.\n\nBut 2024 is expected to be a turning point for the retailer. Management is looking for profits to appear with adjusted net income in a range of $3 million to $12 million, or 10 cents to 38 cents per share. That’s a pretty wide gap allowing for many different outcomes, but they all point to an improving picture for Land’s End.\n\nPubMatic (PUBM) The company sign is seen at the headquarters of PubMatic, an American digital advertising technology company for premium content creators.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloud-based programmatic ad tech platform PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM) is the next small-cap stock to buy because of an improved environment. We’ve seen the results from the likes of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Google and other large ad-reliant businesses witnesings a large influx of ad spending. PubMatic’s increased focus on digital delivery is boosting growth and causing customers to spend more with it.\n\nIn the first quarter PuMatic reported net dollar-based retention (NDBR) grew to 106% from 105% a year ago. That’s the amount of money existing customers spend with the company growing from one year to the next. During the quarter, omnichannel video sales, which includes connected TV (CTV), jumped 33% from last year.\n\nThat helped PubMatic swing from a year-ago loss of a penny per share to a profit of 9 cents this time around. With $174 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, coupled with no debt, the ad tech platform is a lean operation that should continue benefitting from the ongoing shift of advertising dollars to digital formats.\n\nSelect Medical Holdings (SEM) Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock. Healthcare Tech Stocks\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock\n\nPennsylvania-based healthcare stock Select Medical Holdings (NYSE:SEM) provides  long-term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, along with occupational health and physical therapy clinics. However, the occupational health business will be spun off by the end of the year into a new, separately traded company called Concentra.\n\nWhile details of the spinoff are not yet available, Concentra operates 544 occupational health centers and 150 onsite clinics at employer worksites in 42 states. Select Medical acquired the business in 2015 from Humana (NYSE:HUM) for just under $1.1 billion in partnership with private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe.\n\nSelect Medical’s acute care and rehab business, though, is growing strong and first-quarter results far exceeded even management’s expectations. Revenue was up 10% for the period generating a 51% increase in adjusted EBITDA. That should accelerate in future quarters after the separation as management can focus attention and resources on its core operations.\n\nUniversal (UVV) a pile of cigarettes\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUniversal (NYSE:UVV) is the world’s largest tobacco leaf supplier, operating in 30 countries around the globe. It supplies all three major U.S. cigarette makers but also China Tobacco International the world’s biggest cigarette maker.\n\nThat’s key because although the U.S. smoking rates are in a secular decline, only 5% of the world’s cigarettes are sold in the U.S. China is the largest market where 46% of the global supply is sold. China Tobacco controls 96% of the cigarette market there. So investors wondering whether there is a long-term growth story for Universal need only look outside the U.S. to see the tobacco market remains a viable industry.\n\nAn equally attractive reason for buying this small-cap stock is its dividend. Universal’s payout of $3.20 per share yields 5.9% annually. The tobacco trader has also increased the dividend for 50 consecutive years making it a Dividend King.\n\nBusiness remains robust with 92% of its leaf inventory already committed. Because it is a commodity supplies can fluctuate year-to-year and Universal warns the El Nino atmospheric effect could play a role in making supplies tight, its diversified global footprint should allow it to operate profitably without hindrance.\n\nUniversal also has a small food ingredients business that is growing, but it only accounts for about 12% of revenue. It could become a more meaningful segment over time, but expect tobacco leaf sales to be the main profit-maker for the company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 86%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are firmly in control on Wall Street. Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have respectively rallied by 19%, 36%, and 56%, as well as hit fresh all-time highs.\n\nWhile certain sectors and industries have played a role in pushing the broader market higher, the \"Magnificent Seven\" are attributed with putting the weight of Wall Street on their proverbial backs and lifting the stock market to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's view of the Magnificent Seven stocks is mixed\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from each of these businesses handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, they provide well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright moats within their respective industries.\n\nFor example, Alphabet's Google accounts for nearly 91% of worldwide internet search share, while Amazon's e-commerce marketplace oversaw close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are also the respective No.'s 1, 2, and 3 in cloud infrastructure service market share by enterprise spend.\n\nDespite the clear-cut catalysts the Magnificent Seven stocks bring to the table, not all Wall Street analysts share an optimistic view for their future. Based on bottom of the barrel price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three Magnificent Seven components could plunge by up to 86%.\n\nMeta Platforms: Implied downside of 24%\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven constituent that at least one analyst believes could meaningfully decline in the not-too-distant future is social media colossus Meta Platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski, who often takes a contrarian view on some of Wall Street's leading businesses, set a price target of just $360 on shares of Meta. This suggests 24% downside to come, based on the $476.20-per-share closing price, as of May 10.\n\nAccording to Slowinski, Meta lacks new revenue streams, when compared to the other companies spending big on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. This lack of new revenue channels, coupled with the company's forecast of higher capital expenditures tied to AI, have Slowinski believing Meta could underperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Meta is the undisputed leader among social media platforms. It owns the top social media \"real estate\" globally, including the most-visited social site (Facebook), and lured 3.24 billion users to its family of apps on a daily basis during the quarter ended in March. Businesses understand they're not going to reach a broader set of eyeballs on any other social media platform, which tends to afford Meta exceptionally strong ad pricing power.\n\nMeta Platforms also benefits from lengthy periods of economic expansion. Since it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, the company would be vulnerable to a recession. At the moment, a few key indicators, including a historic drop in U.S. M2 money supply, do suggest an economic downturn is probable.\n\nHowever, recessions are short-lived. All 12 U.S. recessions since 1945 have endured between two and 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth last for multiple years, and occasionally even stick around for a decade. Ad-driven businesses thrive during these long-winded expansions.\n\nA final reason Slowinski may be forced to eat his words is Meta's balance sheet. The company closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated north of $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations through the first three months of 2024. In other words, it has the capital to take risks and aggressively invest in its future -- even if the payoff from those investments are a few years away from being truly material to its top and bottom line. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 31%\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that one Wall Street analyst views as anything but \"magnificent\" is semiconductor behemoth Nvidia.\n\nBased on a February note issued by analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, there's concern about demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerating graphics processing units (GPUs) peaking in the current year. With the prospect of slower growth on the horizon, Luria's low-water price target of $620 implies a decline of 31% for Nvidia's stock over the coming year.\n\nOn the bright side, Nvidia's GPUs have come to dominate AI-accelerated data centers. With demand handily outpacing supply, strong pricing power helped to more than triple Data Center segment sales in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28).\n\nBut Luria hit the nail on the head when it comes to competition. While most folks might be focused on external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are both rolling out AI-accelerators for enterprise data centers, it's internal competition from Nvidia's top customers that's the far bigger concern.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four-largest customers and comprise in the neighborhood of 40% of its net sales. But these four giants are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if this is purely for complementary purposes, demand for Nvidia's high-powered chips would likely wane after the current fiscal year.\n\nWhat's more, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation over the last three decades that didn't navigate its way through a bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors overestimate the uptake or adoption of new technologies. Since no company has benefited more from the rise of AI, Nvidia would, in theory, be hit the hardest if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nLuria's price target on Nvidia is likely to be reached.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 86%\n\nBut the disaster du jour among Magnificent Seven stocks, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street pundit, is electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla. Gordon Johnson, the CEO and founder of GLJ Research and longtime Tesla bear, believes shares will reach $23.53.\n\nThis weirdly specific price target was arrived at by applying a multiple of 15 times Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) in 2025 and working backwards using a 9% discount rate. Keep in mind this price target was issued earlier this year, and Tesla's consensus EPS for 2025 has declined since then. If Johnson's price target were to prove accurate, shares of Tesla would implode by 86% from where they closed on May 10.\n\nTesla has made a habit of proving skeptics wrong. For instance, it's the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit. Tesla recently introduced its fifth mass-production model (Cybertruck) and has the capacity to roll out more than 2 million EVs annually.\n\nHowever, headwinds are most definitely mounting for North America's leading EV company.\n\nAs an example, increasing EV and hybrid competition has coerced Tesla to slash the sales price of its primary production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. CEO Elon Musk has been clear that his company's price strategy is entirely based on demand. But even with these aggressive cuts, Tesla's inventory levels have soared and its operating margins are tumbling.\n\nTesla's efforts to transform into more than just a car company haven't gone swimmingly, either. Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has slowed dramatically, while Services segment gross margin is consistently in the low-to-mid single digits. Meanwhile, more than half of the company's pre-tax income during the March-ended quarter came from unsustainable sources (e.g., interest income and the sale of regulatory tax credits).\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that Musk has proved to be a tangible liability for the company. Many of Musk's promises, such as Level 5 autonomy and robotaxis, which are already baked into Tesla's valuation, have failed to come to fruition. The longer these claims go unfulfilled, the likelier it is that Tesla's massive valuation premium to other auto stocks will deflate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "VRT, DELL, PLD: Which AI-Flavored Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "The technology-driven market rally will eventually run out of steam. However, until it does, many analysts are optimistic about overlooked companies that could gain just as much as the most obvious high-growth stocks. Though the implied upside varies greatly in the following trio (VRT, DELL, PLD), I would keep tabs on the following stocks as analysts look to reward companies that are able to make money from AI bets sooner rather than in the distant future.\n\nIndeed, getting in on the AI boom entails a great deal of investment. And it’s about time that such bets had a clearer payoff. With rates likely to stay elevated for another year, we’ll need to see some of those “strategic” AI-related investments translate into cash flows. Therefore, in this piece, we’ll check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool below to check in with three AI-flavored plays that retain their Strong Buy ratings from the analyst community.\n\nVertiv (NYSE:VRT)\n\nShares of data center infrastructure and services provider Vertiv will not be for the faint of heart after skyrocketing more than 670% since its April 2023 lows. Undoubtedly, the stock seems just too hot to handle, but, in many ways, the company’s story seems to “rhyme” with that of the AI chip makers. More demand for AI applications means more AI chips are needed. And more AI chips mean more up-to-speed data center demand.\n\nGiven said tailwinds, I’d be bullish had it not been for the hefty multiple—90.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) at writing—and the profound momentum behind the stock. For now, I’m sitting on the sidelines with a neutral position, but I would be tempted to jump into VRT stock on a steep pullback.\n\nGiven booming AI-led infrastructure demand, and the more palatable forward P/E of 40.8 times, VRT shareholders may have enough reason to justify sticking by the name. Add the recently-raised full-year guidance for sales and adjusted operating profit into the equation, and it certainly seems like Vertiv’s a winner poised to continue winning. Citigroup (NYSE:C) analyst Andrew Kaplowitz certainly seems to think so, with his Street-high price target of $110.00, implying over 11% upside from here.\n\nOf course, the stakes remain high, especially if investors call for heavy spenders on AI to pull back ever so slightly. If there’s one thing we learned this quarterly earnings season, it’s that AI innovation costs money, lots of money. And perhaps investors want balance rather than sheer aggression on spending (I’m looking at you, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)).\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for VRT Stock?\n\nVertiv stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average VRT stock price target of $97.00 implies 1.75% downside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL)\n\nThe longtime personal computer (PC) and server firm Dell Technologies has shown us that it can compete in the AI revolution. The stock caught many by shock as it added to last year’s gains with a notable quarterly beat that helped contribute to the massive 73% year-to-date surge in shares. Even after its historic rally, I’m more inclined to stay bullish on the stock, as it’s clearly an AI play that’s been slept on by far too many market participants.\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest upside surprise is already in, with numerous analysts already having re-evaluated the firm to the upside for its AI server prowess. Like Vertiv, Dell is an AI hardware player that’s starting to feel the heat of the AI boom. And the good news is that there may still be many more quarters that could feel the lift of AI server demand. Further, unlike some of the AI software developers, it seems like the hardware players are ready to profit from the boom in a span measured in quarters rather than years.\n\nDell isn’t just focused on feeding AI server demand with the hottest new GPUs; it also stands out to win as it readies its newest PC slate for a potential on-device AI supercycle. Of course, demand for personal AI hardware could extend for many years.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of DELL Stock?\n\nDell stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average DELL stock price target of $122.25 implies 8.9% downside potential.\n\nPrologis (NYSE:PLD)\n\nNext, we have Prologis, a logistics real estate investment trust (REIT) that has been betting on data centers. PLD stock has been stuck in a multi-year rut since imploding back in 2022. Now down more than 36% from its all-time high, thanks to the headwind of higher interest rates and softening demand for warehouse space, I think now seems like an opportune time to go against the grain.\n\nShares sport a bountiful 3.6% yield, which is pretty good for a “growthy” REIT that will live to see better days, likely when consumers are in a healthy enough spot to spend more on e-commerce platforms. All things considered, I am bullish despite warehouse headwinds that may stick around for many quarters to come.\n\nEven in the face of industry challenges, Prologis is ready to keep investing in its high-growth future. Earlier this year, the firm announced its intention to bet $25 billion on data centers. That’s a big deal that punches Prologis’ ticket to the AI bandwagon. Warehouses are out, and data centers are in. As warehouse demand continues to drag, the REIT will diversify into a timelier arena that could help reverse its stock trend well before the demand picks up.\n\nIn these early stages of the AI boom, the world needs more data centers. Though expensive, I see Prologis’ big bet on the data center as having the potential to pay massive dividends.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of PLD Stock?\n\nPrologis stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average PLD stock price target of $132.07 implies 22% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are some less-obvious companies that stand to profit big from the AI revolution. As investors insist on seeing AI bets turn into dollar bills, I expect the following trio of data center plays could gain more love on Wall Street. Of the trio, investors expect the most from PLD stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Metaverse was once thought to be the next iteration of the internet. However, after billions of dollars of investments from tech companies, the Metaverse has yet to live to its full potential. Still, the largest tech companies in the world continue to invest in the Metaverse in hardware and software. It’s surprising how advanced the technology has become in just a few short years. As investors, the best investments are made in the early, undercover ideas that others may not fully understand. Here are three Metaverse stocks to buy for those interested in the opportunity and possibility of the Metaverse.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a no-brainer as one of the top Metaverse stocks to buy after changing its name from Facebook to Meta in 2021. As of May 2024, Meta is the seventh-largest company in the world by market cap and one of only seven companies worth more than $1 trillion. How does Wall Street feel about Meta? In April, 53 of 62 analyst recommendations were a Buy or Strong Buy rating. Additionally, its average price target of $516.13 is nearly $40 higher than its current price of $476.20.\n\nSince 2020, the Reality Labs department at Meta has lost over $45 billion. While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that spending will decline on the Metaverse, Reality Labs will continue to operate. Products like the Oculus AR/VR goggles and brand new Rayban Meta Smart Glasses have demonstrated their commitment to the Metaverse. Meta also sees an opportunity to expand to enterprise solutions and collaboration tools.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter gaining 37.5% in 2024, Meta’s stock remains cheap on a price multiple basis. Shares trade at just 8.8x sales and 24.1x forward earnings while maintaining an impressive 32% revenue CAGR over the past ten years. Even beyond its Metaverse potential, Meta is a company that is firing on all cylinders and shareholders can count on being richly rewarded.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a name that needs no introduction. It is the second-largest company in the world, next to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Of the 38 analyst recommendations received in May, the stock has 32 Buy or Strong Buy ratings. The average analyst price target of $202.36 also represents a strong 10% upside from the current price.\n\nWith the launch of its VisionPro Headset earlier this year, Apple jumped headfirst into AR/VR. VisionPro only adds to Apple’s strong hardware base, with more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide as of February 2024. With the headset on, users can operate most applications from the Apple ecosystem in real-time virtual reality. From messaging to streaming videos to Facetiming friends worldwide, VisionPro gives a small taste of Apple’s long-term plans in the Metaverse.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple stock is trading at a relatively reasonable 7.4x sales and 27.9x forward earnings. After dipping its toe into the Metaverse and recently committing to building data center chips for AI, investors should look to Apple as a company that may be on the cusp of its next big growth story.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) Is Autodesk Stock Still A Buy At New Highs? 3 Pros, 3 Cons\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a tech company that builds software platforms for architecture and design. Analysts remain bullish on the stock despite ADSK returning a loss of about 7.0% this year. As a testament to this, the average analyst price target of $287 represents about 30% upside from its current price and the street-high price target of $320 is nearly 50% higher.\n\nThis company utilizes the Metaverse as a way for users to design and model buildings in virtual reality. Using the Metaverse, Autodesk allows for greater remote collaboration and a more precise simulation. In this way, Autodesk is one company that uses Metaverse to improve efficiencies and productivity for the users of its software platforms.\n\nDue to its underperformance this year, Autodesk is trading at more attractive and depressed multiples. With shares trading at just 8.5x sales, its P/S ratio is nearly the lowest it has ever been in the past five years. While Autodesk doesn’t get the coverage that Meta and Apple get, you can bet on it as a well-run software company that will only continue maintaining its 16% five-year revenue CAGR.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here Are My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is still a dominant trend in the stock market, but not every AI stock is worth buying. Now that the initial rush into these companies is over, you have to take a close look at them to see if they're worth buying, as some are grossly overvalued.\n\nThree AI stocks with bright prospects that don't carry an unreal premium are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These three represent some of the top AI companies available to investors. If you're looking to increase your exposure to AI, they are a great starting point.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nNone of today's AI technology would be possible without Taiwan Semiconductor. While there are other semiconductor manufacturers, few can compete with the scale and technology Taiwan Semiconductor offers.\n\nNvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple devices utilize Taiwan Semiconductor-produced (not designed) chips. Taiwan Semiconductor is a contract chip manufacturer, which means it takes designs from its clients and then produces them. With cutting-edge technology like 3-nanometer (nm) chips available, TSMC is one of the top players in this realm.\n\nIt's also starting to see an AI business boom. In its first-quarter conference call, management called demand for AI-related products \"insatiable.\" Management also forecasts AI revenue to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and make up 20% of its overall revenue by 2028. Furthermore, management's overall goal is to grow revenue between a CAGR of 15% and 20% over the next couple of years. This is massive news and gives investors a great reason to buy and hold the stock for the long term.\n\nAs for pricing, Taiwan Semiconductor can be purchased for around 23 times forward earnings. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile this isn't cheap, it's a fair price considering that the S&P 500 trades for 20.7 times forward earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor should grow at a healthy pace over the next few years. With the stock at a fair price, it's a great AI stock to buy now.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is likely better known by its platforms under its umbrella: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The primary source of revenue for these apps (and the whole company, for that matter) is ads. In Q1, 97.8% of revenue came from ads, so Meta must be at the top of its game to maintain its current business stature.\n\nTo improve its ads, Meta has utilized AI to pinpoint which ads are best suited to the viewer, creating better conversion rates. It's also introducing generative AI tools to step up its game further. With these tools, advertisers can create a base ad, and then the generative AI tool can change the background, adjust the image to better fit the device it's being viewed on, and vary the text to highlight things a particular viewer values more than another.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta also has other technologies it's attempting to develop that use AI and that could be profitable down the road, but if those come to life, it will just be a bonus.\n\nMeta's current business is thriving, with revenue rising 27% and earnings per share (EPS) increasing 114% in Q1. At 24 times forward earnings, the stock is a no-brainer buy.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet has some similarities to Meta Platforms, as advertising makes up 77% of revenue, thanks to its Google search engine and YouTube. It's also developing generative AI tools for advertisers.\n\nOne use is for clients that utilize Performance Max, a tool that analyzes an ad and has a set of requirements to ensure the campaign's performance has \"good to excellent ad strength.\" With Alphabet's generative AI platform, Gemini, integrated into this product, advertisers can instantly generate text that fulfills all of the tool's requirements, saving time and resources.\n\nAlphabet also has its Google Cloud cloud computing offering. This platform is one of the best for anyone looking to create AI models, and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth more than $1 billion) are clients of Google Cloud. This segment posted one of its best quarters ever, with revenue rising 28% and delivering an operating margin of 9%.\n\nAt 22.5 times earnings, Alphabet is the cheapest stock in this group. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nI think Alphabet is a great AI stock pick, as the tools it is creating are helping advertisers become more efficient and successful. With other areas of its business succeeding, too, it's a fantastic AI stock pick.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia. ©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters (©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters)\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gains last year, but can they repeat those extraordinary returns this time around?\n\nProfits for the \"Mag 7\" are forecast to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500’s 2.4% anticipated year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nThis group of mega-cap tech companies — Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2023, Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting for some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500.\n\nHere’s how the mega caps performed this first quarter and what Nvidia is expected to deliver when it reports next week.\n\nTesla (TSLA) — reported 23 April\n\nTesla reported a 9% drop in first-quarter revenue, the biggest decline since 2012, and missed analysts’ estimates, as the electric vehicle company weathers the effect of ongoing price cuts.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) maker said it had made $1.13bn (£910m) over the first three months of the year, compared with $2.51bn a year earlier.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that the company plans to start production of new models in “early 2025, if not late this year,” after previously expecting to begin in the second half of 2025.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Anglo American, GameStop, Vodafone, Greggs and Novavax\n\n“We slightly raised our 2024 deliveries forecast, versus our prior forecast for no growth. Our improved outlook is due to Tesla’s recent price cuts, so we also slightly reduced our near-term automotive gross margin forecast. We think Tesla could cut prices further as management aims to pass along the majority of cost savings to customers to drive demand,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) — reported 24 April\n\nMeta beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines with its first quarter earning but a disappointing Q2 forecast gave investors the chills.\n\nTotal revenue rose 27% to $36.5bn and Meta forecast a slight improvement in the current March-June quarter. The Facebook owner reported earnings per share of $4.71 in the quarter.\n\nHowever, looking ahead, Meta says it will see second quarter revenue between $36.5bn and $39bn, falling short of midpoint estimates of $38.24bn.\n\nMeta said it had raised the high end of its full-year capital expenditure guidance from $37bn to $40bn in order to “continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap”. It added that it expected capital expenditures to “continue to increase next year”.\n\nRead more: Meta, Apple are investing in tech that can decode your thoughts\n\nMeta stock has had a strong performance, climbing 131% over the last 12 months and more than 39% year to date.\n\nHowever, it lost $132bn in market cap after its earnings, and several analysts lowered their target prices following the report. It is the only Mag 7 constituent that has failed to impress markets.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) — reported 25 April\n\nMicrosoft’s heavy bet on AI appears to be paying off as the world’s largest public company reported $61.86bn revenue for the last quarter.\n\nTotal revenue increased 17% to $61.86bn during the first three months of 2024, the third quarter of its financial year, surpassing analyst expectations of some $60.88bn. Earnings per share increased 20% to $2.94, ahead of the expected $2.83.\n\n\"Microsoft’s AI-powered earnings demonstrate that doubling down on innovation is paying off,\" Jeremy Goldman, senior director of briefings at Emarketer, told Reuters, pointing to the company's early moves in generative AI, such as its large investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nRead more: Microsoft to invest €4bn in French cloud and AI services\n\nSales in Microsoft’s cloud division, its biggest revenue driver that includes its Azure computing platform, climbed 21% during the quarter to $26.7bn, compared with analysts’ forecasts for $26.2bn and above company guidance.\n\n“Wide-moat Microsoft continues to deliver with strong third-quarter results, topping both our top- and bottom-line estimates. Results are impressive from most angles, but we highlight strength in AI, Azure, and gaming; a surge in bookings from large Azure deals; and robust margin performance despite downward pressure from the Activision acquisition are our key takeaways,” said Dan Romanoff, equity research analyst at Morningstar.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) — reported 25 April\n\nAlphabet’s first-quarter revenue jumped 15% as Google’s parent company announced its first-ever dividend of 20 cents a share alongside a $70bn (£56bn) stock buyback.\n\nGoogle posted $80.5bn in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and reported $1.89 in earnings per share, up from $1.17 – beating analysts’ expectations on both counts.\n\nThe company also announced its first dividend, of $0.20 per share, and said the payout would become quarterly.\n\n“Our leadership in AI [artificial intelligence] research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release.\n\nRead more: Google-backed Anthropic releases Claude chatbot across Europe\n\n“Alphabet is taking a tougher stance on costs than its AI rival, continuing to cut headcount and consolidating teams to blunt the impact of infrastructure investments on profitability. Meanwhile, search advertising increased 14%, YouTube advertising surged 21%, and the cloud business also delivered impressive growth, with revenue up 28%, the best result in more than a year,” according to Michael Hodel at Morningstar.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — reported 30 April\n\nAmazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter, driven by growth in advertising and cloud computing.\n\nThe earnings sent shares of the retail giant up as much as 5% in pre-market trading.\n\nAmazon posted profits of $10.4bn (£8.3bn) in the first three months of 2024, up from $3.2bn during the same period last year.\n\nFirst-quarter sales increased 13% to $143.3bn, driven by strong retail sales in North America and rapid growth across Amazon Web Services (AWS), its digital infrastructure division. Net income more than tripled to $10.4bn in the first quarter.\n\nSales at AWS accelerated 17% in the first quarter to $25bn, topping Wall Street’s forecast for sales growth of 12% to $24.5bn.\n\nThe company expects revenue of $144bn to $149bn for the current quarter ending June.\n\nRead more: Amazon to invest $1.3bn in France, create 3,000 jobs\n\nCEO Andy Jassy told analysts that for Amazon \"there is a big opportunity in front of us\" in servicing AI customers.\n\nAmazon has been expanding its physical footprint in Europe and has just made a commitment to invest €1.2bn in France, which will go toward creating more than 3,000 jobs and increasing the company’s footprint in the country.\n\nFrance has also secured investment from Microsoft, with the mega cap committing €4bn toward expanding its cloud and AI infrastructure in France, in addition to funding AI skilling and support for France’s technology industry. It is pursuing a similar strategy in the UK.\n\nMamta Valechha, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Amazon is a much-loved name with expectations increasing into results given strong performances from other cloud names such as Microsoft and Google. But nevertheless, we have a company producing record profits and using these profits to fund the next leg of growth.\"\n\nAmazon saw its stock surge 81% in 2023 and is betting that generative AI will produce tens of billions in revenue for Amazon Web Services in the next few years.\n\nAmazon aims to be a dominant player in the market despite being slow to invest in this technology.\n\nApple (AAPL) — reported on 2 May\n\nApple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped estimates and announced an expanded stock buyback programme.\n\nApple fell behind in the AI race and while rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Meta spend billions of dollars to support AI infrastructure the iPhone maker is only now making a push.\n\nThe company is reportedly nearing a deal with OpenAI for ChatGPT to power new AI features on the iPhone. Rival Microsoft is one of OpenAi's biggest sponsors.\n\nApple is also said to be in discussions with Google and Anthropic, maker of the Claude AI chatbot, to improve features such as Siri and search.\n\nApple is also reportedly building its own AI chip for data centres, the vast facilities that power chatbots using remote computer servers.\n\nRead more: Apple set to sell Vision Pro headset outside US\n\nThe iPhone maker reported revenue of $90.75bn ($72.22bn) in the first three months of 2024, down 4% from the year before but slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $90.3bn.\n\nSales of its flagship iPhone were down 10% from the year before to $46bn, compared with $51.3bn the previous year, and sales in China fell to $16.3bn for the quarter, against $17.8bn a year ago.<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?p=GOOG&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOG</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL?p=GOOGL&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOGL</a>), Meta (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META?p=META&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">META</a>), and Microsoft (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">MSFT</a>) have pulled ahead, while others, like Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL\\\">AAPL</a>), have faced mounting challenges.</p>\\n<p>Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives joins The Morning Brief<em> </em>to discuss what he calls \\\"the fourth industrial revolution\\\" in AI and Apple's advances on the front.</p>\\n<p>Ives states that Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference will be paramount for Apple: \\\"I think it's probably the most important event for Apple that we've seen potentially in a decade because this is going to be [CEO Tim] Cook laying out the AI strategy on the services side for developers, what I believe is really the start of an AI app store in terms of how that's going to morph and then its proprietary AI technology in iPhone 16, which will launch in September.\\\"</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:6;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dow-winning-streak-novavax-surges-112547962.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.</p>\\n<p><em>This post was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:7;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/nicholas-jacobino/\\\"><em>Nicholas Jacobino</em></a>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l49M3KSGAJH7T5fNatD2gA--~B/aD0yOTA4O3c9NTE3MzthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/20266780-0ed7-11ef-bff1-511fcaffd304\",\"duration\":\"PT3M52S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/2791272b-63eb-347b-b11f-b19395ba142e.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-catching-ai-revolution-dan-142925403.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"2791272b-63eb-347b-b11f-b19395ba142e\"}\n\nApple reported net income of $23.64bn, or $1.53 per share, down 2% from $24.16bn, or $1.52 per share, in the year-earlier period.\n\nCEO Tim Cook attempted to reassure investors about the state of the business in the world's second largest economy, noting that iPhone sales were actually up in mainland China.\n\n\"I maintain a great view of China in the long term,\" he said.\n\nThe company also announced another $110bn in share buybacks and raised its quarterly dividend by 4%.\n\n“We project 6% compound annual revenue growth for Apple through fiscal 2028. The iPhone will be the greatest contributor to revenue over our forecast, and we project 3% growth for iPhone revenue over the next five years. We expect this to be driven primarily by unit sales growth, with modest pricing increases,” said William Kerwin, analyst at Morningstar.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) — reporting on 22 May\n\nThe AI boom of these tech mega-caps would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia — the last of the Mag 7 to report — can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nNvidia is anticipated to report earnings of $5.49 per share for the current quarter, marking an increase of 403.7% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe earnings are projected to be $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05bn for the entire fiscal year, according to TradingView.\n\nRead more: Nvidia rivals gold as shield against inflation, survey shows\n\nNvidia shares took a hit earlier this week when the investor Stanley Druckenmiller said that he'd slashed his big bet in the chipmaker earlier this year. He said the swift AI boom could be overdone in the short run.\n\nStill, Nvidia is leading the race in the AI \"gold rush\" and a survey revealed that the stock is rivalling gold (GC=F) as a possible hedge against inflation.\n\nGold is still seen as the best safeguard against the risk of rising prices, according to 46% of survey participants. But nearly a third said the tech mega caps are their first pick for the role.\n\nWatch: 'Magnificent 7' should remain strong in 2024 - CIO\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Facebook Use May Have Helped Trump With Some Voters, Report Says",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Using Facebook in the lead-up to the US 2020 presidential election might have increased the chances of someone voting for Donald Trump, university researchers said in a study published Monday in the academic journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind GameStop Shares Soar as ‘Roaring Kitty’ Revitalizes Retail Frenzy Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk’s Cuts China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe\n\nAs part of the study, the researchers asked nearly 19,900 Facebook and 15,600 Instagram users to stop using the platforms ahead of the 2020 election. The authors, led by Stanford University professors Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow, found some evidence suggesting that people who used Facebook might have been more likely to vote for Trump. They noted that their finding fell “just short” of being statistically significant.\n\n“So we need to take it with a grain of salt,” Gentzkow said in a statement. “But if it’s real, it’s big enough that it could impact the outcome of a close election.”\n\nThe report represents the largest-scale evidence to date on the role of Facebook and Instagram access in shaping political opinions and knowledge ahead of a presidential election. It’s part of a broader research effort aimed at studying the impact of social media on democracy. Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. agreed to give researchers from Stanford University, New York University and other academic institutions access to platform data and algorithms to conduct the work.\n\nThe researchers were careful to point out in the latest study that the findings were specific to the users studied, but they said the results are consistent with the general opinion that Trump’s campaign more effectively used Facebook than the Biden campaign did. The report comes as Biden and Trump are set to face off yet again in a November election. Social media companies including Meta, X and TikTok are fielding increasing pressure to moderate content on their platforms in the lead-up to the vote.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed to a part of the study that found deactivating your social media account didn’t have a significant effect on the perceived legitimacy of the 2020 election. Researchers noted that “these null results are important in light of the prominent challenges to election legitimacy that took place around the 2020 election, including Trump’s emphasis on potential fraud in the run-up to the election and the ‘Stop the Steal’ movement that followed it.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: RFK Jr. Sues Meta, Says Presidential Campaign Video Censored\n\nThe study published in PNAS found that using Facebook and Instagram had little to no effect on a person’s political leanings, their views of whether the election was legitimate, their opinions of opposing parties, or whether they voted. But using Facebook may have made people more likely to vote for Donald Trump, the researchers said. Instagram use didn’t result in the same effect on vote choice, the report shows.\n\nThe researchers warned in the study that their their findings on vote choice can’t be “extrapolated to the broader population without strong assumptions.”\n\nThe results worked to affirm previous studies published last year that, among other things, found that changing the sorting and types of stories that users saw in their news feeds and limiting re-sharing of posts didn’t change political attitudes. Despite that, Facebook has long been criticized for its perceived influence over elections. The social media site came under fire during the 2016 election for selling ads to Russian actors trying to sow discord among US voters and during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, which was organized in part on the platform.\n\nTrump used Facebook extensively during his last two presidential campaigns, amassing more than 34 million followers on his official Facebook page before being banned from the site in 2021. After losing the 2020 US Presidential election, Trump began posting false claims about election-rigging on Facebook, which the company determined encouraged the Jan 6. insurrection.\n\n(Updates with Meta response in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges ‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "Social networks have changed consumer behavior since their introduction. Advertisers flock to these platforms for targeted ad placements and higher conversion rates than most advertising channels.\n\nThese platforms benefit from winning people’s attention and have gotten very good at it. Many consumers habitually visit their favorite social networks through smartphone apps, desktops and other means.\n\nSome social media stocks have delivered exceptional returns for their investors. Even though these platforms have been around for a while, shareholders can stand to benefit from these three social media stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leading advertising giant. Thanks to YouTube, it has a monopoly in the search engine market and a strong position in the social media industry.\n\nYouTube is the most senior of video-focused social networks. The platform was founded in 2005 and has roughly 2.50 billion monthly active users. Alphabet is also growing in the cloud computing industry. Google Cloud’s growth rate outpaced the company’s advertising growth in Q1 2024.\n\nOverall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year in the quarter. Net income jumped by 57% year-over-year and helped the corporation achieve a 29.4% net profit margin. Alphabet has been a steady outperformer. It’s logged a 22% year-to-date gain and has nearly tripled over the past five years.\n\nAnalysts are feeling optimistic about the tech giant. It’s currently rated as a “Strong Buy” among 38 analysts and has a projected 13% upside. The highest price target of $225 per share suggests a 33% upside.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFacebook is arguably the most recognizable social network on the web. This foundational piece of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) was founded in 2004. Since its humble beginnings, Meta Platforms has amassed 3.24 billion daily active users across its platforms. That figure is from the company’s Q1 2024 earnings results.\n\nDaily active users increased by 7% year-over-year, but that’s not the only metric that went up. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year, while net income surged by 117% year-over-year. The social media firm is becoming more efficient and reporting top-line growth while trimming its headcount by 10% year-over-year.\n\nCost-cutting measures have helped the company initiate a dividend program that will give a quarterly payout of $0.50 per share. Meta Platforms has a low yield for now, but investors should anticipate a double-digit growth rate for several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts aren’t waiting for the yield to get higher. The stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” among 43 analysts. Meta Platforms has a projected 11% upside from current levels.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) has returned to the spotlight as younger consumers flock to the platform. Shares are up 95% over the past year and have gained 16% year-to-date. The image-focused social network impressed investors with 23% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter 2024. Net losses decreased by 88%, going from $209 million in Q1 2023 to $25 million in Q1 2024.\n\nRevenue in North America, Europe and the rest of the world increased by more than 20% year-over-year. Monthly active users grew by 12% year-over-year to reach 518 million. The company exhibited strong growth in Europe and the rest of the world. Monthly active users in the United States and Canada inched 3% higher year-over-year.\n\nPinterest grew its average revenue per user by 10% year-over-year, with strong gains in North America. While North America didn’t experience as much user growth, Pinterest is getting its money’s worth from each user.\n\nThe stock is rated as a “Moderate Buy” among 30 analysts. The latest price targets have been quite bullish, with the highest price target of $52 per share suggesting a 24% upside.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG.

        "content": "By Stephanie Kelly\n\nNEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Independent U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr and a super PAC supporting him filed a lawsuit on Monday against Facebook parent Meta Platforms, alleging the tech giant interfered in the election after it blocked a political advertisement.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco by Kennedy and the American Values 2024 super PAC, which paid for the advertisement, a 30-minute video about Kennedy's life, says Meta censored the video by removing it and blocking users on its platforms from watching, sharing or posting a link to it.\n\nMeta owns the Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms.\n\nThe lawsuit said Meta began censoring the May 3 video \"within minutes\" and cited a statement from Meta on May 5 that said the video was no longer being censored. The lawsuit claims the film is still being blocked for users.\n\n\"Defendants seem to believe that they can with legal impunity issue threats to their users and deploy their vast power of censorship, account-suspension, and deplatforming in order to favor or target the presidential candidate of their choice,\" the lawsuit stated.\n\nMeta declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nA Meta spokesperson in a statement last week said: \"The link was mistakenly blocked and was quickly restored once the issue was discovered.\"\n\nAfter the ad was blocked, Kennedy and scores of others took to social media to criticize what they said was an injustice. Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of social media platform X, reposted the video on X, saying it was \"worth watching.\"\n\nThe video, called \"Who Is Bobby Kennedy\" and narrated by actor Woody Harrelson, is a 30-minute dive into Kennedy's life, famed family, and the media's \"crank\" perception of him. It highlights Kennedy's background as an environmental lawyer, and his fear of a \"rushed\" coronavirus vaccine along with skepticism around the effectiveness of pandemic-era lockdowns.\n\nKennedy, who has been banned in the past from Alphabet Inc's YouTube and Meta's Instagram for spreading misinformation about vaccines, as well as about the COVID-19 pandemic, rejects the anti-vaccine label, saying vaccines should have more rigorous testing.\n\nA post from Kennedy on Facebook in which he shares the video has about 10,000 \"likes.\" The same post on social media platform X has about 84,000 \"likes.\"\n\nKennedy, who is challenging Republican former President Donald Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden for the White House in November, could pick up 8% of voters nationwide, a Reuters/Ipsos poll in March showed.

        "title": "Monopoly Definition and 12 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will go over the definition of a monopoly and take a look at the 12 near-monopoly stocks in the US. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nA monopoly is characterized by a single seller holding sway over a market, offering a singular product. In its truest sense, a monopoly commands a 100% market share. Many sectors are governed by key players with substantial market dominance. These companies benefit from economies of scale and erect barriers to entry, thwarting potential newcomers from challenging their dominance. In our previous examination of near-monopoly stocks, we referenced Warren Buffett's 2011 testimony before the US Congress, in which he highlighted pricing power as a crucial factor in assessing a business. Buffett, one of the most renowned investors globally, has amassed billions through his publicly traded holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). With an impressive investment history and personal wealth, Buffett has sought out consumer monopolies whose products possess unique qualities such as patents, brand names, or other intangibles that effectively deter competition.\n\nIt's worth noting that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) holds the largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, valued at over $174.34 billion as of Q4 2023. The tech giant's dominance extends to several industries, either through outright monopoly or near-monopoly positions. Additionally, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks as the third-largest investment in Warren Buffett's portfolio. Headquartered in New York, the company offers credit and debit card services, alongside Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).\n\nOverall, the financial media has been abuzz with discussions about the significant portion of the stock market surge in 2023 attributed to only seven companies, nicknamed the \"Magnificent 7.\" These select companies represent over 30% of the total value of the S&P 500, despite making up just 1.6% of the index, and contributed over 60% to the overall market gain in 2023. Excluding them, the stock market's increase last year would have been a modest 9% after adjusting for inflation. When examining profits, it's evident why. According to Deutsche Bank macro strategist Jim Reid, the Magnificent 7 generates approximately $361 billion annually. This amount is comparable to the combined profits of all companies in Japan and notably surpasses the total profits of all listed companies in the UK, which roughly amount to $217 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn theory, a monopoly might not seem problematic, but by definition, it could harm consumers if not closely regulated. Without competition, monopolies may charge excessive prices, offer subpar products, and limit choices to maximize their profits. While not outright banned by law, various regulations exist to ensure monopolies engage in fair practices. The Sherman Antitrust Act, for example, is a key legislation used to break up companies that stifle competition and prevent mergers that could create virtual monopolies. Another example comes in the form of lawsuits, whereby which governments aim to prevent anticompetitive practices in a market. The most recent one involved the US Department of Justice and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Earlier in March, the Justice Department, alongside over a dozen state attorneys general, lodged a lawsuit in the US District Court in New Jersey targeting the tech behemoth. Alleging anticompetitive behavior in the smartphone market, this move signifies another step in the Biden Administration's campaign to rein in the influence of Big Tech, and follows previous antitrust actions directed at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHowever, despite these regulations potentially limiting profits, investors often find monopolistic stocks attractive. The significant market share held by monopolies can contribute to long-term growth and value, offsetting some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have solidified their position by dominating a sector and securing a significant market share are often considered among the best near monopoly stocks in their respective industries. Monopoly Definition and 12 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US\n\nNorthfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we've pinpointed 12 US stocks that demonstrate near-monopoly characteristics, largely driven by their significant market share. Many of these companies belong to the FAANG cohort, comprising major players in the technology sphere. These tech giants dominate various sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile applications, operating systems, search engines, social media, and web browsers. Additionally, other stocks in our selection command near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors like alcoholic beverages, personal credit rating, and satellite radio.

(NYSE:MO) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our second example of a high-yielding security is the stock of Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO). Before we get into the details of why we started a position in Altria, a brief history is in order. The company was formerly known as Philip Morris before rebranding to Altria in 2003. Cynically, the rebranding was to minimize the negative attention from its tobacco business. However, the company also owned Kraft Foods and Miller Brewing, so it was logical to reflect its status as a conglomerate. Since rebranding, Altria has slowly “de-conglomerated”. It spun out Kraft in 2007. It spun out Philip Morris International in 2008. In 2021, it sold its Ste. Michelle Wine Estates business. Finally, last month Altria announced it is selling part of its 10% ownership in Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)\n\nAndvari has followed Altria since we began our investment career. Profitability is extraordinary and the business requires minimal capital expenditures. Despite the volume of cigarettes having steadily declined—a great thing for our population health—Altria has still managed to grow revenues and profits with regular price increases…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n8.

Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO): FICO is a leader in predictive analytics and decision management software and is also the provider of FICO credit scores.

        "title": "AMD Failed To Meet Lofty Expectations",
        "content": "AMD Failed To Meet Lofty Expectations\n\nAt the end of April, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) failed to impress, unlike Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) that has been crushing investor expectations on the back of soaring AI chip sales for quite a while. It’s no secret that AMD trails the undoubtable leader Nvidia that holds as much as 80% of the thriving market for AI server semiconductors.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the March quarter, AMD reported revenue rose 2% YoY to $5.47 billion that slightly surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $5.46 billion.\n\nUnlike last year’s comparable quarter when it made a net loss of $139 million, or 9 cents per share, AMD reported a net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share.\n\nAdjusted earnings amounted to 62 cents per share, slightly surpassing 61 cents a share analysts expected.\n\nData center revenue jumped 80% to $2.3 billion thanks to AMD's MI300 series of AI processors that challenge Nvidia and its graphics processing units. CEO Lisa Su revealed that AMD’s MI300X is being used by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL). Since the launch which took place during 2023’s fourth quarter, AMD sold over $1 billion worth of chips.\n\nBut it was not enough to offset weakness in the traditional server market. Moreover, AMD’s results were also hurt by gaming revenue that tanked as much as 48% to $922 million.\n\nAMD already guided significant double-digit percentage declines in this segment due to revenue from the chips it designs for gaming consoles such as Xbox from Microsoft Corporation and PlayStation 5 from Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) already hitting their peak. This year marks the fifth year since the most recent generation of gaming consoles has been released and AMD's videogame console revenue peaks after roughly four years.Moreover, a report from research firm Newzoo that was published in April revealed that gamers are clocking in less hours. Newzoo expects personal computing and console gaming revenue growth to continue lagging pre-pandemic levels through 2026. Year to date, industry giants like Sony and Electronic Arts have laid off hundreds of employees. Sony Group is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. All eyes will be on the profitability of the gaming division as PlayStation 5 promotions ate into profits during the third quarter. When it reported its third fiscal quarter results, Sony lowered projections of PlayStation 5 sales and gaming revenue for the rest of the fiscal 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue from the embedded segment that consists of networking chips also plummeted 46% to $846 million, with demand for the segment already expected to remain soft throughout the first half of the year. Revenue was additionally hit from ongoing inventory corrections from this segment as clients clear out a build-up of chips.\n\nA Guidance That Failed To Impress\n\nFor the full year, AMD expects AI chip sales of about $4 billion, raising its prior estimate by $500 million. As for the second quarter, AMD guided revenue of about $5.70 billion, plus or minus $300 million which is in line with LSEG’s average estimate.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, AMD guided for second quarter’s gross margin of about 53%, hardly beating the estimate of 52.9%.\n\nIn simple words, investors were expecting a stronger demand pipeline for AMD’s AI-related products and were disappointed were AMD being slower than Nvidia.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Meta Stock Continues To Fall: Is The Era Of AI Gains Coming To An End?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been grappling with declining investor confidence despite delivering better-than-expected financials for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Shares of META have declined by nearly 7% over the past month.\n\nThe decline comes amid a flurry of activities to expand the company's operations as CEO Mark Zuckerberg focuses on an ambitious push into artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse.\n\nChanging Key Areas of Focus\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the founder of Meta Platforms, kicked off the company’s recent earnings call by emphasizing the importance of artificial intelligence. However, despite his enthusiasm for future prospects, investors seemed skeptical.\n\nThe stock experienced a significant drop of up to 19% in extended trading on April 24, wiping out over $200 billion in market capitalization. This decline occurred despite Meta reporting better-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter.\n\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" Zuckerberg stated during the earnings call.\n\nZuckerberg highlighted future monetization strategies, including the integration of ads or paid content into AI interactions. He also discussed opportunities for expansion in the mixed-reality headset market, emphasizing the potential for AI integration in devices like AR glasses.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg remains optimistic about the long-term potential of AI products, he cautioned investors about the multiyear investment cycle required for these ventures to become profitable services.\n\nDespite the company’s efforts to innovate, Meta’s Reality Labs unit, responsible for developing the metaverse, continues to incur substantial losses. With sales of $440 million for the quarter and losses totaling $3.85 billion, the division’s cumulative losses since 2020 exceed $45 billion.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.\n\nDecelerating Growth\n\nMeta’s financial performance for the first quarter exceeded expectations, with earnings per share of $4.71 and revenue of $36.46 billion, surpassing Wall Street estimates of $4.32 and $36.16 billion, respectively. However, a light revenue forecast for the second quarter overshadowed these results, contributing to the stock sell-off.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta announced its projected sales for the second quarter, which are estimated to range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of this forecast, at $37.75 billion, reflects an 18% year-over-year growth. However, this figure falls short of analysts’ average expectation of $38.3 billion.\n\nThe company is currently focusing on developing emerging technologies like glasses and mixed reality, which currently do not yield profits. Meta also disclosed that capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to range between $35 billion and $40 billion, marking an upward revision from the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\nA More Stable Growth Prospect\n\nInstitutional investors have recently discovered a new strategy to hedge against market volatility and enhance portfolio stability – home equity investments (HEIs). HEIs allow investors to gain exposure to residential real estate by purchasing a portion of a homeowner’s equity in their property. In exchange for a lump sum payment, investors receive a share of the future appreciation of the home’s value.\n\nAccording to Morningstar DBRS Senior Vice President Derek Moran, “Interest in this market is high and can be expected to continue growing, especially if interest rates remain high, and homeowner equity stays strong.”\n\nHEIs offer compelling benefits for investors, including:\n\nDiversification: HEIs provide exposure to the residential real estate market, helping to diversify portfolios heavily allocated to stocks and bonds.\n\nAttractive returns: HEIs have the potential to generate strong returns, particularly in an environment of rising home prices. Originators often secure HEIs at a discount to market value, providing immediate upside potential.\n\nDownside protection: HEI contracts typically include protective provisions that mitigate losses in the event of declining property values.\n\nUncorrelated returns: HEI performance is primarily driven by home price appreciation rather than interest rates or stock market fluctuations.\n\nNow, with the emergence of innovative platforms like Cityfunds, retail investors can access this institutional-grade asset class with as little as $500. Cityfunds allows you to invest in the equity of carefully selected properties in prime locations, targeting potential appreciation while mitigating risk.\n\nInvestors can choose to invest in specific cities through Cityfunds’ offerings, such as Miami, Austin and Los Angeles, gaining exposure to some of the strongest real estate markets in the country. These Cityfunds have demonstrated impressive appreciation, with shares of the Miami Cityfund up 14.7% already and up 10.9% for the Austin Cityfund.\n\nYou can easily get started by signing up on the Cityfunds website and choosing which cities you want to invest in.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta CEO.

If you wish to skip our analysis of digital education and demand for TEFL courses, please proceed to The 5 Best Online TEFL Courses to Get You Teaching ASAP.\n\nDigital Education\n\nThere has been a significant boom in the digital education market over the past few years. As of 2023, Global Newswire reports that the digital education market stood at a valuation of $19.2 billion. However, the industry is expected to snowball towards a size of $95.7 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 25.8%. The reason the industry saw a significant boost in 2020 was due to lock-down restrictions all over the world. The UN revealed that nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries were adversely affected due to the coronavirus-related restrictions. As the pandemic continued to linger on, people turned to online courses in an effort to improve their skills, stay busy, or transition towards alternative incomes.\n\nSimilarly, business organizations began enrolling their employees in online courses as an alternative to conventional training seminars. Thus, online education became a vital tool for major organizations to motivate staff and increase their efficiency as remote employees. Just weeks into the pandemic, online education platforms began reporting significant surges in enrollment and completion of online courses. On 30th April 2020, Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY) reported a 425% increase in enrollments on its platforms, along with an 80% increase in usage from businesses and governments.\n\n“The trends we’ve seen over the last two months represent a significant acceleration in the transformation to a new Future of Work.”\n\n- Darren Shimkus, Former President, Udemy for Business, Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY)\n\nIncreased enrollments fueled the recognition of online courses and certifications around the globe. In its 2021 Impact Report, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) revealed it had achieved over 200% growth in enrollment of entry-level professional certificates. Some of the entry-level certifications offered by Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) were developed in partnership with Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM), enabling individuals with limited educational backgrounds to develop the competencies necessary to work in the biggest organizations on the planet.\n\nPost-pandemic, digital education is expected to continue spearheading innovation in the education sector. One notable segment in this market is that of English language learning. According to Research and Markets, the global market for English Language Learning was estimated at $21.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a size of $70.7 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 16.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTEFL Courses\n\nApart from other benefits such as ease of communication and improved learning capabilities, English language courses can be a gateway for new career opportunities. TEFL, or Teach English as a Foreign Language, is one such credential that can help open new doors. TEFL is an internationally recognized certification that certifies an individual’s competency to teach English to non-native speakers.\n\nDemand for TEFL courses can be gauged by the fact that many notable digital education companies and edtech organizations have introduced the certification on their platforms in the last few years. In April 2023, edX, a leading global online learning platform from 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU) partnered to launch a new TEFL professional certificate program for edX users. Our article on Best Online Degree Programs For Working Adults highlights how 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU) is one of the most significant names in the EdTech industry.\n\n\"We look forward to providing edX learners with the ability to gain a valuable certification with The TEFL Org and to go on and create a positive impact in the lives of those they teach.\"\n\n-Andrew Hermalyn, President, Degree Support, 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ: TWOU)\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about what is the most accredited TEFL course, join us as we look at the best online TEFL courses to get you teaching ASAP.

        "title": "Nvidia Was Key to Success in My Stock-Picking Derby",
        "content": "You had to pick Nvidia.\n\nTo do well in my latest annual stock-picking contest, Dorfman's Three-Stock Derby, it helped immensely if Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of your selections. Six people chose it as one of their three picks, and each of them finished among the top 10 contestants.\n\nHarriet Ruben, a retired real estate broker from Fairlawn, Ohio, won the latest contest with an 88.7% return. She scored a 144% gain in Nvidia, 96% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and 26% in Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). All figures are total returns including dividends.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nThese are popular, large-capitalization growth stocks, which are the type of stocks that Ruben favors in her actual investing. She says she has a large portfolio, which includes each of her three contest entries, plus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and quite a few other stocks.\n\nRuben says she listens to corporate chief executives who are interviewed on television, then follows up with statistical research on her broker's web site. I look for the next best thing,' she says.\n\nBeaten down\n\nUsing quite a different approach, Ted Dempsey of Virginia Beach, Virginia, grabbed second place in the Derby. He is 87 years old, a retired Navy officer and consultant. No longer an active investor, he liked to speculate on stocks that are beaten down in price.\n\nFor his contest entries last May, he chose Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) and PacWest Bancorp, which was acquired by Banc of California Inc. (NYSE:BANC). His average return on the three was 76%.\n\nDempsey says he was able to retire mostly because of a big gain on his investment in Labor Ready Inc., now known as TrueBlue Inc. (NYSE:TBI), an industrial staffing company. I happened to know the two founders of Labor Ready, he says. I was probably excessive in buying it but I got very lucky.\n\nBitcoin surge\n\nRobert B.K. Krout of Virginia Beach finished third with a 75.8% return. His return came on the strength of a 298% surge in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:EBTC); his other two picks declined.\n\nKrout is a retired mechanical engineer and a volunteer with the Sierra Club Offshore Wind Group. He believes bitcoin prices tend to follow a pattern: a low period for a year or so before demand and price rise again.\n\nIronically, crypto currencies play only a small role in Krout's real-life investing. He owns some bitcoin and some ethereum, but regards them as speculative and limits his crypto exposure to about 2% of his total portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nHis other two contest picks for 2023-24 were Albemarle corp. (NYSE:ALB) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). He continues to like them, and also likes a number of big technology names.\n\nWide spread\n\nThis year there was a huge dispersion of contestants' results. Of the 34 people who entered, nine had returns of 50% or better, while 11 had losses. The worst loss was 39%.\n\nThe median return for contestants was 20%. That was close to the return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index, which was 20.2%.\n\nYou can play\n\nYou are welcome to enter the next edition of Dorfman's Three-Stock Derby, which will be the 17th such contest I have hosted.

Or mail it to John Dorfman, Dorfman Value Investments, 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110.\n\nEntries must be postmarked or time stamped by midnight May 31, 2024. The contest period will be from the market close on that date through the close on April 30, 2025.\n\nIf you finish in the top three, I will want to interview you on short notice and possibly on a weekend, so the phone numbers are vital.\n\nYou do not need to own the stocks you select, but it is fine if you do.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share, indicating a change of +44.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.10 points to a change of +35.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.12 indicates a change of +15% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for META _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $38.14 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +19.2%. The $158.94 billion and $179.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.8% and +13.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nMeta Platforms' estimated fair value is US$559 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$476 share price, Meta Platforms appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Our fair value estimate is 7.4% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$520\n\nDoes the May share price for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$45.7b US$52.2b US$58.9b US$66.7b US$72.5b US$76.9b US$80.8b US$84.2b US$87.3b US$90.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x19 Analyst x19 Analyst x9 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Est @ 6.11% Est @ 4.99% Est @ 4.21% Est @ 3.66% Est @ 3.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$42.6k US$45.4k US$47.8k US$50.4k US$51.1k US$50.6k US$49.5k US$48.1k US$46.5k US$44.8k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$477b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$90b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.4%) = US$1.9t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.9t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$941b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$1.4t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$476, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.058. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Meta Platforms, we've put together three relevant items you should further examine:\n\nRisks: Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Meta Platforms  you should know about.

        "content": "Neurotechnology using artificial intelligence is opening up new possibilities in healthcare that previously didn’t exist.\n\nFor decades companies and researchers have been exploring implantable devices that interpret signals in the brain and translate them into words or physical commands. The technology is not new, but now, artificial intelligence is accelerating advances, allowing people affected by debilitating diseases to communicate in ways that were physically impossible before.\n\nThese devices have been game changers for people like Rodney, a patient living with ALS who had a Stentrode device implanted in his brain. The device, which was developed by Synchron, a neurotech company backed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Microsoft’s Bill Gates, contains a tiny electrode that converts brain signals into physical actions, allowing Rodney to type on a keyboard using only his thoughts.\n\nWhile neurotechnology can be empowering for patients like Rodney, AI could make less invasive neurotech more accessible for everyday consumers and spur the next generation of consumer-facing tech products.\n\nAccording to Precedence Research, the market for neurotech devices was valued at around $15 billion in 2023, and it's projected to reach over $55 billion by 2032. That's a major reason why Big Tech companies like Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) are backing research into devices that can decode thoughts and perceptions without requiring invasive surgery.\n\nBut as Big Tech moves ahead to build off neurotech advancements in the medical world, experts have cautioned that it could put our most valuable data — the privacy of our thoughts — at risk.\n\n“This is our final fortress of privacy, and we've given up every other aspect of privacy that exists,” said Nita Farahany, a futurist, tech ethicist, and author of “The Battle for Your Brain.”\n\nBig Tech wants to read your mind\n\nElon Musk’s Neuralink made headlines early this year when the company implanted its first human patient with a brain-computer interface (BCI), though the company said on Thursday it encountered some issues with the implant.\n\nThe Neuralink implant, which has over 1,000 electrodes and 64 threads, experienced a malfunction after a number of threads retracted from the brain, which decreased the number of effective electrodes. In a blog post, the company said this would not negatively impact how the implant works.\n\nMusk is not the only CEO trying to make neurotechnology a reality. At least 30 companies are currently selling neurotechnology or developing the technology.

(Apu Gomes/Getty Images) (Apu Gomes via Getty Images)\n\nApple, for instance, has a patent for AirPods with EEG technology embedded to measure brain activity. Given concerns over Apple’s sluggish iPhone sales, some investors are hoping the company will turn out exciting new products that will drive additional revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nHealthcare has long been a goal for Apple. CEO Tim Cook laid out this strategy in 2019, saying, “If you zoom out into the future ... and you ask the question, what was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind, it will be about health.”\n\nMeta is another company funding a team of neuroscientists who are pushing this research further to understand how humans process language.\n\nIn one study conducted by Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group, researchers flashed an image in front of participants for 1.5 seconds. Users seated in a neuroimaging machine thought of the image they saw, and AI was able to use that brain activity data to recreate the image.\n\n\"At the moment, this is not a mind-reading technology,\" Jean-Rémi King, the lead neuroscientist working on the project, told Yahoo Finance. \"What we can try to do is reconstruct the image that they see at the given moment, so we really decode perception.\"\n\nThe results weren’t perfect, as seen in the image below, but they were close enough that the research team initially thought the test was flawed. On the left is the photo Meta's Fundamental AI Research team showed participants. The image on the right shows the image that AI reconstructed by decoding participants' brain activity.\n\n“The first reaction was … let's try to find where we could have had some bugs that could explain the quality of these results,” King said.\n\nKing stressed that consumer-facing products are not the end goal of his research, and Meta says its aim is to “help people who have suffered traumatic brain injury to communicate.”\n\nBut at the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made the company's neurotechnology ambitions clear since 2021, when he began touting an armband that uses electromyography to detect neural signals, allowing users to type and click on a screen with the subtlest of hand movements.\n\n\"I think we’ll start getting some consumer neural interfaces soon,\" Zuckerberg said in April. \"I’m not talking about something that jacks into your brain. I’m talking about something that you wear on your wrist.\"\n\nThe privacy problem\n\nThere's a big question underlying all this research and product development: What does our world look like if Big Tech companies can literally read your mind?\n\nNoninvasive brain-monitoring devices can be revolutionary in medicine for patients, but not everyone is thrilled by the prospect of Big Tech having access to peoples' thoughts.\n\nNeurorights advocates believe our thoughts are the last piece of data we have left to ourselves. That’s why they are now fighting for legislation that would safeguard mental privacy while tech companies continue funding brain-scanning research.\n\n\"There's absolutely no regulation,\" said Dr. Rafael Yuste, a professor of biological sciences and neuroscience at Columbia University. \"It's like the Wild West.\" On July 6, 2024, electroencephalography (EEG), which measures the electrical activity of the brain, will celebrate its 100th anniversary. (Jacob Schröter/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nAfter years of research, Yuste discovered a way to control the thoughts of mice using lasers. The experiment scared him so much that he co-founded the Neurorights Foundation in an effort to safeguard thought privacy.\n\nAnd already, concerns about the privacy implications of neurotechnology are driving policy change. In April, Colorado passed a bill that expanded the state’s privacy act to include neural rights — the first of its kind in the US. Similar legislation is also on the table in states such as California and Minnesota.\n\n“The one space we have for mental reprieve is really our brains and mental states,\" Farahany said. \"It's the kind of final piece of the puzzle.”\n\nFarahany has a proposed framework for neurorights legislation that argues for more privacy overall, with “a right to self-determination over our brain and mental experiences.”\n\nAccording to Farahany, it would still allow patients who want — and even need — neurotech to have access to it.\n\nFor Rodney's part, when I asked him via WhatsApp what he hopes his Stentrode device will accomplish long term, he thought back: “Hopefully, it will get to more people.”\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 10 AI Stocks. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nEarlier this month, billionaire Ken Fisher, while talking to Bloomberg, said that in his career spanning 50 years he never spent a \"moment\" thinking or worrying about what the central banks \"might do.\"\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher Says He Doesn't Waste a \"Moment\" Worrying About Fed Moves\n\nWhy? Because Fisher said he's \"always believed\" that \"they are just about as crazy and out of their minds as you can be.\"\n\nFisher, 73, said that the central bank management \"never\" knows what to do as it's reactive. To drive this point home, Fisher reminded everyone that just a month before the Fed's first 75bps rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that he was not even \"thinking about\" raising rates by 75bps.\n\nFisher Says Some Threats and \"Big Surprises\" are Not Priced In\n\nKen Fisher has been bullish on the economy over the past several months. Rate hikes, the inflation storm, banking crisis and global uncertainty did not waver Fisher's belief that we will come out of this crisis unscathed. But in his latest interview Fisher voiced concerns about some of the threats he believes are not yet \"priced in.\" Fisher is worried about \"big surprises\" that can impact global stocks and global GDP. Fisher said in financial markets everyone is usually worried about more or less the same things. But sometimes threats can slip through the cracks and we don’t see them coming. Ken Fisher said a classic example of this surprise is mark-to-market accounting rules implemented in 2007 which \"hugely took the mortgage problem and amplified it to write $2 trillion off of global bank balance sheets.\"\n\nHowever, Fisher reiterated that he's bullish on the market right now.\n\n\"But whenever I am bullish I am still looking for risks.\"\n\nFisher Is Worried About a Nuclear War in Asia\n\nFisher's worries about the geopolitical chessboard stem from what he called the nuclear-armed triangle: China, India and Pakistan. Fisher said these three nations have different economies, politics and culture and they \"usually don’t like each other.\" While Fisher thinks the odds of war in the region are not high, he doesn’t think such a war is \"impossible\" and fears any conflict between the nuclear powers in Asia would be \"catastrophic.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKen Fisher's Favorite Sectors\n\nWhen asked about what sectors he's looking as bargains, Fisher said he wouldn’t call them \"bargains\" because \"valuations don’t usually tell you much about short to intermediate term stock price direction.\"\n\nInstead, Fisher is looking for sectors that would do \"pretty well\" in a moderate growth economy with a \"slowly decelerating inflation\" environment.\"\n\nFisher likes energy and high-end consumer luxury goods sectors. He also said that while healthcare hasn’t been in a market-leading position, he expects \"big healthcare\" stocks to start becoming \"better and better.\" Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher\n\nBubble or Not? \"It's The Garbage That Tells You\"\n\nAsked whether he believes the tech stock rally of 2024 is a bubble, Fisher talked about a \"telltale\" sign that we can use to find out whether we are in a bubble or not. Fisher said that when \"garbage\", low-quality IPOs start to flood the market, you should start worrying about a bubble. Fisher said high-quality company stocks making new highs, backed by revenue and profit growth, is not what you call a bubble.  Fisher highlighted that after the \"SPAC world of 2021,\" 2023 saw the lowest volume IPO market since 1984.\n\n\"And that tells you we are not anywhere close to an actual bubble.\"\n\nFisher Investments Likes Q1 Earnings\n\nFisher Investments in a latest posted talked about how positive Q1 earnings were and said the latest numbers show the market returns were broadening out and the firm's bullish outlook was confirmed.\n\n\"With 427 companies having reported as we write, the blended earnings growth rate is 5.5% y/y.This figure, for those who don’t have their financial jargon glossary handy, blends actual results for the 427 reporting firms with estimates for the remaining dozens. So while the stragglers could pull the headline rate down some, it seems safe enough to say earnings grew for the third straight quarter. Growth was broad-based, too, with 8 of 11 sectors growing and only Materials, Energy and Health Care in the red. Communication Services led the charge at 35.8% y/y, driven by whopping 70.2% growth in its Interactive Media and Services industry. Pair this with Tech’s 22.7% y/y and Consumer Discretionary’s 24.0%—led by e-commerce—and it seems clear to us the Tech and Tech-like firms leading the charge during this bull market are doing so for concrete reasons, not just AI hype and other associated faddish chatter. Yet the more value-oriented Industrials (6.7% y/y) and Financials (7.2%) also did well, underscoring the bull market’s underappreciated breadth.\"\n\nFor this article we scanned Fisher Investments' Q1'2024 portfolio and picked its biggest AI-related holdings. With each stock we have mentioned Fisher's stake.  Why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $2,742,649,339\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is using AI to increase engagement on its platforms. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently talked about its AI-spending plans:\n\n\"We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 billion to $99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We’re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\n9. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $2,873,725,266\n\nBroadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the best AI stocks to buy according to Ken Fisher. Citi in a recent note reiterated its Buy rating on Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) along with some other semiconductor stocks as the firm is bullish on the industry amid the rise in sales in March.\n\n\"This data, together with recent commentary from the analog companies, support our view of an analog inventory replenishment in 2H24, and we remain bullish on the group,\" Citi analyst Christopher Danely said.\n\nCarillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) traded higher after closing on its acquisition of VMware. The company also announced earnings that were relatively in line with estimates with some benefit of better operating expenses. The stock appears to be one of the first real beneficiaries of generative artificial intelligence (AI) with meaningful revenue expected to show up in 2024.”\n\n8. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $3,007,951,821\n\nNetherlands-based ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top semiconductor stocks to own for the AI revolution since ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) supplies ultraviolet lithography photolithography machines used to manufacture  advanced 3nm and 5nm chips. Jim Kelleher of Argus has set a  $1,000 price target on the stock.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\n7. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $3,265,146,393\n\nKen Fisher owns a $3.2 billion stake in Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) as of the end of the first quarter of 2024. UBS recently published a list of stocks that would be the leaders in the \"Enabling Tech\" space by 2030. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is part of the list. When it comes to AI, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is being considered as a pick-and-shovel name that would allow businesses to actually implement AI in their operations as Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) offers AI-powered CRMsolutions.\n\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the world’s leading SaaS vendor for customer relationship management (CRM) and salesforce automation (SFA) software. Free cash flow for FY2024 came in significantly better than expected, and Salesforce guided free cash flow growth to again be very strong in FY2025. The company also pointed to several things with the potential to accelerate future growth including pricing, artificial intelligence, and a better buying environment.”\n\n6. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $3,946,548,478\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is in the spotlight after the company posted a whopping 60% jump in April revenue on a YoY basis. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one of the leaders in the AI space, powering AI chips as it supplies semiconductors to major companies like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) recently said it plans to begin producing A16 chips by 2026. This would be a new technology in the semiconductor manufacturing space which, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) believes, would be welcomed by companies that require AI-focused chips. A16 chips feature nanosheet transistors that supply power to chips from the bottom up.\n\nAriel Global Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We purchased manufacturer and marketer of integrated circuits, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). TSMC has a dominant share of the global foundry market and is an industry leader in terms of scale, technology, customer service and execution. Although demand for smartphones and PCs is stabilizing, we expect the company to benefit from the secular growth trends of Artificial Intelligence (AI) longer-term. A downturn in the foundry industry this year presented us with an attractive entry point, as we think the current forward price-to-earnings ratio does not fully reflect the high-quality nature of the business model.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Analysts Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024 Insiders are Buying These 10 Best-Performing Stocks in 2024\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "title": "Better Than Truth Social? 3 Social Media Stocks to Buy Instead.",
        "content": "Social media stocks will continue to attract attention because of two critical factors: the 2024 election cycle and this year’s $251 billion market opportunity.\n\nI take every forecast with a pinch of salt — however, an estimated 7.30% annual growth rate in total revenue (CAGR 2022-2027) is anticipated, translating into a projected market volume of $190 billion by 2027.\n\nTo take advantage of the market size, we will explore three social media stocks to buy trading below their 52-week highs with “buy” ratings. Let’s explore!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) someone using the Facebook (FB stock) app on their phone in front of a laptop that also has the Facebook webpage on it\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is up 37% in 2024, but analysts remain bullish. 43 analysts support a “Strong Buy” consensus rating, with 39 recommending a “Buy.” The stock’s price target averages approximately $531, which represents an almost 12% upside potential from its list price of around $475.\n\nLlama 3-powered Meta AI illustrates how ongoing innovation boosts the upside. Its flexibility allows the clever AI tool to serve users on Meta’s platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, in English in over a dozen countries.\n\nMeta is also letting third-party developers and hardware specialists use its Meta Quest operating system to make mixed-reality apps more accessible.\n\nWhat’s more, in the lead-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, Meta has detailed its policies to secure polls on various platforms and avoid any costly legal battles. This includes a big fact-checking network, strict ad constraints, significant security investment and new guidelines that require advertisers to disclose if they employ AI for social or political advertising\n\nFinally, Meta’s last earnings report showed strong beats on the top and bottom lines. Annual first-quarter revenue rose 27% to $36.46 billion, and net income of $12.37 billion was more than twice the year before, but the price plunged 10% after the results on weak guidance, opening an attractive entry point for investors looking for social media stocks to buy.\n\nBumble (BMBL) The logo for Bumble (BMBL) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nBumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) is undergoing a transformation. Lidiane Jones is now CEO of Bumble, complimenting a number of new hires, such as David Ard as Chief People Officer, Ali Rayl as Chief Product Officer, Antoine Leblond as Chief Technology Officer and Selby Drummond as Chief Marketing Officer.\n\nThe shakeup at the top is working if you look at the latest financials; Bumble’s first-quarter sales rose 10.2% to $267.8 million, above Wall Street’s prediction of $265.5 million. The firm also announced above-expected profits.

Some applications include Bumble, Badoo and Fruitz. Bumble uses community-based marketing to acquire users; it entails arranging events and engaging ambassadors who share the brand’s values to attract new users.\n\nBumble is also recognizing 2024 dating trends like “shared values,” and “rebelling against constant improvement rhetoric” to develop the app. Additionally, Bumble may reconsider its distinguishing trait of women making the first move to empower users.

But the jewel in TCEHY’s social media crown is WeChat, which boasts 1.3 billion monthly active users up from just 355 million users in Q4 2013.\n\nOver and above that, the best part about investing in TCEHY is that you gain access to several important business lines with one stock. Its premium position in China and innovation in new areas, such as Tencent Hunyuan, a foundation model for AI, gives it a premium position among social media stocks to buy, illustrated by four consecutive earnings beats.\n\nTencent is also active in terms of industry partnership. It’s collaborating with Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY), two big Japanese companies, to improve AI use in the car industry.\n\nIn addition, Tencent has listed quantum computing, AI-driven industry growth, sustainable computing and other things as some of the top ten technological trends for 2024. These trends show Tencent’s view of the future of technology and how it will affect different fields and daily life.\n\nThe stock last closed at $47.63, perilously close to its 52-week high of $47.75, but the company’s decision to raise its dividend 42% and more than double its share repurchase commitment in 2024 more than offsets the bearish thesis.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "25 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 careers with the most job security in the US. We have also talked about growing concerns about job insecurity due to AI. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Authority Hacker, with a sample of 1200 full-time workers, job insecurity looms large over the American workforce as over half of full-time employees express growing concerns. Strikingly, the tech industry which is largely believed to be synonymous with innovation, is witnessing an increase in anxiety, attributed to recurrent mass layoffs and the specter of AI replacing human roles. According to the survey, men exhibit a higher propensity for job insecurity compared to women, with those earning $150,000 or more exhibiting the highest concern. Moreover, professions most vulnerable to AI disruption such as IT, software development, and advertising, report the most severe cases of anxieties.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that one of the most vulnerable jobs to AI are that of customer service representatives which are also known to have the most oversaturated jobs.\n\nApart from concerns of job insecurity due to AI, job insecurity has been a persistent concern, especially during economic downturns in the US. Despite claims that recessions have become less common over time, skepticism remains due to historical data discrepancies. According to Business Insider, between 1990 and 2023, the US experienced 36 months of recession, compared to 59 months between 1960 and 1989. However, the reliability of recession data before 1950 is questionable which potentially skewes perceptions of historical recession frequency.\n\nSpeaking of economic downturns, in April 2024, the US observed a major slowdown in job growth as employers only added 175,000 positions. This trend was accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate from 3.8% to 3.9%, according to the Labor Department.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates since 2022 also aimed to temper economic expansion and alleviate inflationary pressures. However, with inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target at 3.5% in March, there were doubts about the timing of further rate cuts. Nonetheless, the unexpected slowdown in job growth in April raised expectations for potential rate adjustments later in the year. Despite the tempered job growth, some sectors like healthcare, continued to drive employment gains. Average hourly earnings rose by 3.9% over the 12 months to April, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow that we are talking about job gains, it is worth highlighting that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is set to construct an $800 million data center spanning 715,000 square feet in Montgomery, Alabama. This data center is anticipated to generate 100 job opportunities. Located near the Interstate 65 and Hyundai's automotive assembly plant, the site was announced by Governor Kay Ivey at Montgomery Whitewater and is slated for completion by 2026. Over 1,000 construction workers are expected to be engaged at the peak of its construction.\n\nThis is one of the most significant investments by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in Alabama, following the establishment of its first data center campus in Huntsville in 2021, which currently employs approximately 300 individuals. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s total investment in the state amounts to $1.5 billion.\n\nMontgomery will become home to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s 24th data hub and its 20th in the United States. The city was selected owing to its accessibility to infrastructure, renewable energy availability, and a rich pool of talent. Once operational, the facility is slated to achieve LEED Gold certification, utilize 100% renewable energy, and attain net-zero emissions.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) has announced a monumental investment of $11 billion in Indiana which is expected to generate a minimum of 1,000 job opportunities. With the backing of Governor Eric Holcomb and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will establish new data centers in St. Joseph County to fortify infrastructure and economic growth in the region. Since 2010, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested $21.5 billion in Indiana and hence, has contributed largely to the state's gross domestic product and created over 26,000 full- and part-time positions. 25 Careers with the Most Job Security in the US\n\nAn executive MBA student working late in a study carrel, gaining job-ready skills.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the careers with the most job security in the US, we relied on the growth rates of jobs in the US between 2022 and 2032. The idea is that fastest growing jobs often stem from industries with high demand, innovation, and adaptability. These sectors tend to evolve rapidly that create a plethora of opportunities for skilled workers. This influx of job opportunities contributes to the security of fastest-growing professions by providing a broader range of employment options. For job growth rates, we relied on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USA.\n\nIn case of similar growth rates for any two jobs, the job with a higher number of projected job openings is ranked higher.\n\nPlease note that the data points covering median/average salaries, job growth percentages, and numbers of job openings for each role have been also primarily obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year 2023.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

The shortage of mental health providers worsens the issue as 60% of psychologists report no openings for new patients, as per the APA's 2022 COVID-19 Practitioner Impact Survey.\n\n24.

        "title": "Dividend Payouts Are Latest Sign of Big Tech’s Financial Muscle",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After years of chasing growth at all costs, tech firms are taking a page from the playbook of old-school value businesses — paying a dividend. Throwing off more cash than they can spend, the shift to a regular payout provides more evidence for the companies’ financial strength.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone Ice Cube’s Big3 Basketball League Sells Its First Team in $10 Million Deal Trump Pledges Across-the-Board Tax Cuts If He Returns to Office How One Brooklyn Neighborhood Became a Nightclub Haven\n\nVarious technology firms have introduced quarterly payouts this year, and while the yields are small, the news sparked huge rallies as investors took the initiations as a sign the group can continue to deliver robust cash flows.\n\nAlphabet Inc. last month announced a dividend of 20 cents a share, sparking a 10% gain in the shares of the Google parent. Meta Platforms Inc. in February introduced a 50-cent dividend, which contributed to a historic pop in the stock. Salesforce Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. also launched dividends this year.\n\n“Dividends will be table-stakes for big tech going forward,” said Mark Iong, an equity fund manager at Homestead Advisers. “I think if you don’t pay one, it will now be taken as a sign your business is more volatile.”\n\nThe new dividends in some cases were accompanied by sizable buybacks, demonstrating a renewed focus on shareholder returns as artificial intelligence acts as a tailwind to growth, a combination that investors expect will continue to support share price gains.\n\n“What’s exciting is they are doing dividends and buybacks simultaneously, while also cutting costs and growing, which is them stepping on the pedal for profits across the board,” Iong said.\n\nAmong the so-called Magnificent Seven, only Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. don’t pay a dividend. “It will be difficult for Amazon to not follow suit,” Iong said.\n\nReached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the company’s recent earnings call, during which Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the focus is on capital expenditures and repaying debt, as opposed to shareholder returns. Tesla on its website said it doesn’t anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\nNvidia Corp.’s 4 cent per share quarterly dividend represents a yield of 0.02% and hasn’t been raised since 2018. The chipmaker generated $28 billion in cash last year and returned less than $400 million to investors in dividends and $9.5 billion in stock buybacks. Cash from operations is expected to more than double to $58 billion in the current year, according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Facebook’s parent company are up about 35% this year, while Alphabet is up 21%. Both have outperformed the 7.9% gain in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nHigh cash flow and solid balance sheets are a core reason why megacap technology stocks are well liked on Wall Street. The six biggest megacaps are projected to generate more than $416 billion in combined free cash flow this year.\n\nBuybacks Remain in Favor\n\nStill, repurchasing stock — which supports earnings per share by reducing share count — remains the favored way for these companies to return money to shareholders. The Magnificent Seven have spent almost $58.5 billion on buybacks this year, while allocating less than $11 billion on dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeta’s dividend came with a $50 billion buyback, while Alphabet’s was paired with a $70 billion repurchase authorization. Apple Inc. — which started paying a dividend more than a decade ago — last week announced the largest buyback in US history: $110 billion, exceeding the previous record of $100 billion it set in 2018.\n\n“These companies are still in the thrall of buybacks, and the dividend yields aren’t significant, but I think it is very telling that these companies are moving in this direction,” said Daniel Peris, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes and the author of several books on dividend investing.\n\n“As a dividend investor, a maturing company declaring a dividend is a good sign, but it is only meaningful if the yield adds up, and we’re not there yet,” Peris said.\n\nThe tech firm’s dividend payouts are relatively small, with the indicated yields for both Meta and Alphabet below 0.5% and Apple’s barely higher. To compare, the yield of the S&P 500 Index is 1.37%.\n\nStill, dividends are partially meant to encourage long-term ownership, and the impact compounds over time. Microsoft’s yield is around 0.7%, but that has added up. Over the past 20 years, shares have climbed about 1,500%. Including dividends, however, the rally tops 2,400%.\n\n--With assistance from Tom Contiliano and Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCorporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor ‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "One of the easiest ways to get a reading on whether the market is overvalued is to look at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500. With a P/E of 27, the index looks expensive compared to historic levels.\n\nBut the market is forward looking and cares more about where companies are going than where they have been. Let's dive into some encouraging market data that indicates the S&P 500 might not be as expensive as it looks at first glance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe data\n\nNew findings from business data firm FactSet Research Systems show that 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. For the quarter, the growth rate for the S&P 500 is 5%, the highest level since Q2 2022. Earnings growth has been incredibly strong -- so strong, in fact, that the forward P/E of the S&P 500 is now 19.9.\n\nAccording to FactSet, that level is still above the five-year average of 19.1 and the 10-year average of 17.8, but it is lower than levels seen at the end of the first quarter of the calendar year on March 31.\n\nAccording to Luxembourg-based ISABELNET, a firm that has been doing private research on the U.S. stock market since 1998, consensus analyst estimates for the S&P 500 are $242 for 2024 earnings and $278 for 2025. At a level around 5,200, that would give the S&P 500 a P/E of 21.5 based on the 2024 forecast and 18.7 based on 2025 estimates.\n\nHere's a look at how the forward P/E has performed over the last five years and how it is expected to fall to around 20 by Q2 2025. S&P 500 P/E Ratio Forward Estimate Chart\n\nIn sum, growth is strong, earnings are delivering, and the S&P 500 is at a reasonable valuation.\n\nFaster growth justifies a higher multiple\n\nThe composition of the S&P 500 is currently more growth oriented than in the past.\n\nThe technology sector makes up 29.3% of the index. Consumer discretionary, dominated by Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), makes up 10.4%. Communications services -- heavily weighted in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- makes up 9.2%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which mirrors the performance of the S&P 500, has 30% of its weighting in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a term for seven top tech-focused companies that includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Nvidia alone now makes up more than 5% of the S&P 500.\n\nThe shift toward growth and tech has led to dramatic changes in the S&P 500 and fueled strong gains in the index led by megacap growth stocks. Growth stocks tend to fetch a premium valuation relative to their trailing earnings because investors are willing to pay up for the prospect of future earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith more and more of the S&P 500 allocated to growth stocks, it stands to reason its valuation should be higher than historic levels. By the same token, if the most valuable companies were instead safe, stodgy dividend-paying behemoths, we would expect the S&P 500's multiple to be lower than prior levels.\n\nTo see how growth can make an expensive stock look more affordable, let's look at the forward earnings estimates of the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNotice that Alphabet and Meta Platforms have roughly the same forward P/E as the S&P 500 despite being high-quality cash cows with above-average growth prospects and impeccable balance sheets.\n\nEven Nvidia, which embodies artificial intelligence-fueled market euphoria, has a 35.9 forward P/E -- which is less than half of its current 75.9 P/E ratio -- because consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings to double over the next year.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nThe stock market can do just about anything in the short term. But over the long term, it's all about how much money companies are making and how much they are expected to make in the future.\n\nIf you were to look solely at big tech stock prices or the levels of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, you might conclude that this market rally looks overextended. But earnings have delivered and are backing up the rally.\n\nThe lesson here is that price doesn't dictate value. Growth stocks were way oversold at the end of 2022, so there was some initial catching up to do in 2023. But the rally has persisted since then because of earnings growth.\n\nOverall, the stock market looks healthy and is going up for generally the right reasons. But there will always be pockets of speculation and greed.\n\nTo filter out the noise, focus on the underlying investment theses of the companies you like: their performance, what's driving or hindering results, and whether the valuation makes sense. This approach will help ensure you invest in a company for the right reasons and will allow you to stay on an even keel no matter how choppy the market becomes.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,115!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $34,588!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $329,437!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 6, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "GOOG Stock Analysis: Unlocking the Future Potential of Alphabet in 2024",
        "content": "Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager, advocates owning a small group of stocks. He’s willing to ride these best ideas for years. One of those best ideas is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.38 million Class C and 4.35 million Class A shares. Together, Pershing has nearly $2 billion in Alphabet stock.\n\nAckman’s stake in Google’s parent company accounts for more than 18.5% of his firm’s $10.4 billion in assets reported in its Q4 2023 13-F. With the two share classes combined, Alphabet is Pershing’s second-highest holding by percentage, surpassed only by Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) at just less than 19%.\n\nExcept for Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW), each of Pershing’s seven holdings has a weighting of at least 11%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou could argue that Alphabet stock should be the hedge fund’s largest position. Here’s why.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Alphabet Stock\n\nThrough Q1 2024, Alphabet’s trailing 12-month free cash flow was $69.11 billion, 21.7% of its $318.15 billion in revenue. Adding up the trailing 12-month free cash flow of Pershing’s other six holdings, it comes to $11.88 billion, or about one-sixth Alphabet’s.\n\nBased on the other six’s combined revenue of $129.08 billion, the average margin is 9.2%, less than half of Alphabet’s.\n\nFree Cash Flow Margins — Pershing Square Capital Management Holdings\n\nCompany Free Cash Flow (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Margin Alphabet $69.11 billion $318.15 billion 21.7% QSR International $1.25 billion $7.17 billion 17.4% Lowe’s Companies $6.18 billion $86.38 billion 7.2% Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) $1.32 billion $10.20 billion 12.9% Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) $1.74 billion $10.52 billion 16.5% Howard Hughes Holdings (NYSE:HHH) -$266 million $999 million N/A Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) $1.65 billion $13.81 billion 11.9%\n\nAll the other holdings possess healthy free cash flow, except for Howard Hughes, a real estate developer who doesn’t focus on this financial metric. You can’t go out of business if you bring in more cash than you send out.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Pershing cut its Lowe’s holdings by 82%. Ackman likely left some money on the table as LOW stock hit a 52-week high of $262.49 in March. I would not be surprised if Pershing sold out of its Lowe’s position in the first quarter, given it paid an average of $100.43 a share.\n\nIf you take out Lowe’s numbers, the free cash flow margin for the other five stocks jumps to 13.3% [free cash flow of $5.70 billion divided by $42.70 billion], 840 basis points less than Alphabet.\n\nThere is no question that Alphabet is the best free cash flow generator.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Does It Compare to the Other Magnificent 7 Stocks?\n\nThere are 64 analysts covering GOOG/GOOGL stock, with 50 rating it a Buy with a $195 target price, 14% higher than where it currently trades. So, that’s 78% of analysts rating it a Buy.\n\nHere’s how it compares to the other Mag 7 stocks.\n\nAnalyst Buy Rating Percentages — Magnificent 7 Stocks\n\nCompany # of Analysts  Buy Rating % Alphabet 64 78% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 46 65% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 59 95% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 65 97% Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 59 88% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 51 41% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) 67 85%\n\nAt least from the perspective of analysts, Alphabet is not the favorite Mag 7 stock.\n\nI won’t review all the free cash flow margins for the other six Mag 7 stocks. However, Amazon, which has the highest Buy percentage at 97%, has a free cash flow margin of 7.7% based on $45.70 billion in TTM free cash flow and $590.74 billion in revenue.\n\nIn fairness to Amazon, if you exclude its e-commerce revenue, the free cash flow generation is much stronger. With all it has going with its ad business and AI, its free cash in about five years will be considerably more impressive. It’s not hard to see why so many analysts rate it a buy.\n\nNext up is Microsoft, which has a 95% Buy percentage. It’s more of an apples-to-apples comparison. Its free cash flow margin is 29.8% based on $70.58 billion in TTM free cash flow and $236.58 billion in revenue.\n\nSatya Nadella is one of the best CEOs in America. Since taking the helm on Feb. 4, 2014, MSFT stock is up 1020%, 544 percentage points higher than Alphabet over the same period.\n\nMSFT is the class of the Mag 7.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GOOG Stock\n\nLast December, I wrote about how Alphabet was spending money in all the wrong places. Notably, it had repurchased more than $100 billion of its stock over the previous two years. And while its underperforming shares made some buybacks worthwhile, it should have invested at least 50% of these funds in its business.\n\nThe company’s employees are fed up with shareholders getting all the benefits of its strong free cash flow.\n\n“Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases,” Fortune reportedCNBC comments made by an employee after the company’s blowout quarter. “When will employee compensation fairly reflect the company’s success and is there a conscious decision to keep wages lower due to a cooling employment market?”\n\nIf you can only buy one Mag 7 stock, Microsoft is the call. However, Alphabet’s free cash flow always keeps it in the mix.\n\nAlphabet is a Moderate Buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Nasdaq Stocks That Could Crush Nvidia and Deliver Bigger Gains, Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has been in fine form in the past year, clocking impressive gains of 50%, as some of the key components of this index have witnessed a red-hot rally thanks to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nShares of Nasdaq-100 component Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), for instance, have shot up 221% in the past year. The chipmaker's terrific rally is justified by its outstanding growth. Nvidia's monopoly-like position in the market for AI chips -- where it holds 95%-plus market share according to some estimates -- has supercharged the company's top and bottom lines, which is evident from the chart below. NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nWhat's more, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to increase at a healthy annual rate of 38% over the next five years. Based on Nvidia's earnings of $12.96 per share in the recently concluded fiscal 2024, its bottom line could jump to almost $65 per share after five years, according to analyst estimates.\n\nEven if Nvidia trades at 30 times earnings after five years, in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple, its stock price could jump to $1,950. That would be a 112% jump from current levels.\n\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only stock that's winning big from the rapid adoption of AI. There are two other Nasdaq stocks that are making the most of the AI opportunity and they could deliver more upside than Nvidia over the next five years.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has outperformed Nvidia in the past year with stunning gains of 505%. Supermicro, which is known for manufacturing AI server solutions, can continue to outperform Nvidia over the next five years, thanks to the fast-growing market it operates in.\n\nSupermicro's servers are deployed by data center operators to mount chips from the likes of Nvidia and other chipmakers, which keeps their operating costs in check. Supermicro's modular server solutions aim to lower electricity and cooling costs in data centers.\n\nFor instance, Supermicro launched liquid-cooled server solutions for deploying Nvidia's massively popular H100 chips in May last year, claiming that they can reduce electricity costs in data centers by 40%. Additionally, Supermicro claims that its liquid-cooled H100 servers could reduce cooling costs by 86% when compared to existing data centers.\n\nConsidering the significant amount of electricity that AI data centers consume, the demand for Supermicro's servers is booming. This explains why the company's revenue and earnings grew remarkably in the previous quarter. Super Micro's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the three months ended March 31) tripled year over year to $3.85 billion. Its earnings jumped fourfold to $6.65 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro's full-year guidance now calls for revenue to increase 110% year over year to $14.9 billion at the midpoint. Earnings are expected to jump to $23.69 per share from $11.81 per share in the same period last year. Even better, analysts are expecting its earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years.\n\nThat won't be surprising as the market for AI servers is expected to clock annual growth of 30% over the next decade. Supermicro is growing faster than the market it serves, which explains why analysts are expecting its earnings growth to remain robust. Assuming the company's bottom line does grow at 60% a year for the next five years, its earnings could hit $124 per share after five years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $3,720 after five years, a 348% jump from current levels. Even if growth rates taper off, Supermicro still has a better growth probability than Nvidia. So, Supermicro looks like a solid alternative to Nvidia for investors looking to buy an AI stock right now, given that it seems capable of outperforming the latter over the next five years.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another tech giant that's capitalizing on the adoption of AI. The social media bellwether has been integrating AI tools into its different platforms and is also leveraging the technology to help advertisers increase returns on their spending.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's AI initiatives in detail on the company's first-quarter earnings conference call last month. He claimed that the company's generative AI assistant, Meta AI, has been tried by \"tens of millions of people,\" and it will be rolled out in more countries and languages in the future.\n\nMeta AI is being integrated into WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. From allowing creators to generate high-quality images to enabling businesses to suggest products for customers, Meta Platforms is setting itself up to monetize its AI offerings in the long run. According to Zuckerberg:\n\nOn the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nThe good news for investors is that Meta's AI offerings are giving the company's growth a nice boost. Its revenue increased 27% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $36.4 billion. Earnings, meanwhile, shot up an impressive 114% year over year to $4.71 per share. Meta should be able to sustain a healthy earnings growth rate in the long run as it starts monetizing more of its AI offerings.\n\nAnalysts are currently expecting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 28% over the next five years, which would be a nice jump over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years. Using its 2023 earnings of $14.87 per share as the base, Meta's bottom line could jump to $51 per share in five years based on the potential earnings growth that analysts expect it to deliver.\n\nMultiplying that with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $1,530 after five years, a 229% jump from current levels. Given that the stock is trading at 27 times earnings right now, investors are getting a good deal on this Nasdaq stock that seems capable of outperforming Nvidia in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $550,688!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy.\n\nThe advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year.\n\nAd Revenue on the Rise for Digital Advertising Companies\n\nIn recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company’s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business:\n\n“...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nSo if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers.

Even after the pullback, the stock has returned 22% over the prior one year. The business, while cyclical due to its ties to ad spend, is a royalty on competition as clients around the world seek Omnicom’s expertise in creating, managing and tracking advertising campaigns. The business generates strong free cash flow, which has funded capital return in the form of share repurchases and dividends (3.8% current dividend yield), and is mostly a cost-plus business, which lessens the risk of margin pressure. Omnicom also has a flexible cost model allowing it to cut overhead during economic downturns to protect operating profit.

        "content": "AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says\n\nThe recent earnings season has made it abundantly clear that the AI revolution is not just knocking on the door but has forcefully entered the tech world.\n\nThe impressive results from tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), AlphabetInc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) underscored this transition, according to Daniel Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush.\n\nThese companies have reported “eye-popping capital expenditure numbers,” initiating an “AI tidal wave” in software and cloud development driven by generative AI.\n\n“The next phase of AI spending is now on the doorstep for the likes of Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and many others,” Ives wrote.\n\nThe expert said companies were “laser-focused on deploying generative AI” across various sectors. Additionally, major players such as Meta and Apple were diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promised significant spending in the coming years.\n\nOther major players like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promises significant spending in the coming years.\n\nIves projected AI and related purchases will account for 8%-10% of IT budgets in 2024, a stark increase from less than 1% in 2023. This surge represented a “massive growth catalyst” in what he referred to as the “initial wave of AI software growth.”\n\nIndustry-Wide Impact and Consumer Trends\n\nIves highlighted Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft as leaders in this burgeoning field, with their influence paving the way for a trillion-dollar spending spree over the next decade.\n\nRecent consumer surveys conducted by Wedbush show “broadly positive” trends for Internet-related groups, with expectations of strong digital advertising growth in 2024.\n\n“Our findings strongly support our expectations for accelerating e-commerce and digital advertising growth in 2024,” Ives said, pointing to bullish indicators for Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft’s ‘iPhone Moment’\n\nDescribing the current phase as Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” Ives believed AI would significantly alter the cloud growth trajectory for the company in the coming years. “We see an acceleration of adoption for generative AI and Copilot activity,” he explained.\n\nThis trend is boosting Azure cloud deal flow for Microsoft, with AI use cases “exploding across the enterprise landscape.” Ives estimated that for every $100 spent on Azure cloud services, there was an additional $35-$40 of AI spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s Foray into AI\n\nLooking ahead, Ives was particularly excited about Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where he anticipates the unveiling of a comprehensive AI strategy.\n\n“We believe Apple is set to unveil its long-awaited AI strategy to its golden installed base and developer community at WWDC,” he said.\n\nThis includes a new iPad lineup and the iPhone 16, which are expected to set new standards in AI technology.\n\n“The AI strategy at Apple will consist of an AI App Store that will be the foundational starting point for developers and AI apps,” Ives said.\n\nRead Now: Utilities Notch 7th Straight Session Of Gains: ‘Potential Derivative Play To The AI Boom’\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "(Adds comment from Bright Data CEO, Meta lawsuit against Bright Data, paragraphs 6, 8)\n\nBy Jonathan Stempel\n\nMay 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit in which Elon Musk's X Corp accused an Israeli data-scraping company of illegally copying and selling content, and selling tools that let others copy and sell content, from the social media platform.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco ruled on Thursday that X, formerly Twitter, failed to plausibly allege that Bright Data Ltd violated its user agreement by allowing the scraping and evading X's own anti-scraping technology.\n\nAlsup said using scraping tools is not inherently fraudulent, and giving social media companies free rein to decide how public data are used \"risks the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest.\"\n\nThe judge also said X was not entitled to \"de facto copyright ownership\" in copyrighted content that X's users made available to the public.\n\nLawyers for X did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.\n\nOr Lenchner, Bright Data's chief executive, said in a statement: \"Bright Data's victory over X makes it clear to the world that public information on the web belongs to all of us, and any attempt to deny the public access will fail.\"\n\nAlsup said X can try to amend its complaint, which sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract, trespass and misappropriation. The San Francisco-based company sued Bright Data last July.\n\nIn January, another San Francisco judge ruled that Bright Data had not violated Meta Platforms' terms of service by scraping data from Facebook and Instagram. Meta ended its lawsuit against Bright Data a month later.\n\nThen in March, another San Francisco judge dismissed X's lawsuit against the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, which published articles based on scraped data that faulted a rise in hate speech on the platform.\n\nX claimed that the articles were scaring away advertisers, costing it millions of dollars, and has appealed the decision.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022. His other businesses include electric car company Tesla.\n\nThe case is X Corp v Bright Data Ltd, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 23-03698.

        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported first-quater 2024 earnings on April 24. In a statement, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \"This is a good start to the year.\" However, despite his positive assessment, the market was clearly disappointed with the company's results and second-quarter guidance as itsstock dropped 12% after the earnings release, which has been a rare occurrence over the past few quarters.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META. List of 52-Week Lows List of 3-Year Lows List of 5-Year Lows\n\nThe last time Meta's stock plummeted was on Oct. 27, 2022, following the company's dismal third-quarter 2022 earnings report. It is obvious that while the first-quarter results were more than satisfactory, investors' expectations were indeed too high.\n\nHighlights of the quarter\n\nMeta reported revenue of $36.50 billion, an all-time high for a first quarter, representing year-over-year growth of 27.30%. This is the fastest revenue growth rate since the third quarter of 2021. However, investors were disappointed the company did not achieve its upper range of guidance of $37 billion. Meta's net income was $12.40 billion, also a record for the first quarter.\n\nThe Family of Apps segment was the main driver for Meta's revenue growth. The Family of Apps segment reported revenue of $36 billion, growing 27% year over year. Of the $36 billion segment revenue, ad revenue was $35.60 billion, also up 27% year over year. The growth of ad revenue is very healthy as it was driven by both volume and pricing. In the first quarter, ad volume (total number of ad impressions) grew 20% while pricing (average price per ad) grew 6%. Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li explained during the earnings call thatwithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand.\n\nInterestingly, when asked about contributions from Chinese-based advertisers, Li refused to quantify the first-quarter contribution from China and declined to provide expectations on quarterly China-based ad revenue. This is understandable as both Temu and Shein are facing more rigorous scrutiny from the U.S. government.\n\nThe Reality Labs segment is still burning cash. This segment's revenue for the period was only $440 million, while incurring $4.30 billion in segment expenses. The operating loss was $3.80 billion.\n\nStarting from this quarter, Meta will no longer report daily active users and monthly active users for its Facebook platform, and it will also stop disclosing the number of monthly active people for its Family of Apps. The only number Meta will disclose going forward is its daily active people for its Family of Apps. For March, Meta's DAP for the Family of Apps was 3.24 billion, an increase of 1.57% quarter over quarter and 7.28% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nImpressive progress of AI\n\nMeta has made impressive progress on its artificial intelligence offerings over the past few months. A week before announcing its earnings results, the company released its latest version of Meta AI powered by its latest model Llama 3. According to Chatbot Arena, which is an open-source research project developed by members from Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS Org) and UC Berkeley SkyLab, Meta's Llama 3's ranking was tied at number six. Meta's previous model Llama 2 did not even make it to the top 10 list.\n\nZuckerberg sounded very excited about Meta AI's progress. During the earnings call, he said:\n\nThe initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries, and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AIS system that you can freely use. We're seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years. And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended.\n\nAs we all know, AI models are extremely costly. Meta has invested heavily in AI capabilities and will continue to do so in the near future. For 2024, the company previously guided for capital expenditures of $30 billion to $37 billion. The company has revised the capital expenditure to $35 billion to $40 billion. This will likely adversely impact near-term earnings.\n\nMiscellaneous items\n\nDuring the quarter, Meta repurchased $14.64 billion worth of stock and paid $1.27 billion in cash dividends. Clearly, the social media giant is still committed to enhancing shareholder returns.\n\nFor the second quarter, management gave a revenue guidance range of $36.50 billion yo $39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.75 billion. The midpoint represents a year-over-year growth rate of 18%, while the upper range represents a year-over-year growth rate of 21.90%. Even if Meta can achieve the upper range of revenue growth, it would still be the slowest revenue growth rate since the third quarter of 2023. Combined with the more-than-expected capital expenditure guidance, it is not surprising that investors may have to lower their expectations for full-year 2024.\n\nIn terms of valuation, at the current market capitalization of approximately $1 trillion, Meta is trading at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 22. It does not look expensive, but also not very cheap either.\n\nConclusion\n\nInvestors' expectations for Meta oscillated from extremely low to extremely high between the third quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2024. It looks like Meta's core Family of Apps ad business will continue to grow in the near term. Going forward, clearly AI will be a big focus for both the company and investors. Personally, I cannot judge whether the huge investment in AI will generate the return on investment Zuckerberg hopes to achieve, but I know if Meta does not invest heavily in the technology, the company will fall behind in the race. Time will tell.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%.

While Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been great at initiating stock buybacks for several years, the company recently announced its first dividend.

A major focus has been on semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and software stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While these industries might still have more upside, the AI impact is likely priced in.\n\nInstead, other companies in adjacent industries could have material upside as AI investment goes into overdrive. During Q1 2024 earnings, hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) disclosed increasing their capital expenditures to support their AI efforts. These capex plans have a straightforward implication: a multi-year AI data center buildout.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis capital expenditure bodes well for these under-the-radar AI stocks whose products go into AI data centers. Their products are integral in supporting the AI revolution.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne major investment area triggered by AI is the buildout of data centers. According to McKinsey estimates, U.S. demand based on power consumption could grow from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 35 GW by 2030. This creates an upside for one of the under-the-radar AI stocks, Vertiv (NYSE:VRT).\n\nDue to the significant computations, AI data centers run hot. That’s why Vertiv’s solutions are key to data center players. The company provides a portfolio of power, cooling and IT infrastructure solutions geared to this industry. For instance, it offers a range of data center cooling solutions to maintain optimal temperature levels.\n\nIndeed, Vertiv is heavily exposed to the data center at 75% of revenues. Furthermore, it is banking on its decades of experience serving the segment. Therefore, management is confident that they will capitalize on the AI trend.\n\nNotably, the company saw 60% organic order growth related to large-scale AI data center projects in Q1 2024. Pipeline velocity surged in the quarter, leading to an $800 million backlog increase, pushing the total to a record $6.3 billion.\n\nDue to the robust demand, Vertiv is ramping up production. Management expects expanding demand as larger projects come online. It will be a top beneficiary as a key supplier of cooling solutions for data centers.\n\nCummins (CMI) A Cummins sign in bright red.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cummings (NYSE:CMI) is mainly an engine and commercial components provider, it is one of the best under-the-radar AI stocks to buy. That’s because it’s one of the primary providers of backup power generators necessary to keep data centers running.\n\nData centers need reliable power at all times. Cummings provides a range of power generators that guarantee unlimited operation hours without limit on the average variable load factor. These backup solutions are critical, especially during power grid outages.\n\nDue to the robust demand, Cummings posted a 21% revenue increase in the North American power generation segment. Similarly, it revealed accelerating data center demand in the Chinese market.\n\nIn the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the robust demand from the data center market. CEO Jennifer Rumsey said they expect power generation revenues to increase 10% to 15% in 2024. She cited the data center market as the main driver and noted that some products were sold out through 2025.\n\nDemand for data center power generation solutions is surging. In line with this, Cummings has increased its revenue growth guidance for the power generation segment from 5%—10% to 10%—15%. This increased optimism makes CMI stock a top buy.\n\nEaton (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nEaton (NYSE:ETN) will be another beneficiary as the data center buildout to support AI innovation accelerates. According to Goldman Sachs, data center power demand will grow at a 15% compounded annual growth rate between 2023 and 2030. This will spur demand for the power distribution and backup power protection equipment Eaton offers for data centers.\n\nToday, Eaton’s equipment is integral to multi-tenant and hyperscale data centers, making it among the best under-the-radar AI stocks. For instance, most data centers use their power distribution equipment, which includes panelboards, switchgear, busways and transformers.\n\nEaton provided an update on the AI data center market after impressive Q1 2024 results. Management expects the market to grow at a 25% CAGR between 2022 and 2025. Additionally, they noted Eaton’s strong position in this market, which accounted for 14% of total revenues in 2023.\n\nRegarding forward growth, CEO Craig Arnold highlighted that orders had doubled over the trailing 12-month period. He also noted that the company had a strong negotiating pipeline. In the quarter, the project negotiation pipeline increased 169% year-over-year.\n\nThese solid fundamentals point to the momentum from AI data center growth driven by AI, big data and edge computing. The secular growth in data center demand makes Eaton one of the top under-the-radar AI stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Smartest Dividend Stocks to Buy With Under $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Big technology companies have always been known for generating price appreciation for investors, but the tide is slowly changing. Personal electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has paid dividends since 2012. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) recently joined the dividend ranks.\n\nMany dividend investors look for cash flow first and foremost. Did you know these three companies have combined for an astounding $220 billion in cash flow over the past year alone? No group of businesses has generated as much cash flow in humanity's history as these technology giants.\n\nNow, they've turned on the spigot, funneling some of those profits to shareholder profits.\n\nHere's the pitch for why each company is among the smartest dividend stocks you can buy for under $1,000.\n\n1. Apple is still among the world's best businesses\n\nThings haven't been perfect for Apple in recent years. The company's growth has stagnated, a sign that Apple has gotten so big that its flagship iPhone product can no longer move the needle. But don't get it mixed up; Apple is still a behemoth that earns more in cash flow than all but a few companies worldwide do in sales. It's still Warren Buffett's top holding, even if the Oracle of Omaha sold some of his stock via Berkshire Hathaway. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nLong-term investors should focus on some very important facts. First, Apple can return more cash to shareholders than any company. It recently unveiled the largest share repurchase program in U.S. history, a $110 billion buyback that will dent the company's share count (and boost earnings per share). Additionally, the dividend has a multidecade runway for growth. The dividend payout ratio is just 15% of cash flow. Apple has all the makings of a future Dividend King, especially as those massive buybacks show how quickly the payout ratio rises as the dividend grows.\n\nMost importantly, Apple is one big product away from newfound growth. More than two billion people have active iOS devices worldwide, and there are growing middle classes worldwide, including in India, where the company is shifting parts of its production. That's a massive distribution network for new products. Plus, Apple still hasn't swung hard at artificial intelligence (AI), so watch out. Apple's best growth is probably behind it, but earnings per share could still have plenty of juice to squeeze.\n\n2. Alphabet is the newest member of the big-tech dividend club\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, recently unveiled its first dividend during its first-quarter earnings. The quarterly payout will add up to $0.80 annually for a starting 0.5% yield. That's obviously not much, but Alphabet is one of the largest cash cows on Earth. Rest assured, that dividend will grow over the decades to come. Think of buying shares today as getting in on the dividend \"ground floor.\" It's only going up from here. If that wasn't enough, Alphabet casually tacked another $70 billion to its ongoing share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet makes most of its money by advertising on Google and YouTube, and while advertising can be sensitive to the economy, Alphabet hasn't suffered a dramatic downturn in its business: GOOGL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nGoogle and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide by a wide margin. Alphabet's advertising revenue is still growing at a double-digit rate, which signals significant cash flow growth still ahead. That should be music to long-term investors' ears. The dividend starts from a minuscule size, just 15% of annual cash flow, so look for a ton of growth over the coming years. Now is a great time to buy and watch your passive income grow.\n\n3. Meta has the makings of a dividend powerhouse\n\nWall Street can be short-sighted. Perhaps that's why Meta's stock has retreated from its highs after CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it clear in Q1 earnings that the company will continue investing heavily in artificial intelligence. But this is an opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up this future dividend superstar at a lower price. Meta's lucrative advertising business involves selling ads on its social media apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and (eventually) Threads.\n\nRemarkably, Meta is converting 35% of its revenue to free cash flow despite spending tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures. Cut those in half, and Meta would convert a staggering 44% of sales to cash. Keep that in mind for the future when capital expenditures eventually recede. META Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nMeta is also growing swiftly; revenue grew 27% year over year in Q1. The company potentially has years of double-digit growth ahead and decades of double-digit dividend increases. Don't let the stock's meager 0.1% yield turn you away. The payout ratio is only about 10% of free cash flow and even less of operating cash flow. Meta is a true compounder -- a business that is growing earnings and the cash it returns to shareholders at a double-digit rate, a gem long-term investors should buy and hold indefinitely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Will Its Colossal Gains Continue or Reverse?",
        "content": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has grown remarkably, soaring approximately 490% in under two years. However, Meta recently saw its most significant market cap decline since 2022, shedding around $200 billion following its Q1 results. The stock received downward revisions in target prices across Wall Street. The crucial question now is whether to buy or sell. Personally, I view this as an opportunity to invest in the stock based on its AI-based growth trajectory. I believe it can keep rising.\n\nWeak Revenue Outlook, Higher AI Spend Disappoint Despite Q1 EPS Beat\n\nMeta’s Q1 adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $4.32 per share. Also, earnings more than doubled year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.20 per share in the prior-year period. Revenues jumped 27% year-over-year to $36.5 billion, meeting consensus estimates by $36.2 billion.\n\nThe revenue jump was fueled by a 27% rise in Advertising revenue (accounts for 98% of total revenues) to $35.64 billion. However, the Reality Labs division (the division that invests in the Metaverse) continued to report losses, amounting to $3.85 billion for the quarter.\n\nDespite the EPS beat, the stock experienced its largest single-day decline (15%) in over two years. This decline can be attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance and higher-than-expected capital expenditures (CAPEX) forecasts.\n\nThe Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent expects Q2 total revenue to range between $36.5-39 billion, while the consensus was pegged at $38.3 million. CAPEX is expected to increase to $35-40 billion versus the prior guided range of $30-37 billion. Further, expenses are expected to increase and are forecasted to continue to increase through next year. For FY2024, total expenses are predicted to range around $96-99 billion versus the prior guided range of $94-99 billion.\n\nMeta Plans to Invest Heavily in Creating Massive AI Infrastructure\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg elaborated on Meta’s heightened investment plans in AI infrastructure. The company aims to inject billions into the AI space and develop its proprietary AI chips, thereby reducing dependence on chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIn terms of newer products, the company also announced that MetaAI, featuring Llama 3 (competing with Microsoft’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini), is poised to become the most efficient AI assistant. This innovation could represent a substantial business opportunity in the coming years, further contributing to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta’s AI investment plans align somewhat with its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the AI domain. While Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported CAPEX of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent $14 billion. Both Google and MSFT plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nHowever, Google and Meta’s shares soared after their recent earnings. On the contrary, Meta’s shares plunged as their capital investments are still not visible in their revenue and earnings growth. For instance, Google and Microsoft’s capital investments in AI are yielding impressive growth in their cloud businesses. However, Meta’s Reality Labs business segment still remains unprofitable, with reported losses exceeding $45 billion since the end of FY2020.\n\nIn essence, while AI spending is translating into direct gains for Google and Microsoft, it’s taking Meta longer to show such returns, turning it into a capital-intensive, cash-sucking endeavor. Therefore, the following question arises: should investors wait and observe or buy the stock at current levels following the recent decline?\n\nIn the long run, Meta’s move to produce its own chips will likely benefit the company significantly by reducing costs associated with expensive GPUs procured from NVDA currently. Additionally, owning its AI infrastructure promises faster and more efficient processing of vast amounts of data for the social media giant.\n\nMeta Stock Is Attractively Valued and Backed by Stable Free Cash Flows\n\nIn terms of its valuation, Meta is attractively valued. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 23.5x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. For the sake of comparison, Microsoft is trading at a P/E of 35x, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at over 50x.\n\nDespite elevated capital expenditures, Meta’s free cash flows remain healthy at $49.5 billion for the past 12 months, or 4.1% of the current market capitalization. It is worth noting that the company started a dividend for the first time in the preceding quarter and continued to buy back shares, implying that management is confident in the company’s fundamentals.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about the stock. Overall, META commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. Meta Platforms stock’s average price target of $530.93 implies 11.73% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Current Stock Price Weakness as a Buying Opportunity\n\nSocial media giant Meta has built a vast user base over time, establishing itself as the clear industry leader. Its steady position among the world’s “Magnificent 7” mega-cap stocks is well-deserved, supported by the continued growth in advertising revenue per user. Notably, Meta’s revenues and margins have been growing impressively, and the integration of AI infrastructure across its portfolio is poised to drive revenues even higher in the coming years.\n\nFor those who missed out on Meta’s remarkable stock rally (second only to NVDA) over the last two years, the current dip presents a buying opportunity, in my view. I personally plan to buy the stock and hold it for the long term.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Renju Jose\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia announced on Friday that it would hold a parliamentary inquiry to look into the negative impacts of social media platforms, saying they have significant reach and control over what Australians see online, with almost no scrutiny.\n\nThe government has criticised social media platforms for not being quick enough to remove violent posts and seeks more oversight over content posted on Meta's Facebook, ByteDance's TikTok and Elon Musk-owned X.\n\n\"Across a range of issues, whether it be the issue of domestic violence, whether it be the radicalisation of our young people, across a range of areas, something that keeps popping up over and over again is the role of social media,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.\n\n\"(They) can be very positive but also can have a negative influence which is there.\"\n\nAlbanese's Labor government is already in a legal fight with Musk's X over a regulatory order asking the platform to take down videos of the stabbing attack on an Assyrian church bishop in Sydney last month.\n\nX said it has blocked the posts for Australian users, but Australia's e-Safety Commissioner says the content should be taken down for all users since it shows explicit violence. Musk has posted memes criticising Albanese, describing the government's decision as censorship.\n\nThe joint parliamentary select committee will also check Meta's decision to withdraw from paying for news in Australia.\n\nMeta declined to comment on the inquiry.\n\nCommunications Minister Michelle Rowland said Parliament needed to understand how social media companies \"dial up and down the content that supports healthy democracies, as well as the anti-social content that undermines public safety.\"\n\n\"This inquiry will provide opportunity and resources for parliamentarians to closely scrutinise these companies and make recommendations on how we can make these platforms accountable for their decisions,\" Rowland said.\n\nThe government said it was still determining the terms and scope of the inquiry and did not specify who it would ask to testify. Some Australian parliamentary inquiries have powers to summon individuals to hearings.\n\n(Reporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Tom Hogue)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&amp;T-Style Breakup Next?",
        "content": "Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week.\n\nNow, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space.\n\nMehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year.\n\nThe case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space.\n\nSpecifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space.\n\nLast week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox.\n\nGoogle is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy.\n\nThe final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023.\n\nRead also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake?\n\nThe case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department. The central argument of the lawsuit is that Google’s control of today’s internet is extensive enough to be considered a monopoly, and that it violated antitrust laws by paying competitor firms, cell phone manufacturers, and wireless internet providers to maintain its position as the default search engine.\n\nThe company then benefitted from the extra traffic via its ad business.\n\nFor its part, Google has argued that its market dominance is merely a result of the superior quality of its products in a fair competition game. While the company has admitted to paying partners and competitors to give its search engine a prime position, it has argued (both in an open letter from September 2023 and in the trial) that web browser developers choose to showcase Google by their own will.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has also argued that competitors like Yahoo or Bing also pay browser developers to receive a preferential position in their software and that it's very easy for users to change the default search engine on any device.\n\nThe importance of the trial is hard to overstate. This case marks the first time the Federal Government has brought a big technology company to court on antitrust charges in over two decades, since a U.S. judge ruled that Microsoft had violated the nation’s antitrust laws in 2000, in a lawsuit initiated by the Justice Department and 19 states in 1998.\n\nThe consequences of the decision could also ripple across several other antitrust lawsuits currently shaking up Big Tech companies, including an ongoing antitrust probe by the Federal Trade Commission into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as well as a probe by the same agency into Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), parent company of Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram.\n\nGoogle is also under fire in Europe, where the EU’s Court of Justice is fining it $2.6 billion over antitrust penalties.\n\nWhat's At Stake For Google?\n\nIn a press release, the Justice Department has compared this lawsuit with other landmark antitrust actions including Microsoft in 1998 and AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 1974 trial which eventually broke the Bell system into several companies nationwide in 1982.\n\nBy the end of last week's arguments, Mehta said he has not arrived at a decision yet. According to CNN, the judge proposed that in order to be able to compete with Google's dominant position, a hypothetical competitor would need to invest billions, not just in developing the complex search tool itself, but also in competing with Google on its billion-dollar exclusivity contracts with web browser developers and device manufacturers.\n\n\"I can't conceive of a world in which some other competitor, particularly a new competitor, could do that. Microsoft couldn't do it,\" Mehta said.\n\nIf Mehta rules in favor of the Justice Department, the trial would move to a second stage, wherein the court would determine which penalties Google should face. In these separate proceedings, plaintiffs and the company would present different ways in which Google should respond in order to relinquish some of its alleged monopolistic power.\n\nPossible avenues would be to break up the company into several units, including a separate one for the Android operating system, which is currently owned by Google, according to Bloomberg. Another possible penalty would be forcing Google to disclose its search data to competitors in order to level the playing field, or forcing the company to give up its exclusivity agreements with other companies.\n\nBill Baer, a former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division told the New York Times that it's unlikely that DOJ. will seek some sort of breakup for the company.\n\n\"It's more likely there will be some sort of restrictions on Google's behavior going forward,\" he said.\n\nNow read: Has Chrome Been Tracking You During ‘Incognito’ Mode?

        "title": "Reddit is maturing as a company, CEO says",
        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) is entering its adult years, and that may turn out well for investors.\n\n\"A lot of things are really starting to click,\" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above).\n\nThe company this week reported its first results since going public in late March — and there was much to prove the bears wrong.\n\nDaily active users increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year.\n\nTotal revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after ringing a bell on the floor in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nHuffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\n\"Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note.\n\nFor Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024.\n\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\n\nThe stock began trading at $47 per share and quickly shot past $53.\n\nShares finished their first day of trading on March 21 at $50.44.\n\nThe stock currently trades at around $50 and received a double-digit percentage boost after earnings this week. Reddit's market cap is now roughly $8.1 billion.\n\nThe company was the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\n\nDespite being in business for almost 20 years, Reddit had never turned a profit before the first quarter. Last year the company saw sales rise 21% year over year to $804 million. The net loss clocked in at $90.8 million.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is also full steam ahead on AI, just like Reddit. In the latest episode of the Opening Bid podcast, Amazon's AWS CEO Adam Selipsky took investors inside the tech giant's AI plans.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Buy Immediately, According to AI",
        "content": "In the late 1970s, Louis Navellier – then a college student, now a senior analyst at InvestorPlace – accidentally beat the market. By running financial data through a Wells Fargo mainframe computer (an enormous privilege at the time!), he came across a model that beat the S&P 500 by a considerable margin.\n\nSince then, he’s developed his system into Portfolio Grader, a quantitative stock-picking system that has trounced the market. It’s found picks like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at $6… Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at under $1…\n\nIn fact, every dollar invested in Louis’s A-graded stocks in 1998 would have risen fiftyfold by 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese quantitative systems are generally focused on finding stocks for the long run. We’re not asking these systems to predict what’s going to happen next week… let alone the next 24 hours.\n\nAnd that matters. Especially if you’re an options trader… active investor… or even a long-term buyer seeking a better entry price. In these cases, it’s essential to know when stocks will rise (and not just which ones).\n\nThat’s where AI trading systems like TradeSmith’s Predictive Alpha come in. These systems analyze hundreds of technical aspects, scouring share prices and volume metrics for “clues” of trader intent. (If you’re a $10 billion fund selling $100 million of stock in a company that only has $50 million of average turnover a day… you’re going to influence prices no matter what.)\n\nThat’s why I’m so excited this week to introduce Jonathan Rose, a veteran trader who has mastered the ins and outs of these types of trades. In his latest Masters in Trading presentation, he outlines the strategies, indicators, and other market clues he uses to notch returns of 197%… 317%… even 1,147% in 30 days or less.\n\nIn the meantime, I’d like to leave you with five tactical picks from TradeSmith’s Predictive Alpha system that our writers at InvestorPlace.com – our free news and analysis site – also have highlighted this week.\n\nThese are five companies we expect will do well over the next 30 days, which makes them the ideal “buy the dip” stocks for a recovering market.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTradeSmith’s Predictive Alpha ranks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as its top pick this week, projecting a 3.6% return over the next 30 days. (That translates to a 52% annualized rate thanks to compounding). The quantitative system sees Nvidia’s recent 15% selloff as overdone.\n\nIt’s admittedly been difficult for investors to stomach Nvidia’s sky-high prices. Even though my own models project that shares could be worth $1,600 by 2027, the company’s eyewatering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios make it seem like an enormous bet on a future that may never arrive.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, Nvidia’s recent pullback now puts prices back into more “normal” territory. Shares now trade at 25 times 2026 earnings – not far from the average S&P 500 firm. And Ian Cooper writes at InvestorPlace.com that these lower prices present a compelling buying opportunity:\n\nNvidia could see even more upside with the AI and metaverse boom. After climbing to a high of $967.66, it’s now back to $830.41. This weakness could be a long-term opportunity. From that last traded price, I’d like to see NVDA run well above $1,000 a share this year.\n\nStrong results from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are also making a bullish case. Last Thursday, the smartphone chipmaker announced that earnings had surged 37% to $2.3 billion, driven by record automotive revenues and strong AI demand. This comes as a stark contrast to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, which had previously announced worse-than-expected Q1 results.\n\nThat tells us that the “AI chip slowdown” seen by some Nvidia rivals are company-specific issues. Nvidia itself continues to score a top A grade in Louis’s Portfolio Grader, and rising analyst earnings estimates suggests that a near-term recovery will soon be underway.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPredictive Alpha similarly rates Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as a perfect “buy-the-dip” stock. The system forecasts a 3.1% upside over the next month.\n\nIn short, investors have become increasingly pessimistic about how much Meta will have to invest in data centers and AI – capital-intensive projects that will yield few immediate results. Wall Street analysts have quietly trimmed their target prices by $5 since last month.\n\nHowever, Meta is now seeing a surge in its core advertising business, with ad volume growth outpacing user growth almost threefold. As Yiannis Zourmpanos puts it in an article on InvestorPlace.com:\n\nA 6% increase in the average price per ad YOY suggests that Meta’s advertising platform is now more efficiently monetized…\n\nLooking forward, Meta will continue to expand its income by investing in data analytics, ad targeting skills, and advertising technologies. Therefore, ad impressions and average ad pricing will continue to rise due to the company’s emphasis on increasing user engagement, growing the ad inventory, and boosting ad relevancy.\n\nElection years are typically excellent periods for advertisers, and we’re seeing old patterns play out at Meta Platforms.\n\nEven better, Meta’s stock currently trades for just 22 times forward earnings, making it one of the cheapest “Magnificent Seven” stock by that metric. Though Wall Street might seem bearish about Meta’s near-term prospects, our quant systems suggest the selloff has now gone too far.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn April, InvestorPlace.com’s Marc Guberti highlighted Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) as a stock to buy whenever the market falters:\n\nRising profit margins and a solid moat are strengthening the company’s long-term prospects. Analysts are bullish on the stock and rated it as a “Strong Buy.” The average price target suggests an 11% upside.\n\nEssentially, Intuit is an “evergreen” stock that tends to make money in both good times and bad. Over the past three recessions, Intuit saw revenues rise double digits as consumers traded down for cheaper online accounting services. And during good times, Intuit also does well as small businesses migrate from pen-and-paper bookkeeping to digitized services like QuickBooks.\n\nA recent selloff in tech stocks now provides us with that market “falter” we’ve been waiting for. Shares of Intuit have now fallen 8% from their peak, which puts it near the top of Predictive Alpha’s list. The quantitative stock-picking system believes shares will recover 3.1% over the next 30 days.\n\nIntuit is expected to announce strong results on May 23. The IRS only began accepting returns on Jan. 29 this year, and so much of Intuit’s early season tax business will be pushed into its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expect revenues to rise 9% to $6.6 billion, and for earnings per share to surge 10% to $9.36. These are phenomenal growth rates for a mature blue-chip firm.\n\nIntuit also earns a high score in both Portfolio Grader (where it scores a “B”), signaling long-term gains to come. The firm is highly profitable and fast-growing, and its recent decline in short interest suggests that bears are beginning to throw in the towel. That makes the tax software firm a rarity: a stock that’s attractive to both short- and long-term investors.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Tuesday, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and a host of other large brands warned that consumers were “starting to crack.” Rising inflation and dwindling savings have begun to impact demand. Starbucks (NYSE:SBUX) also has felt the pinch – same-store-sales declined 3% in Q2.\n\nThat perhaps makes Target (NYSE:TGT) the strangest short-term pick by Predictive Alpha this week. Shares of the retailer are expected to rise 3.1% over the next 30 days, bucking a broader trend of negative consumer news.\n\nThere are several reasons for optimism. As Josh Enomoto notes at InvestorPlace.com, Target is more rock-solid than most realize:\n\nA big-box retailer, Target may face pressure amid the broader economic anxieties. However, as far as its direct peers are concerned, the only consumer base that features a higher average income is the one undergirding Costco.\n\nSecond, Target is also better shielded from the yo-yo demand that has put firms like Starbucks on the defensive. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target, and as the saying goes, “we’ve all got to eat.”\n\nFinally, InvestorPlace.com’s Will Ashworth writes that Target is one of the few firms that has added significant headcount over the past five years and maintained strong returns on invested capital. It’s a faster-growing firm than most realize, and Ashworth previously recommended shares as a bargain buy when TGT traded at around $126.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) A hand holds up the Airbnb (ABNB) logo outside a home in Estonia.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Predictive Alpha highlights Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) this week for its 3% expected return over the next 30 days, a 43% annualized rate of return.\n\nShares of Airbnb are only slightly higher today than when it first went public in 2020. The novelty of home rentals has worn off, and the firm has only managed to meet sky-high IPO expectations, not exceed them.\n\nHowever, this flattish long-term performance masks some incredible moves in Airbnb’s stock. In April 2022, a delayed Covid-19 exit sent shares plummeting 40%. A recovery in tech stocks and consumer demand has since reversed that loss.\n\nJeremy Flint, as he writes at InvestorPlace.com, now believes a bookings boom is set to put Airbnb back on a faster track of growth:\n\nAirbnb’s user base is returning to the platform’s original concept of offering spare space as a budget-friendly alternative to hotels. Despite facing significant challenges, such as a $10 million fine for misleading international customers by listing prices in USD rather than local currencies, Airbnb’s market dominance remains unchallenged…\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Airbnb disclosed nearly a 17% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 15% rise in gross booking value. Spurred by the holiday travel surge, this growth is expected to continue as we move into the spring and summer travel seasons.\n\nSince September, Airbnb has seen the number of shares sold short decline from 34.8 million to just 16.6 million – a 52% drop.\n\nStocks for the Long Short Run\n\nIn 1994, economist Jeremy Siegel published Stocks for the Long Run, an investment tome that was often referred to as “the buy and hold Bible.” By investing in the U.S. stock market and holding on for extended periods, even ordinary investors could turn small investments into vast fortunes.\n\nHowever, critics have since pointed out that not every investor has a 40-plus year investment horizon. Some might not even have five years. And the incredible run that U.S. stock markets saw in the 20th century might fail to repeat in modern times. America, after all, saw its economy move from a middling one to the world’s greatest superpower during this period. (Buy-and-hold investors in Turkey, Argentina, and China have done far worse).\n\nThat means investing in the 21st century will need some combination of long-term investing paired with tactical trading. Nvidia might be a phenomenal long-term stock… but is $700 a good entry price? $800? $1,000?\n\nThat’s where Jonathan Rose’s Masters in Trading Summit comes in.

Furthermore, U.S. commercial TCV increased on a dollar-weighted length basis by 42% sequentially and 107% year-over-year (YOY). Indeed, the distribution of transaction sizes and TCV growth rates over time reflects Palantir’s client acquisition techniques’ scalability, profitability, and contribution to total revenue growth.\n\nMoreover, Palantir had a 22% sequential growth rate and a 55% YOY rise in the number of U.S. business customers. Fundamentally, these trends in consumer preferences and market dynamics propel customer expansion and acquisition with changes in client counts across various industry sectors or geographic locations.\n\nOverall, the client retention rates and prospects for growth inside current customer accounts reflect Palantir’s capacity to increase revenue and long-term valuation growth.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith $4.4 billion in revenue, Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) foundry unit is expected to see significant profitability growth. This potential for margin growth demonstrates Intel’s capacity to seize a sizeable portion of the foundry industry and produce steady, long-term profitability from its chip-making operations. This is reflected in the strong interest in Intel 18A and the company’s strong pipeline of around 50 test chips.\n\nFurther, Intel introduced a new operational model that improved responsibility and transparency throughout the company. This is resulting in enhanced productivity and budgetary restraint. Thanks to this restructuring, Intel can better spend resources wisely, make well-informed choices, and maximize its financial performance.\n\nLastly, Intel released its Q2 sales estimate, predicting revenue in the $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion range. The company also projected growth in all areas over H2 2024. With this guidance, investors will understand Intel’s performance and future growth possibilities. Therefore, this reflects the company’s commitment to financial openness and responsibility.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading the way in AI advancement, Meta (NASDAQ:META) focuses on creating cutting-edge AI capabilities to improve user experiences and spur expansion. The company’s AI-powered assistant, Meta AI, has garnered tremendous user acceptance and interest, as exhibited by the tens of millions of individuals who have previously tried it.\n\nAdditionally, billions of parameters are included in Meta’s AI models, such as Llama 3, which are critical to obtaining high performance and accuracy levels in AI applications. The money from Meta’s end-to-end AI-powered products, such as the Advantage+ app’s marketing and purchasing, has more than doubled over the previous year, proving the practicality of AI-driven solutions for business.\n\nMoreover, over 3.2 billion individuals use one or more of Meta’s apps every day. This number demonstrates the enormous size of Meta’s user base, which offers a sizable market for its goods and services. The size of Meta’s user base alone attests to its deep market penetration. Hence, with billions of daily users, Meta has solidified its place as a top technology firm, making a big impact on the worldwide digital scene.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

Strong demand, especially in the desktop and mobile sectors for AMD’s most recent generation of Ryzen central processing units (CPUs) was the main driver of this development.\n\nMoreover, AMD’s Ryzen Pro 8000 series of CPUs for business PCs and other Ryzen portfolio expansions were vitally introduced. This helped increase the company’s revenue and market share in the client segment. AMD improves its competitive stance in the client market by increasing its ability to accommodate a wider variety of customer demands and preferences through the diversity of its product offerings.\n\nAdditionally, AMD expects the client segment to continue growing in the future. This is due to the introduction of the next generation of Ryzen mobile processors and the continuous acceptance of Ryzen processors. Lastly, the company cooperates with partners like Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) on AI-powered PC products, fortifying its competitive stance in the customer market.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ).

These advantages then contribute to its potential for quick expansion. The strategic effort of Afterpay to expand into more in-demand areas is a response to the wide range of consumer preferences. When asked whether they would be more readily available, 67% of customers said they would be prepared to utilize “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services more regularly. This reflects the popularity of these alternative payment methods, especially with Gen Z and Millennial customers.\n\nAdditionally, Afterpay’s core strength, which adds to its potential for quick expansion, is its focus on fostering financial responsibility and consumer trust. The percentage of transactions with no late penalties (98%), the timely installment payment rate (95%), and customer-reported benefits, including less financial stress (77%), improved financial management (67%), and higher savings (60%) are just a few of the progressive measures.\n\nOverall, these figures demonstrate how Afterpay has successfully promoted financial stability. This has increased client loyalty.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PLTR, INTC, META and AMD.

        "content": "By Byron Kaye\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Meta's oversight board upheld a decision to remove two Facebook posts calling for Australians to vote multiple times in an indigenous rights referendum, but noted the social media giant had not adequately explained its ban on encouraging voter fraud.\n\nThe board, which is funded by Meta but run independently, said Meta was correct to protect the democratic process by preventing voter fraud when it proactively pulled the posts ahead of the 2023 vote.\n\nBut Meta's public-facing rules were not clear enough, the board said in a ruling published on Thursday.\n\n\"Since it is crucial that users can engage on social media to discuss public-interest issues about democratic events, Meta needs to clearly inform users of the rules,\" it said.\n\nThe decision comes as Australia's government plans to introduce penalties for internet platforms which fail to rein in misinformation and disinformation. Last October, Australians voted down a proposal to constitutionally recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people amid fears that a misinformation campaign was influencing voters.\n\nIn the posts under review, two Facebook users separately uploaded screenshots showing partial statements posted by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe screenshots showed the words \"if someone votes at two different polling places within their electorate, and places their formal vote in the ballot box at each polling place, their vote is counted\". The posts failed to mention that voting multiple times is an offence in Australia.\n\nOne Facebook user shared the screenshot with the caption \"vote early, vote often, and vote NO\", while the other user posted the screenshot with the comment: \"so you can vote multiple times ... they are setting us up for a 'rigging' ... smash the voting centres ... it's a No, No, No, No, No\".\n\nIn both cases, Meta proactively identified the posts, which were automatically sent for human review before being removed, but the users appealed the decision, the oversight board said.\n\nThe board said in its ruling that in both cases users were engaged in political debate but they could not call for others to engage in illegal behaviour that impacted the rights of others, particularly the right to vote.\n\n\"While the calls to 'vote no' are protected political speech, the phrases 'vote often' and 'smash the voting centres' are a different matter,\" it added.\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Could Easily Take On More Debt",
        "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms's Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2024 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.93b, over one year. But on the other hand it also has US$58.1b in cash, leading to a US$39.7b net cash position. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nA Look At Meta Platforms' Liabilities\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$28.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$45.2b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$58.1b in cash and US$13.4b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.77b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nHaving regard to Meta Platforms' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.19t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Meta Platforms also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.\n\nOn top of that, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 72% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Meta Platforms can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Meta Platforms may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Meta Platforms generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Meta Platforms has US$39.7b in net cash. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$50b. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Meta Platforms  you should know about.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Insiders at the Magnificent Seven tech companies are following Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg in realizing gains from the stocks that have largely powered the boom in US equity markets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Arm Slides as Tepid Outlook Fuels Concerns Over AI Slowdown Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump’s Demeanor\n\nAlmost a dozen executives and directors at the firms recently boosted their share sales, earning more than $160 million since late 2023 after not cutting their stakes in as long as nine years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTake Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai. He’s already sold more stock in Google’s parent company this year than in all of 2023, pocketing $30 million overall from almost two dozen sales filed as recently as this month. Alphabet’s shares have gained more than 90% since the start of last year.\n\nRead More: Google Founders’ Hand-Picked CEO Nears Billionaire Status Too\n\nNvidia Inc. director Mark Perry has sold more stock so far this year than in the previous two years. And Apple Inc. Chairman Arthur Levinson filed in February to offload his biggest chunk of the iPhone-maker’s stock in more than two decades.\n\nA representative for Alphabet said Pichai’s sales were done through a trading plan. Nvidia declined to comment, while Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe moves underscore how Silicon Valley insiders are monetizing their holdings after tech stocks rallied to fresh records, rebounding from a 2022 slump caused by accelerating inflation and interest-rate hikes. Nvidia is the best performer among the Magnificent Seven stocks — and third-best on the S&P 500 Index — this year with an 83% gain.\n\n“They all understand that pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered,” said Lloyd Greif, founder of Los Angeles-based investment bank Greif & Co. “No one can time the top of the stock market perfectly, and it certainly looks pretty frothy right now.”\n\nThe cohort of seven tech companies that also includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. has risen nearly 150% since the start of last year, partly because of investors’ appetite for any stocks that offer exposure to artificial intelligence.\n\nRecent quarterly earnings showed the rally still has legs, with all except Meta gaining after their reports. Nvidia, scheduled to report later this month, is the only Magnificent Seven company that has yet to release results.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven insiders in the companies that aren’t doing well are selling. Unlike its Magnificent Seven peers, Tesla’s share price has slumped this year but that hasn’t stopped Chair Robyn Denholm filing this year to sell about $52 million of the electric-vehicle maker’s stock after not touching her stake since 2022.\n\nThe Australian native, who filed a 10b5-1 trading plan in October to help her unload stock options expiring this year, joined Tesla’s board in August 2014. The company’s shares have climbed more than 800% since the end of that month, meaning she’s most likely sitting on big gains even with the recent slump.\n\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nBezos, Zuckerberg\n\nThe biggest overall winner from the Magnificent Seven’s recent rally is Amazon founder Bezos, who netted about $8.5 billion unloading stock over less than two weeks in February. The sales, his first since 2021, came shortly after he announced that he was moving to tax-free Florida from Washington state, which recently introduced a capital gains tax.\n\nRead More: Jeff Bezos Reaps Florida Tax Benefit With $4 Billion Amazon Sale\n\nZuckerberg’s trust as well as entities for his charitable and political giving began unloading shares through a trading plan in November and they’ve since filed to sell more than $1 billion worth. The latest of those sales was well timed, as Meta’s stock price has since fallen about 5% since then.\n\nA representative for Zuckerberg said he mainly sells shares through trading plans to fund his and his wife Priscilla Chan’s philanthropy.\n\nBezos, 60, and Zuckerberg, 39, have a combined fortune of about $378 billion, with most of their wealth still tied up in their Amazon and Meta stakes, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nPut all the insider transactions together, and “you feel they are calling a bit of the top of the market,” said Claire Madden, managing partner of London-based private equity firm Connection Capital.\n\nSome top leaders are offloading shares for the first time.\n\nAlphabet President Ruth Porat netted about $6.6 million selling shares in the search-engine giant in March, her first ever sales since she joined the Silicon Valley company in 2015 after spending more than two decades at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAlphabet’s stock has surged more than 500% since Porat swapped Wall Street for California. With US presidential elections later this year and the Federal Reserve indicating it’s not cutting interest rates just yet, it’s not surprising many insiders are cashing in on the recent rally, Greif said.\n\n“No one wants to get caught standing in a game of musical chairs when the music stops,” he said.\n\n--With assistance from Rita Nazareth and Jack Witzig.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "Excessive Executive Pay: 3 CEOs Raking in Too Much “Other” Compensation",
        "content": "The conversation around overpaid CEOs is a subject near and dear to my heart.\n\nNothing is more annoying than reading about David Zaslav’s ongoing personal enrichment while Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) shareholders see the value of their investment continue to shrink. Most recently, I discussed Zaslav’s outrageous compensation at the end of April.\n\nIf a CEO needs to be fired, he is it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnyway, Fortune published an article around the same time that discussed Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg’s $24.4 million in “other compensation” in 2024.\n\nAlthough Zuckerberg’s only other compensation is a token $1 annual salary, the world’s fourth-wealthiest person ($166 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index) should be able to afford his own personal security. Perhaps it’s an insurance thing that requires the company to cover it. Who knows?\n\nWho else has significant “other compensation?”\n\nHere are three more overpaid CEOs other than Zaslav.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google pay logo\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai’s total compensation in 2023 was considerably less than the $226 million he received a year earlier. However, in the past three fiscal years, Pichai’s “other compensation” totaled $17.1 million, with only $6.8 million for personal security in 2023.\n\nSo what was the other $10.3 million for? According to its proxy, it included up to $11,250 for a 401(k) or Roth company match and personal use of a company car and aircraft. That’s a lot of flights.\n\nWhile he didn’t get any stock awards in 2023, he realized $155.4 million from stock that vested in the past year, providing the CEO with plenty of cash to pay for these flights.\n\nHowever, with GOOGL stock up 57% over the past year and the company announcing a $0.20 quarterly dividend starting in June, shareholders are probably willing to cut him some slack.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) CEO Nikesha Arora received a total compensation of $151.4 million in fiscal 2023 (July year-end). Of that, $145.4 million was for stock awards.\n\nOver the past three fiscal years, the CEO’s total “other compensation” was $6.5 million. Payments included life insurance and disability insurance premiums, $30,000 for a regulatory filing for ownership of the tech company’s stock, personal security, personal use of an aircraft, and the payment of $286,043 to cover the taxes for the personal use of the aircraft.\n\nThat’s a decent chunk of money shareholders are covering. However, compared to the $162 million realized in fiscal 2023 for option exercises and stock vested during the year, on top of the $145.4 million in stock awards, the CEO shouldn’t have too many problems paying for family vacations using the company jet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOh, and let’s not forget, Arora owns 3.9 million shares of Palo Alto stock worth $1.2 billion. That’s a lot for a hired gun and not a founder.\n\nHowever, with its stock more than quadrupling since Arora became CEO in June 2018, I’m sure shareholders will let it slide.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) CEO and co-founder Jason Robins generated total compensation of $20.8 million, $47.5 million, and $14.0 million in the past three years. That’s not nearly as much as the Alphabet and Palo Alto CEOs.\n\nIn the past three years, Robins’ “other compensation” totaled $5.6 million. According to its summary compensation table, it was for security ($1.1 million), air travel costs ($1.1 million), a matching 401(k) contribution ($9,900), financial planning services ($15,925), the purchase of tickets, travel and accommodations to Company-sponsored events during the year ($61,095), and tax reimbursements ($353,335).\n\nConversely, Robins is only paid $1 a year for salary. That makes sense, given he owns 13.67 million Class A shares and 393.01 million Class B valued at $17.6 billion. He can afford to go without.\n\nIn 2023, Robins generated $86.9 million from options exercises and stock vesting, so there’s not going to be a tag day for the CEO.\n\nI will say this about Robins and the other two CEOs: They might be overpaid, but at least their company’s shares have performed reasonably well in recent years.\n\nAs long as shareholders don’t protest, companies will continue to overpay their CEOs, believing they must pay top dollar for top talent.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Big Tech is embracing a hallmark of pre-internet stocks",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nA fresh Big Tech boomlet has arrived.\n\nShareholders aren't just seeing their stock prices swell, they are getting paid too. The dividend, its importance demoted over the past couple of decades by the tech boom, is having a moment again thanks in part to the same companies that made it passé.\n\nIn February, META (META) initiated a dividend, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed in April. And then came an increase from Apple (AAPL) last week.\n\nBut why are tech companies initiating payouts, and why now?\n\nThe dividend trend reflects the double role that tech giants hold in society and on Wall Street. They want to be perceived as growth engines, obsessed with frontier tech and fixated on reshaping the future. But they are also mature, cash-rich companies with market caps that start with a \"T.\"\n\nThe former fledglings are now apex predators, seasoned with decades of experience balancing new investments with their core business, which happens to be expanding to virtually every domain of life.\n\nStartup versions of these companies would scoff at the idea of paying back a dividend. It suggests their growth days are behind them, that executives don't have a vision for how to deploy their resources. But in this post-pandemic, pre-AI moment, Big Tech wants to prove they can do two things at once: build the infrastructure to dominate the coming era and show investors they have the fiscal discipline and confidence to return value consistently.\n\nThat the recent wave of dividend announcements has come alongside disclosures of ballooning AI spending reinforces the dual message.\n\nBut it also reflects a reenergized corporate America that has shaken off fears of the recession that never was. Earnings are rising and with it are massive stock buybacks. The recent wave of repurchases, including Apple's record-breaking $110 billion plan, is the largest sum of buybacks since 2018.\n\n\"These companies have seen record profits for some time now and are finding value in passing that profit to shareholders rather than capex,\" said Alex McGrath, chief investment officer at NorthEnd Private Wealth. \"Not to say they are not still heavily investing in growth, but the cash flow has now reached a point where this begins to make sense.\"\n\nShareholder payouts, even modest ones from the tech companies, also grant them entry into funds that require a dividend. They are broadening their pool of investors, drawing from portfolios that seek steady income from dividends and people who simply want to see the \"number go up\" on their brokerage accounts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was the staggering gains of internet companies that played a part in making the dividend seem stodgy and antiquated. Top members of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\" come from the consumer staples and industrials sectors. When you typically think of dividends, you're disconnected from ideas of rapid growth, more risk, and big gains.\n\nBut the mega tech companies have changed. And so has what a dividend company looks like. Just look at Mark Zuckerberg's glow up.\n\n\"If they keep the money internally, there is a tendency to have waste. By paying it out, it instills discipline,\" said Jennifer Koski, professor of finance at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington, who has been teaching dividend cases for the Big Tech companies since before Microsoft (MSFT) initiated its own in 2003. \"The AI spending is their signal we still do have growth opportunities.\"\n\nIn a sign of where things are headed, Koski is planning to teach her next payout policy case. This time, on Amazon (AMZN).\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter @hshaban. morning brief image\n\nView comments",

(AP) — New Mexico’s top prosecutor announced charges Wednesday against three men who are accused of using Meta’s social media platforms to target and solicit sex with underage children.\n\nThe arrests are the result of a monthslong undercover operation in which the suspects connected with decoy accounts that were set up by the state Department of Justice. The investigation began in December around the time the state filed a civil lawsuit against the social media giant, claiming Meta was failing to take basic precautionary measures to ensure children were safe on its platforms.\n\nNew Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said during a news conference Wednesday that the suspects communicated and exchanged explicit sexual content through Facebook's messenger app and were clear in expressing a sexual interest in children.\n\n“It’s extraordinarily concerning to us just how easily these individuals found the undercover personas that were created,” Torrez said. “And it is, frankly, I think a wakeup call for all of us to understand just how serious these kinds of threats are.”\n\nHe placed blame on Meta executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and suggested that the company was putting profits above the interests of parents and children.\n\n“For those of us who are engaged in this work, we are simply tired of the rhetoric,” he said. “We are tired of the assurances that have been given to members of our communities, to members of Congress, to policymakers that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that this type of behavior doesn’t occur.”\n\nMeta disputed the allegations and reiterated Wednesday that it uses technology to prevent suspicious adults from finding or interacting with children and teens on its apps and that it works with law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting offenders.\n\nThe company also said it has hired child safety experts, reports content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and shares information and tools with others to help root out predators.\n\n“This is an ongoing fight, where determined criminals evolve their tactics across platforms to try and evade protections,” Meta said in an emailed statement.\n\nWhile the state attorney general's office will continue working to identify predators who are targeting children, Torrez said it's too early to say whether that work will have a bearing on the civil litigation.\n\nAs part of that lawsuit, New Mexico prosecutors say they have uncovered internal documents in which Meta employees estimate about 100,000 children every day are subjected to sexual harassment on the company's platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe three defendants in the criminal case were identified as Fernando Clyde, Marlon Kellywood and Christopher Reynolds. Prosecutors are seeking to detain them pending trial on charges that include child solicitation by an electronic communication device.\n\nHearings have yet to be scheduled, and court records did not list attorneys who could speak on behalf of Clyde and Kellywood. A message was left with the public defender's office, which is representing Reynolds.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Buying promising stocks before everyone else notices can set you up for a big payday. Some hidden gems can deliver outsized returns, but great opportunities are also hidden in plain sight.\n\nInvestors can find many large market-cap stocks trading at significant discounts. Those deals shouldn’t last forever, and accumulating shares while prices are low can lead to more gains.\n\nFinding long-term stocks can make investing simpler. You won’t have to monitor daily price fluctuations or study much technical analysis. These are some of the best stocks to buy before they pop.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has outperformed the stock market for several years. The cybersecurity firm has almost quintupled over the past five years and has gained 24% year-to-date.\n\nMore businesses are turning to CrowdStrike to protect themselves from cyberattacks. The financial costs and reputation damage from cyberattacks are too great for most companies to risk. CrowdStrike provides a solution that has turned into $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\nThe company closed out the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 on a high note with 33% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and $53.7 million in GAAP net income. Profits made a big turnaround as the company reported a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in Q4 FY23.\n\nCrowdStrike continues to grow as other cybersecurity companies report much slower revenue growth than just a year ago. The stock has approval from many analysts with its Strong Buy rating. The average price target implies a 27% upside.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has been winning more attention. The credit and debit card issuer has been a household name for decades, but strong financial results and a low valuation are raising demand for the stock.\n\nLet’s start with the valuation. While most credit card companies have P/E ratios above 30, American Express only has a 19 P/E ratio. American Express would have to gain more than 50% from current levels just to be valued at the same level as its peers. That offers a good margin of safety.\n\nFinancials are another area of strength. American Express grew its revenue by 11% YoY in Q1 2024. Net income soared by an astonishing 34% YoY. The fintech firm attracted many younger consumers. More than 60% of its new cardholders from the quarter were Millennials and Gen Z consumers. To top it all off, investors receive a 1.19% yield just for holding onto their shares. American Express does a good job hiking its dividend, raising its payouts by 17% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) makes it easier for people to learn new languages. The educational app trades at a $11 billion market cap and a lofty 700 P/E ratio. The valuation will scare away many value investors, but the stock is delivering impressive financial growth that can reward patient investors. As profit margins continue to improve, the valuation should become more reasonable.\n\nDuolingo is reporting high growth numbers in the areas that matter: revenue, profits and user growth. Revenue increased by 45% YoY in Q4 2023, while net income reached $12.1 million. Meanwhile, the company posted a $13.9 million net loss in Q4 2022. The switch to profitability has significantly strengthened the bullish thesis.\n\nDaily active users grew by 65% YoY to reach 26.9 million people. The educational app also had 88.4 million monthly active users, 46% higher than in the same period last year. Those growth rates should help the company rally. If net income continues to expand, the valuation will look more enticing for people who accumulate shares at current levels.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe mega-cap tech giant is an undervalued opportunity hidden in plain sight. You may have used Google to find this article and saw some ads along the way. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leader in online advertising, and its profit margins are getting more attractive.\n\nRevenue increased by 15% YoY in Q1 2024, while net income soared by 57% YoY. Cost cutting has been working wonders for the company’s profits, just as it did for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Alphabet is getting lean and more efficient while delivering top-line growth.\n\nAlphabet only trades at a 26.3 P/E ratio despite its lead in the advertising industry. Gemini offers enticing opportunities in artificial intelligence that aren’t fully reflected in the company’s stock price. Furthermore, Google Cloud is gaining more market share in the cloud computing industry. Cloud revenue growth outpaced advertising revenue growth, now making up more than 10% of the company’s business model. The stock looks reasonable at current levels.\n\nD.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is a home construction company with a $50 billion market cap and a 10 P/E ratio. It also trades at a reasonable 0.60 PEG ratio. The stock has outperformed the market with a 252% gain over the past five years.\n\nShares have only inched up by 1% year-to-date, but the company has been posting good financial results. Revenue increased by 14% YoY in Q2 FY24, while net income surged 24% YoY.\n\nD.R. Horton offered fiscal 2024 revenue guidance that ranges from $36.7 billion to $37.7 billion. That represents mid-single-digit YoY growth from fiscal 2023 results. The firm also has an excellent reputation with its dividend. D.R. Horton hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share in 2023, a 20% YoY increase. The company also delivered an annualized dividend growth rate of 22.05% over the past decade.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) Image of the foundation and frame of a house\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a smaller construction company receiving a lot of love from investors in the know. The $3.8 billion corporation has a 26.2 P/E ratio and has gained 40% year-to-date. It’s also up by almost 1,000% over the past five years.\n\nThe construction company reported another strong quarter. Revenue increased by 9% YoY in Q1 2024, while net income jumped by 58% YoY. Rapidly expanding profit margins will further reduce the P/E ratio and make it a compelling pick for long-term investors.\n\nThe company’s E-Infrastructure Solutions continue to attract plenty of clients. Sterling expects high single to low double-digit revenue growth in this segment for 2024. The infrastructure firm also anticipates a strong 2024 due to its backlog.\n\nSterling also raised its 2024 guidance. The company came into the year with net income guidance of $155 million to $165 million. The new guidance now suggests Sterling Infrastructure can generate $160 million to $170 million in net income.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a high-growth sports beverage company expanding internationally. While revenue growth took a back seat in the first quarter, profit margins expanded considerably.\n\nCelsius reported 37% YoY revenue growth in Q1 2024. Most of the company’s revenue came from domestic sales, but international sales exhibited 43% YoY growth. The company has plenty of opportunities to reaccelerate revenue growth as it taps into global markets.\n\nThe 89% YoY jump in net income still makes the stock attractive despite the growth deceleration. Celsius Holdings generated $77.8 million in GAAP net income. The stock is still up 42% year-to-date and has gained almost 5,000% over the past five years. Investors shouldn’t expect the 5-year gains to repeat, but Celsius Holdings still has the makings of a stock that can outperform the market in the long run. The pullback after earnings has created a long-term buying opportunity.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG and CELH.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still losing billions of dollars on the metaverse. In fact, in the company’s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent a good deal of time talking about how Meta loses money, including the $3.8 billion it lost on the metaverse. Still, Zuckerberg isn’t giving up on the metaverse just yet, which is creating opportunity for some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today.\n\nInstead, he’s now associating his metaverse plans with artificial intelligence. As noted by a LinkedIn.com article, “Zuckerberg believes that the integration of AI and the metaverse will revolutionize the way we interact with technology and each other.”\n\nEven companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are selling “real world” goods in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) gaming environment, which is reigniting metaverse commerce, says ChainStoreAge.com.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n“Walmart’s IRL commerce shop in its Roblox experience enables users to check out real world items chosen by its partner user generated content (UGC) creators. Walmart is adjusting its merchandising strategy to fit the metaverse, which by itself should make metaverse and retail observers sit up and take notice,” they added.\n\nIn short, don’t off the metaverse just yet. Instead, you may want to use weakness as an opportunity with some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today, such as:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A child playing Roblox on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Katya Rekina/ Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best metaverse stocks to buy today is Roblox.\n\nFor one, after plummeting to a low of $33.71, Roblox is exploding higher. Last trading at $40.54, if it can break above double-top resistance, it could test $43 next.\n\nTwo, the company is opening a new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD). By doing so, advertisers will be able to reach more than half of its 71.5 million daily active users.\n\nThree, Roblox is also running on a JPMorgan upgrade, with a price target of $48.\n\n“The crux of our bull thesis is that we believe RBLX has a significant monetization opportunity ($0.06 per hour with 80% of hours not monetized) and [management’s] focus on margin leverage, which we expect to result in FCF compounding 40%+ through 2027,” said the firm, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s also the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to name a few of them.\n\nAt the moment, the ETF trades at just under $12.50, so I can spend about $1,250 for 100 shares. And I can diversify with the fund’s 38 holdings. Or, I can go out and just buy 100 shares of Nvidia and spend closer to $91,000.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $7 in late 2022, the ETF exploded to a recent high of $12.49. From here, if the metaverse story can gain traction, it could double, if not triple in value—with a good deal of patience. With the METV ETF, simply buy it, forget about it, and check back in on it in a few months.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown but not out, shares of Unity Software are sitting at strong support. In fact, if you pull up a two-year chart, you can see it’s holding and bouncing from the same support level for the seventh time since Nov. 2022. From its current price of $25.32, based on history, we’d like to see it retest around $35 a share.\n\nHelping, analysts at William Blair have a buy rating on the stock. Analysts at Wedbush have an outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $33.50.\n\nAnd, as noted by Investorplace contributor Jeremy Flint, “Unity generates positive cash flow through a substantial advertising network. The ability to generate profit bolsters Unity’s stability amid broader market volatility, sustaining the company until metaverse investments garner broader institutional appeal.”\n\nMuch like the METV ETF, buy Unity Software, forget about it, and check back in on it in a few months. I’d like to see this one double, with patience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) AI push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros packing an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit.\n\nBut it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.\n\nBut the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will serve up at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.\n\nThe M4 and AI\n\nApple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.\n\nMillet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nOutside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly.\n\nThe company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths.\n\nStill, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important.\n\nThe company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party.\n\nCEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months, and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.\n\nThat includes buying up smaller AI firms, and, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, holding talks with both OpenAI and Google about potentially using their large language models to power Apple’s AI experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expect Apple’s generative AI offerings to serve as a catalyst in helping to boost iPhone sales at a time when consumers are increasingly holding on to their phones longer and splashy new features differentiating one generation from another are in short supply.\n\nNow Apple just has to deliver.

        "content": "Companies have generally managed to perform well against the consensus of earnings forecasts, with around 77% of S&P 500 firms reporting in Q1 considered earnings outperformers. That rate is higher than the normal rate of around 74% recorded in the first three months of a year, with earnings outperformers beating historical trends.\n\nThe main theme of this quarter’s earnings reports has been artificial intelligence, with companies reporting soaring spending on the technology. Not surprisingly, AI-based and adjacent stocks have been the star earnings outperformers.\r\n\r\nWith about 80% of the major names having reported so far, some big companies that are still likely to move the market have yet to update investors on their Q1 financials. Even though the number of firms reporting earnings is declining as the season comes to an unofficial end, there are still some potential earnings outperformers left to deliver strong results despite an already solid market.\n\nNVDIA (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith AI taking center stage during this earnings season, the top performer in the space has yet to report. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a consistent AI earnings outperformer, is set to report its earnings on May 22 amid high expectations about whether its meteoric rise continues and what guidance it will provide.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOther AI companies have provided positive commentary, with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) significantly increasing its orders of Nvidia’s H100 chips that power AI workloads. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also looking to nearly double its use of H100 chips in 2024 as it works to roll out full self-driving cars.\r\n\r\nAnalyst consensus forecasts Nvidia’s revenue growth will slow down from last year’s explosive pace but remain celestial, with EPS projected to rise 34% to $7.64.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has a proven track record of handily beating estimates since the AI boom, followed by a rally in its share price. Will the company deliver over $0.50 in earnings upside for the fourth consecutive quarter and turn Nvidia into another earnings outperformer?​\n\nApogee Therapeutics (APGE) pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factory\n\nSource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelatively small pharmaceutical company Apogee Therapeutics (NASDAQ:APGE) saw its stock jump over 95% after it was one of the earnings outperformers in its most recent release. Its earnings came with positive data on the progress of one of its two investigational candidates for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Atopic Dermatitis.\n\nThe AD candidate completed positive Phase 1 trials just before the earnings report. The company took advantage of the post-earnings stock surge to sell $420 million worth of shares, though the stock price has retreated slightly since.\r\n\r\nWhile the company hasn’t scheduled its next earnings date yet, it historically reports in early June. Investors will then get more details of the company’s financials and pipeline, including an increased cash position of approximately double its $399.5 million cash on hand last time it reported following the share issuance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis provides a fairly comfortable runway to complete ongoing clinical trials as the company works to establish itself as a potential earnings outperformer in the biopharma industry.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company.

JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs investors worried about China’s economic recovery earlier this year, Chinese tech firm JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and other Chinese stocks saw their share price plummet.\n\nHowever, China’s Q1 GDP growth exceeded expectations, and Chinese tech stocks have rebounded, with some still making a recovery. JD.com currently trades at a relatively low price-to-earnings P/E ratio of 15.15, showing a notable gap from its American equivalent, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a P/E ratio of 52.\r\n\r\nJD.com is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on May 16. Analysts estimate forecast earnings of $0.65 per share, slightly below the $0.66 reported in the previous year.\n\nHowever, JD.com has a solid track record of beating analyst estimates and being an earnings outperformer. Given it topped analysts’ EPS estimate of $4.51 per share by 17% at $5.30 in March for the fiscal year 2023, recording a straight 10-year beat, and an attractive valuation, JD.com remains well-positioned as an earnings outperformer for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tech Giants Alphabet And Meta Pay Dividends Now - But Are They Worth It?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nTech behemoths are known for their stellar growth potential, which results in significant capital gains. However, they are typically not popular with investors seeking dividend payouts for steady passive income.\n\nNonetheless, in a significant move reflecting a shift in strategy and a maturing stage of growth, both Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have announced plans to pay dividends to their shareholders alongside massive share buyback programs.\n\nStellar Earnings and First Dividend Payouts\n\nMeta Platforms, formerly Facebook, took the market by storm with its announcement of a quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share for the first time in its history back in February. The social media giant also revealed an expanded $50 billion share buyback program.\n\nThis decision came as Meta reported financials for the last quarter of 2023 exceeded expectations. Revenues amounted to $40.1 billion, surpassing the Wall Street estimate of $39.18 billion. Furthermore, the company's bottom line came in at $5.33, beating the consensus estimate of $4.96.\n\n\"Introducing a dividend just gives us a more balanced capital return program and some added flexibility in how we return capital in the future,\" said Susan Li, Meta Platforms CFO.\n\nSimilarly, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, unveiled its plans to pay its first-ever dividend of $0.20 per share last month, alongside a massive $70 billion share buyback program. This decision followed Alphabet’s impressive first-quarter results, which surpassed analysts’ expectations.\n\nAlphabet's total revenues amounted to $80.54 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, marking the fastest growth since 2022. EPS came in at $1.89, surpassing the consensus analyst estimate of $1.89.\n\nDividends signify a shift in the companies’ approach, from solely focusing on growth to also prioritizing returning value to shareholders.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These three reliable high-yield ETFs will put your income investments on autopilot. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.\n\nMeta's Slowing Growth Projection\n\nMeta Platforms announced its first-quarter earnings results during the last week of April.  However, the market reception of the tech giant's stellar growth was underwhelming. The company's revenues grew 27% year-over-year to $28.65 billion, marking the fastest quarterly growth since 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's projected sales for the second quarter range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of this range, at $37.75 billion, reflects an 18% year-over-year growth rate, falling short of analysts’ average prediction of $38.3 billion.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted initiatives such as advancements in glasses and mixed reality, areas where the company currently lacks profitability. He also emphasized the escalating investments in artificial intelligence. However, this resulted in a steep sell-off, as META stock fell by 16% intraday on April 24.\n\nFor years, investors have been drawn to tech stocks like Meta and Alphabet for their growth potential. While dividends offer a steady income stream, they may not match the exponential growth that these companies have historically provided. Moreover, the tech stalwarts don't have a steady history of paying dividends, which might deter investors who seek reliable quarterly dividend payouts.\n\nCapturing Growth and Income\n\nWhile Meta and Alphabet’s decision to pay dividends is a significant shift in their strategies, it’s important to note that these payouts are unlikely to amount to substantial returns in the form of income for investors. Meta’s forward dividend yield currently stands at a mere 0.11%, while Alphabet’s is only slightly higher at 0.12%. These low yields indicate that both companies are still very much focused on growth rather than providing meaningful income to shareholders.\n\nFor investors who want to capture the growth potential of Meta and Alphabet while also generating steady income, diversifying their portfolios with real estate investments could be an attractive option. Platforms like Arrived offer a unique opportunity to invest in rental properties without the hassle of being a landlord, and the minimum investment is only $100.\n\nBy investing through Arrived, individuals can own shares of carefully selected rental properties in high-growth markets across the United States. This allows investors to benefit from the potential appreciation of the properties while also earning regular rental income. Moreover, Arrived’s team of experts handles all aspects of property management, making it a truly passive investment experience. Click here to view properties available on Arrived.\n\nDiversifying with private market real estate can help investors balance their portfolios, combining the growth potential of tech giants like Meta and Alphabet with the stability and income-generating capabilities of rental properties. This approach can provide a more well-rounded investment strategy, catering to both long-term growth and steady income generation.\n\nWant to explore more private market real estate options?

        "content": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's competition board fined Meta Platforms 1.2 billion lira ($37.20 million) on Wednesday after concluding two separate investigations on data-sharing in its Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads platforms.\n\nThe board launched an investigation into Meta in December over a possible violation of competition law by linking its social media platforms Threads and Instagram. The board in March imposed an interim measure on Meta meant to hinder data sharing between those two platforms.\n\nMeta said last month it would temporarily shut down Threads in Turkey to comply with the interim order.\n\nThe board said on Wednesday it imposed a fine of 898 million lira for the compliance process and the investigations launched into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as an additional 336 million lira fine for a separate investigation into Threads.\n\nUsers will be able to merge personal data between Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp with their own consent and will be notified about data usage, according to the board decision. Users will be able to change their settings later, if needed, using an \"accounts centre\" on the platforms, it said.\n\nIn January, the board also fined Meta $160,000 per day for failing to provide sufficient documentation as part of another previous investigation. It had also imposed a daily fine of 4.8 million lira per day in March over a notification message about data-sharing.\n\nBoth those penalties ended May 3.\n\nIn 2022, the board also decided to fine Meta 346.72 million lira for violating competition law.\n\n($1 = 32.2540 liras)\n\n(Reporting Ebru Tuncay; Writing by Burcu Karakas; Editing by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Michael Erman)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 3 Best Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "A group of large technology companies deemed the \"Magnificent Seven\" has broadly defined investing success over the past decade. If you held any of these stocks, you'd probably be thrilled with your investment returns.\n\nWhile many of the Magnificent Seven stocks are now worth over a trillion dollars and likely won't repeat their same growth over the next 10 years, some can still make you richer over time.\n\nHere are my top three picks of this group to buy and hold indefinitely.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMost everyone knows about e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which dominates online shopping and accounts for 38% of the market in America. Many people may even know that Amazon operates the world's leading cloud platform, AWS, a virtual underpinning of the internet today. Fewer people probably realize that Amazon has become a tremendous advertising company. Its ad business grew 24% year over year in the first quarter and is on pace for $45 billion this year.\n\nNo company in history might be as good as Amazon at finding ways to enter and dominate new markets. How does a company go from selling books online to selling everything to over 200 million Prime subscribers? How does an online bookstore start and beat tech-focused competitors to become the leading cloud platform? Now, investors are beginning to see just how big Amazon's ad business is becoming. It's truly remarkable.\n\nThat's especially so because all of these markets have years of growth ahead. E-commerce is still just 22% of total U.S. retail. Amazon Web Services is still growing well into the double digits; it just rose 17% year over year in Q1, and that's not likely to slow down with artificial intelligence (AI) taking off. Amazon's ad business is now its fastest-growing segment, so it probably still has years of expansion ahead. Buy and hold Amazon. It's boring but consistently delivers.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nEveryone seems to have social media, but Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) continues to grow its user base. Over the past three months, the company racked up another 50 million daily active users across its family of apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. That's now 3.24 billion people logging on each day. Meta makes money (lots of it) by selling digital ads to companies. It's also remarkably lucrative; about $0.35 of every revenue dollar is free cash flow. Meta's trailing-12-month revenue is $142 billion, which shows you how much cash that is.\n\nMeta just started paying a dividend and famously repurchases a ton of stock to help further boost earnings-per-share. That financial engineering alone could make you wealthier over the long term. Investors believe the company's earnings can grow by an average of 19% annually over the next three to five years, so a slowdown doesn't appear in the cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is still just about 40 years old, making him young enough to continue leading the company for decades into the future if he chooses. Zuckerberg has pushed the company to invest billions into AI development, sometimes turning Wall Street off. Still, if these investments prove fruitful, they could cement the growth of the next generation of Meta investors.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), a household name and tech giant, is the oldest of this group by far. The company's roots go back to the modern PC, and it's a testament to the company that its legacy businesses remain influential today. Over the years, management has branched the company into new markets, like cloud computing, gaming, and AI. It's partnered successfully with OpenAI, arguably the most innovative AI developer.\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft's earnings will grow by an average of \"just\" 16% annually over the next three to five years, which is still plenty to do some excellent work for your portfolio. Notably, Microsoft might be the safest stock you can own. It boasts an AAA credit rating, higher than the U.S. government and one of only two public companies with such a strong rating.\n\nMicrosoft is also a well-known dividend growth stock with 22 consecutive increases. The stock's dividend yield is 0.7% today but has grown by an average of 10% annually over the past five years. The payout only takes up 30% of cash flow, so there is plenty of room for future growth. Investors don't have to overthink Microsoft's diverse business. Buy, hold, and reinvest the dividends for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings",
        "content": "Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.\n\nDespite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are once again on investors’ radars.\n\nAnalysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings, noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.\n\nApart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization. And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.\n\nAs a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.\n\nStory continues\n\niShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) iShares by Blackrock sign\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.\n\nTherefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW) stands out as a compelling choice. This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.\n\nSince its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.\n\nAmong its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).\n\nIYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.\n\nRecently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.\n\nInvestors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.\n\nSo far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil had both long and short positions in META stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "If you’re on the hunt for stocks to buy for the next bull market, look no further. Uncovering opportunities is essential in tech and finance to take advantage of the upcoming wave of industry expansion. A fresh bull market is emerging, providing an opportunity to exploit and profit from strong equities poised for considerable returns. These are the top seven companies in several industries, such as technology platforms, financial services, and semiconductors. In the future, they may lead and propel market expansion.\n\nTo begin with, each company offers a different value proposition and growth driver, ranging from semiconductor giants like the first and second ones. These companies demonstrate advances in process leadership and significant revenue development to tech conglomerates like the third one. This company claims a large and engaged user base. Furthermore, businesses such as the fourth and fifth may strategically benefit from the growing need for sophisticated computer solutions in a variety of industries.\n\nFinally, forward-thinking fintech disruptors like the sixth and seventh are the leaders in semiconductor production and market share. They are making noteworthy progress in growing their market share and advancing tech.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy for the Next Bull Market: Intel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) aims to regain process leadership using technologies like Intel 3 in high-volume production. This is a significant turning point since it indicates that advanced semiconductors are now made in the U.S. Intel is advancing the field and may increase its market share. The company may continue to lead the semiconductor manufacturing industry because of its investments in state-of-the-art technologies such as Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) and High Numerical Aperture (NA) EUV.\n\nMoreover, Intel’s partnerships with significant companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Dell (NYSE:DELL), NAVER (OTCPK:NHNCF), and others highlight the company’s strong customer relationships and market reach. Acquiring significant customers for Intel Foundry’s Intel 18A process technology, such as well-known aerospace and defense companies, confirms Intel’s capabilities and supports revenue growth projections.\n\nFurther, Intel’s data center and AI businesses also saw a 5% year-over-year (YOY) improvement. This is propelled by growing Xeon Average Selling Prices (ASPs) and increasing demand from commercial clients. In summary, despite certain challenges in industries such as Altera and Mobileye, Intel’s overall revenue base is robust, offering opportunities for growth across a broad spectrum of product lines.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD’s (NASDAQ:AMD) client segment saw robust revenue growth in Q1 2024, rising a staggering 85% YOY to $1.4 billion. Sales of AMD Ryzen 8000 Series CPUs played a significant role in this evolution. Introducing new Ryzen CPUs, such as the Ryzen Pro 8000 series for corporate PCs, contributed to the segment’s sales growth. Demands from the consumer and commercial sectors were among the many that AMD’s more comprehensive range of Ryzen CPUs met.\n\nMoreover, the client segment saw a reversal with positive operating profitability the previous year, following an operational deficit. Operating income for the sector was $86 million, against a $172 million loss during Q1 2023. Notwithstanding a consecutive decline in revenue, AMD remains optimistic about the growth prospects for the client business.\n\nFinally, the company anticipates higher revenue growth by releasing the next-generation Ryzen CPU and collaborations enabling AI experiences on PC platforms.\n\nStocks to Buy for the Next Bull Market: Meta (META) An image of a lost businessman on an island as a bull underwater; hidden bull market, bull markets\n\nSource: Lightspring / Shutterstock\n\nMeta’s (NASDAQ:META) sizeable and expanding user base is a key element bolstering the company’s expansion potential. Over 3.2 billion people use one or more of Meta’s apps daily, which illustrates Meta’s broad global reach and showcases its ability to reach a sizable audience across a range of geographies and demographics.\n\nMoreover, there is a 7% increase in Family Daily Active People (DAP) from 2022. This further supports Meta’s development trajectory in terms of user engagement. This particular metric, which indicates the number of users who regularly utilize Meta’s app family, is quite significant. Hence, this indicates that Meta has maintained its present user base and attracted new ones, both necessary for a healthy and active user ecology.\n\nFinally, Meta’s fundamental ability to maintain such a large and growing user base is based on the allure of its platforms. These include Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Meta AI. Hence, these apps have become indispensable to users’ daily lives as they satisfy various social, communication, and entertainment demands.\n\nNXP (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite significant challenges, NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) anticipates that demand indicators for all end sectors will progressively improve in H2 2024. Similarly, Q2 2024 sales patterns are expected to indicate potential growth opportunities. While mobile revenue growth is predicted to be in the low 20% range, industrial and Internet of Things YOY growth may be in the high single-digit percent range.\n\nFurther, to ensure optimal working capital and operational efficacy, NXP employs a rigorous inventory management approach. The company closely monitors inventory levels, and distribution inventory is maintained at a precise level of 1.6 months, by estimates. This is much below the long-term target of 2.5 months of inventory EBITDA.\n\nCertainly, limiting inventory in the distribution channel was a conscious choice. Meanwhile, maintaining inventory on the balance sheet exemplifies prudent inventory management strategies. Hence, this approach gives greater flexibility in adapting to changing market demands and lessens the likelihood of accumulating excess inventory.\n\nStocks to Buy for the Next Bull Market: Arm (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm (NASDAQ:ARM) announced a notable increase in licensing income over projections, as $354 million in license revenue was received, an increase of 18% YOY. Strong bookings have resulted from increased investment in AI across several end sectors, raising demand for advanced Arm CPUs. The demand for Arm’s technology indicates that it is a top choice for companies searching for high-performance computing solutions, especially in AI-related applications.\n\nAdditionally, Arm is gaining market share in significant expanding industries like cloud servers and autos. By going into these markets, royalty can find new streams of income. Revenue growth was aided by the resurgence of the broader semiconductor industry, which includes smartphones.\n\nMoreover, royalties are increasing due to the increased use of Armv9 devices. In general, Armv9 goods have royalty rates twice as high as those of equivalent Armv8 products. In Q3 2024, chips using Armv9 technology accounted for about 15% of Arm’s royalty income, up from 10% in Q2 2024. To sum up, this change aligns with Arm’s strategy of finding innovative ways to meet the needs of shifting customers and reflects technological advancements.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, SoFi’s (NASDAQ:SOFI) Financial Services division recorded record net sales of $151 million, an 86% YOY gain propelled by the company’s strong Money, Credit Card, and Investment products. The contribution profit margin for the category was 25%. In contrast, the Technology Platform segment produced a 33% contribution margin and $94 million in net sales, a 21% increase YOY. The category showed diverse growth opportunities and efficient product development.\n\nWhile the lending division’s adjusted net revenue was constant at $325 million YOY, a noticeable shift toward net interest income led to a 64% margin. SoFi significantly rose in deposits, indicating a reduced reliance on external warehouse financing. In the first quarter of 2024, SoFi added 622,000 new members, increasing its membership base to 8.1 million — a startling 44% increase from the previous year. The financial services industry included 93% of the newly added items, suggesting a significant increase in members’ use of a wide range of products.\n\nTSMC (TSM) An image of a bull standing behind a stock graph with an upward trend; growth stocks. stocks to buy for growth\n\nSource: Zeedign.com / Shutterstock\n\nThrough its planned strategic expansion across several domains, TSMC (NYSE:TSM) has proven its commitment to risk mitigation and worldwide diversification. TSMC intends to bolster its global standing and protect itself from geopolitical dangers by establishing production facilities in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. Further, to expand production capacity to meet growing demand, the business plans to build three fabs in Arizona with clean-room facilities twice as large as traditional logical fabs.\n\nApart from mitigating risks, TSMC’s global expansion endeavors to maintain its technological leadership and stimulate customer expansion. The decision to use state-of-the-art nodes — namely, 2- and 3-nanometer technologies — in overseas fabs demonstrates TSMC’s focus on providing its global customer base with state-of-the-art semiconductor solutions.\n\nFinally, TSMC’s breakdown of its capital budget allocation shows how much the business values breakthrough process technologies. Thus, TSMC is dedicated to maintaining its competitive edge and supporting customers in their creative undertakings by allocating between 70 and 80 percent of the capital budget for advanced nodes.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in INTC, AMD, META, SOFI and TSM.

        "title": "Revisiting My 7 Stock Picks From Last Year: How Did I Do?",
        "content": "Accountability is important when it comes to investing. We all tend to remember our winners and ignore the losers. It can create a bias when discussing whether a strategy is worth following. Or whether you should listen to an online pundit.\n\nThere is no end of analysts touting their home runs but glossing over their strikeouts. That’s why I wanted to review seven stock picks I made one year ago in May. Although I strongly advocate a minimum ownership period of three to five years for a stock, with a decade or more (or a lifetime even) being optimal, a one-year review is sufficient to see if we’re at least heading in the right direction.\n\nI covered 12 different companies last May. Though not all were exactly recommendations, I also didn’t say “steer clear” either. For example, in my article “3 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Betting on Big Time,” I noted Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) had a very weak business model but said perhaps the discount the stock was offering at the time (down 50%) might be enough to attract some investors. Not a ringing endorsement but I’ll own that I didn’t say avoid this value trap (I did do that the next month, though, in my article “3 Stocks to Sell as Companies Prepare for Layoffs“).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStock Total Return \r\n% Change vs. S&P 500 Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) 4.2% (21.6%) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) 4.5% (21.3%) Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) 19.4% (6.4%) MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) 25.7% (0.1%) Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) 55.3% 29.5% Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) (4.0%) (29.8%) Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 35.6% 11.5% Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) 10.4% (13.7%) Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) (12.8%) (36.9%) American States Water (NYSE:AWR) (17.0%) (40.7%) PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) 0.8% (24.5%) Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) 13.5% (10.2%)Returns from date of recommendation. Table by author.\n\nMy report card\n\nSo how did I do? Not bad! Of the 12 stocks I discussed, nine generated positive returns and just three had negative returns, a 75% success rate. However, maybe you were still better off buying an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nWhile the average return of my winners was 18.8% compared to my losers negative 11.3% — giving me an average return of 11.3% — the broad market index did much better with a 24.9% average return. A better than two-to-one drubbing. Add the sad trombone sound here.\n\nWhat follows is a look at my four best picks from last year and the three worst. Caveat emptor!\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nIn retrospect, the case for Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) was easy to make. The need for data centers was growing exponentially and the real estate investment trust (REIT) was the biggest owner of data centers in the world with over 300 facilities. Even then it was apparent that artificial intelligence (AI) would be a driving force in their adoption and growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nI quoted DLR CEO Andy Powers as saying, AI “could spawn a wave of adoption and a proliferation of use cases and ultimately drive demand for compute infrastructure at scale.”\n\nThat holds true today. Companies used to keep data close to home, but speed and security necessitate data be dispersed. A hybrid model, where a mix of on-premise and cloud-based storage is optimal, is seen as gaining traction in the very near future. McKinsey & Company forecasts data center demand will grow by a compounded rate of 10% annually until 2030.\n\nAs Digital Realty counts some of the biggest, most important companies as customers, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), it is likely to consume much of that demand.\n\nBank of America (BAC) bank of America stock BAC stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf Buffett is buying, we probably should be too. That was essentially the take away of my endorsement of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). A year ago the Oracle of Omaha had dumped virtually all of his bank stocks after the regional banking crisis. However, there was one that he was buying: Bank of America. He had bought nearly 23 million shares, giving him more than 1 billion shares total.\n\nThe reason to ride Buffett’s coattails was easy. Consumers were fleeing small, less financially stable banks and heading to larger, more mature institutions like BoA. Its assets were at risk in the high interest rate environment we were suffering through, but it was also padding its net interest income from the loans it was making.\n\nI noted the other day interest rates had caused Bank of America’s unrealized losses to balloon to $122.8 billion, but since almost all were in its held-to-maturity portfolio there was no need to move them to the realized column. There was time enough before they matured for the situation to normalize and BoA could perhaps even make a profit from them by the time they were due.\n\nBank of America is a much more financially sound bank than it once was and was worth holding onto.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLatin American e-comerce and fintech leader MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) seems like another easy call when looking back. Because it focused solely on the central and south American markets, it was betting on their economies growing and expanding more than more developed markets.\n\nMercadoLibre was seeing solid growth in gross merchandise volumes and total payment volumes as consumers increasingly became more digitally aware. It has the leading e-commerce platform in the region where growth was soaring by 25% or more and its Mercado Pago fintech platform was seeing a doubling in usage.\n\nI had noted that at first glance the stock might not seem cheap since it traded at 56 times earnings estimates but because profits margins were readily inflating it would grow into the premium. With the stock now up 25% from last year, MercadoLibre stock has done just that: it now trades at 34 times estimates. Expect to see a further narrowing of the gap in the future.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (EPD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas middleman Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is still an easy stock to recommend but one that carries an asterisk. The master limited partnership (MLP) owns and operates an expansive network of pipelines and storage facilities across the country. It has a great business model that ensures it is profitable.\n\nEnterprise Products operates under long-term contracts with its customers that contain take-or-pay clauses. That means customers pay for the capacity of its transmission lines or its storage tanks and whether or not they are actually used, the industry middleman still gets paid. So it doesn’t matter what the price of oil or gas is today, Enterprise Products Partners still gets paid.\n\nThe one wrinkle, of course, is that EPD is structured as an MLP. Because MLPs are required by law to distribute 90% or more of their profits to investors as dividends, they introduce more complicated tax considerations. I’ve noted an investor may not want to own an MLP in a normally tax-deferred individual retirement account because you could end up owing taxes. It might not be an investment for everyone, but it is potentially lucrative for those who can or do buy.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) Hands holding a smartphone with the Genuine Parts (GPC) logo displayed.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOkay, I’ll say it: Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) should be in my win column. The owner of the NAPA Auto Parts chain of retail stores ought to benefit more from the ongoing economic conditions ravaging consumers. Rising inflation and high interest rates have taken a toll on both new and used car sales. While both have come down from record levels, they remain well above historical trends.\n\nThat would bode well for aftermarket auto parts companies like Genuine Parts. Drivers will keep their existing vehicles operating longer to keep from having to buy a new one. So although interest rates kept consumers from financing new car purchases, inflation was also hitting them in the pocketbook. They just curtailed their spending. It’s a situation that is playing out across many industries now as the Federal Reserve’s higher-for-longer policies take their toll.\n\nWhat eases the pain of Genuine Part’s softness is its dividend, which it has increased for over 50 years. The auto parts retailer is a Dividend King whose payout yields 2.5% annually.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs noted above, movie studio Paramount Global was in sorry shape such that even Warren Buffett didn’t like the company. Especially after the company slashed its dividend from 24 cents to 5 cents, a move Buffett called “not good news,” he was resigned to see what transpired with the stock.\n\nShares bounced 27% off their lows in recent weeks as the movie studio negotiates a sale of the company. It’s complicated though, because Shari Redstone owns a controlling interest. Her objectives are not necessarily the same as the rest of the shareholders. She is trying to merge Paramount with Hollywood studio Skydance in an exclusive arrangement but the board said she should have entertained the offer from private equity firm Apollo Global Management, which is working with Sony Pictures to acquire the company.\n\nThere will be more negotiations for the movie and streaming company that does own some valuable assets. And it may come down to Paramount Global eventually becoming someone else’s problem out of the limelight of Wall Street. It won’t be Buffett’s though. He told investors at Berkshire Hathaway‘s (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) annual meeting, “We sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money.”\n\nAmerican States Water (AWR) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.\n\nSource: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com\n\nUtilities such as American States Water (NYSE:AWR) have been particularly hard hit by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies. Because they are heavily regulated and required to maintain, upgrade and repair their facilities, high interest rates inflates their borrowing costs. At the same time, they are subject to the whims of local utility boards in whether they win rate increases.\n\nYet that’s also one of their more attractive aspects too. They are a known quantity with a reliable business model that generates a substantial revenue stream. They use that money to pay handsome dividends to shareholders. American States Water has been among the best, paying a dividend for 87 consecutive years. It has increased the payout for 69 straight years.\n\nUnfortunately, the macroeconomic environment weighs more heavily on its stock price. And because of profligate spending in Washington, inflation is remaining intransigent causing the Fed further delay any hoped-for rate cuts. Inflation is heading in the wrong direction again. Although chairman Jerome Powell says new rate hikes are “unlikely,” that doesn’t mean they are not possible.\n\nIt looked a lot better for AWR when there was talk of three, four, or even six possible rate cuts. Now, cuts seem off the table for most of the year and increases could be back on the table. Expect a period of underperformance for AWR stock to continue, though that long-term mindset I said was appropriate earlier still makes this a stock to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CVX, PPG, XOM, GPC and AWR stock.

        "title": "Meta seeks redemption in 2024 after botching past elections",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nWith the U.S. presidential election less than six months away, and elections also happening in the EU, U.K., India, and many more countries, now is a good time for CEOs to reflect on their company’s relationship to democracy at large. One company that has done so, and seems ready for redemption, is Meta.\n\nMeta has come a long way. Eight years ago, the Trump campaign used improperly obtained Facebook data to build voter profiles for 50 million users, and Russia weaponized Facebook to undermine the integrity of the U.S. elections. The scandals led to Facebook’s darkest hour, and forced its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before Congress.\n\nBut 2024 isn’t 2016. A crucial part of Meta’s response since then has been the creation of an “independent” oversight board. And last week, that group released its key lessons in a historic election year. These are my takeaways:\n\n- A company should think about its principles vis-à-vis democracy and not react only to specific instances. Meta learned this lesson when it blocked former President Donald Trump’s Facebook account after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which was seen as arbitrary. When it reinstated Trump’s account in 2023, Meta did so based on more broadly applicable protocols.\n\n- Almost no company can be entirely apolitical. Some of the most divisive societal issues concern foundational democratic principles—freedom of speech, equality, limits on government interference—written up in constitutions and human rights charters. A company must know where it stands on such values.\n\n- Efforts to interfere with elections often start small or in inexpensive markets. They then move to more expensive markets. Some interference campaigns are subtle, using deep fakes or somewhat credible fake claims. A company must study its weakest points of entry to ensure it’s not a vehicle for such schemes.\n\n- Finally, oversight boards are a good idea for almost any organization. Meta’s self-governing board can be critical of the company, and its supervision ensures Meta is caught off-guard less often by user protest or complaints.\n\nMeta didn’t get it 100% right. One shortcoming of its oversight board is that it still depends on Meta for funding. Over time, that’s bound to lead to problems. But Meta’s approach nevertheless benefits the company—and society—in myriad ways. For Meta, it lowers the likelihood of future PR crises. More broadly, it makes Meta act as a more responsible corporate citizen. That’s in everyone’s interest, and a model to follow.\n\nMore news below.\n\nPeter Vanham\r\npeter.vanham@fortune.com\r\n@petervanham\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy now according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts.\n\nAs companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season. While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term \"AI\" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.\n\nWithin that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a \"trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure\" to transform computing from \"general purpose to accelerated.\"\n\nSince then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:\n\n\"So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.\n\nAnd, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward.\n\nFor Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that \"AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that \"60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) \"deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.\"\n\n\"And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\"\n\nSo, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with. A couple of notable names are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top analyst AI stock picks, we ranked the top 35 holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF by their average analyst share price target upside and selected the top AI stocks.

        "title": "The challenges facing TikTok as it confronts the US in court",
        "content": "TikTok made good on its promise to challenge a new law signed by President Joe Biden that could result in a ban of the video app in the US.\n\nThe company, a subsidiary of Chinese tech giant ByteDance, asked Tuesday for an injunction to block the US government from enforcing the law, calling it \"unconstitutional\" on First Amendment and other grounds.\n\nThe new suit from TikTok alleges that the US law compromises the company's right to protected speech. It also claims the law infringes on the speech rights of its users.\n\nBut the social media giant could find that it is on less-than-solid legal ground, some experts said. The main reason: Its ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance.\n\n\"As a general matter, foreign companies don't have constitutional rights,\" said Jamil Jaffer, director of the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University’s National Security Institute.\n\nYet Wilson Freeman, an attorney for Pacific Legal Foundation, said his initial reaction to TikTok's complaint was that it's a challenge the government must take \"very seriously.\"\n\n\"I’m not surprised they led with the First Amendment claim, as it seems like the strongest of the four claims by far,\" Freeman said.\n\n\"You can never predict with litigation, but I would not be at all surprised for TikTok to win on that claim.\" The TikTok building in Culver City, Calif. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOne potential problem with TikTok's First Amendment strategy is that a court could shoot down the idea that content on the platform qualifies as TikTok’s or ByteDance’s own speech.\n\nIf a court did validate a First Amendment claim, the company would then have to get over yet another hurdle: proving the new law is intended to influence the viewpoints expressed by TikTok — and not its stated purpose of protecting national security and user privacy.\n\nThe company has argued that it is not under Chinese control.\n\n\"ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government. It is a private company,\" TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified to members of Congress in March 2023.\n\nIn its complaint, TikTok confirmed a report from the Wall Street Journal that said a sale or divestiture would require the Chinese government's approval.\n\nIt went on to say that the Chinese government \"has made clear that it would not permit a divestment of the recommendation engine that is a key to the success of TikTok in the US.\"\n\nFree speech rights of TikTok users\n\nA stronger, yet still tenuous, First Amendment claim could come from one of TikTok’s 170 million US users, who may also argue their rights to express viewpoints are being violated.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat argument worked in Montana when a US District Court temporarily blocked enforcement of a state ban on TikTok, siding with the app's American users. A judge acknowledged the state was entitled to regulate some level of speech but said it did so too broadly to withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\nThe new US law passed by Congress may be tailored enough to avoid a similar fate, according to University of New Haven senior economics lecturer and lawyer Brian Marks. A TikTok content creator speaks to reporters outside the US Capitol, Tuesday, April 23, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)\n\n\"I'm not so sure the users' First Amendment argument will necessarily win the day,\" Marks said.\n\nThat’s \"because the users still have access to platforms where they can provide speech\" such as Instagram (META), Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nJaffer agreed that those competing platforms are likely adequate alternatives. The Constitution guarantees the right to speech only in public forums and not in private forums such as those provided by corporations.\n\n\"It would be a significant extension of First Amendment law for the courts to say that people have a right to access or speak on a private forum, particularly one controlled by a foreign company,\" Jaffer said.\n\nEx post facto\n\nAnother still weaker claim, the experts said, is TikTok's assertion in its new suit that the new US law violates the Constitution’s prohibition against bills of attainder, also known as ex post facto laws.\n\nSuch laws deem previously legal activity as illegal and then reach back in time to punish violators for past actions.\n\n\"Several bills of attainder cases have been brought over the years, and none of them have been successful,\" Freeman said. \"I would be very skeptical that [TikTok] would win on a bill of attainder claim, but it's possible.\"\n\nTo withstand such a challenge, the experts said, the government has to show that the law has a nonpunitive purpose.\n\nAccording to Congress, the law’s intent is not to punish TikTok but to protect Americans.\n\n\"So the question is whether or not that’s actually true,\" Freeman said.\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei tried and failed to invalidate a US law on those grounds.\n\nIn a suit against the US government, the company argued that Congress abused its power by authorizing the National Defense Authorization Act, which prohibited the federal government from purchasing Huawei’s telecom equipment and services.\n\nTexas’s federal District Court for the eastern district ruled against Huawei, finding that although the law singled out Huawei, it wasn't punitive because it applied only to future Huawei actions.\n\nHowever, the company did persuade the court that the Constitution’s prohibition against bills of attainder offered protection to US business entities, in addition to US individuals.\n\nThe 'Takings Clause'\n\nThere are other arguments TikTok is making in its new suit that will face a lot of pushback.\n\nOne is that the government violated the Constitution's Takings Clause, which says the government cannot assert ownership over private property without just compensation.\n\nAnother has to do with TikTok's assertion of rights under the Equal Protection Clause, which requires that the nation’s laws be applied equally to US citizens and entities.\n\nFreeman is skeptical about the Takings Clause application.\n\n\"I don’t know that there are takings here,\" Freeman said. \"The government is just banning a particular product.\" A TikTok content creator sits outside the US Capitol on Tuesday in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)\n\nThe counterargument to a claim that the government is violating equal protection, Marks said, is that the US often disadvantages foreign entities in the interest of national security. Tariffs on particular companies and industries are one example, he explained.\n\nUltimately, Marks said, US courts will look for facts that identify Congress's true intention in passing the divestiture law and weigh those objectives against any viable constitutional protections that TikTok or its users raise.\n\n\"That’s the big tent umbrella,\" Marks said. \"And I would question that.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday it was expanding its suite of generative AI ads products to offer tools that can automatically create variations of images and overlay text atop them.\n\nThe tool will launch in test form without the watermarks the social media company is applying to all images generated by its user-facing Meta AI assistant, which it has touted as a key safety feature, executives said at a press conference.\n\nJohn Hegeman, Meta's head of monetization, said the company was still working through how labeling would work for ads and would share guidelines by the time the tool rolls out globally, likely around the end of this year.\n\nThe announcement comes as Meta is pumping billions of dollars into building and supporting its generative AI models, while trying to convince advertisers they can get more bang for their buck by automating the work involved in creative aspects of their campaigns.\n\nFellow digital ads giant Google announced a similar expansion of AI ads tools in February. Google said ads created using its tools would be labeled using the SynthID watermarking technology developed by its AI research lab, DeepMind.\n\nWith Meta's image generation tool, advertisers will be able to upload images of its products and generate other versions of those images, for example by adjusting the products' orientation or showing people using them in different settings.\n\nIt is also expanding its text-generation offerings for headlines and key selling points, while adding the capability to overlay text onto generated images directly.\n\nThe company will add an option in the coming months for advertisers to input text prompts that can be used to tailor the image variations, it said.\n\nAs with earlier generative AI tools, advertisers running campaigns in regulated industries like politics will be barred from using the products.\n\nAdvertisers have rushed to embrace AI ads tools that automate the placement of their campaigns in front of different groups of users, but generally have been more hesitant about newer generative AI tools.\n\nSome brands have expressed reservations about how tech companies will use any images they upload to improve the models, wary that their logos or other intellectual property could wind up in others' generated images.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul, Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. is testing new tools that will let advertisers create marketing material, including images and messaging, using generative AI prompts.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial Israel Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short One Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire Einhorn Says Markets Are ‘Broken.’ Here’s What Data Shows\n\nIf an advertiser uploads a photo of their product, Meta’s artificial intelligence tools can now generate new, different images of that product for marketing purposes. That feature is already live for some advertisers. In the coming months, marketers will also be able to use text prompts to create different versions of the original image, the company said Tuesday.\n\nMeta’s AI tools can also generate text for advertisements, including headlines and primary ad copy. “We are currently testing the ability for the generated text to reflect your brand’s voice and tone, by highlighting key selling points based on your previous campaigns and text input,” Meta wrote in a blog post explaining the new tools.\n\nMeta advertisers can already use generative AI to change the background of an image that they upload to the system, but Tuesday’s announcement expands those capabilities as part of the company’s broader push into the technology. Eventually, Meta hopes to let advertisers create brand new marketing images using only a text prompt and without the need for an original image.\n\nMeta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has made AI a major selling point for the company’s business in recent years, a focus that has helped drive the stock price up. The company is using AI advancements to power its recommendation algorithms that determine what posts people see in their social network feeds, and has also created an AI-powered chatbot that exists in several of the company’s apps.\n\nThe advertiser updates come just a few weeks after Meta’s first-quarter earnings report, during which the company surprised investors by announcing it was increasing its annual budget for capital expenditures, including AI-related technologies.\n\nThe vast majority of the company’s advertisers are small- and medium-sized businesses that tend to have smaller budgets for creating a professional marketing campaign. In theory, those companies could eventually use Meta’s generative AI tools to create promotional texts and images for free, cutting down on costs.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing Chris Dixon’s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto’s Grifty Reputation\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Best AI Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Given the rapid rise in AI relevancy, many have argued that AI stocks are currently in a bubble similar to the Dot-Com bubble in the 2000s. However, the main difference between the two eras is that most dot-com companies weren’t actually producing any real products or services. On the other hand, AI stocks have legitimate revenue-driving products. And, they have the ability to boost the productivity and efficiency of other strong existing businesses.\n\nSo are all AI stocks worth buying right now? Definitely not. In a bubble-like environment, many stocks will be overvalued. Currently, AI is the tide that is raising all boats.\n\nLet’s examine the three best AI stocks to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META)  In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is an American technology company that was founded by its current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg. It’ best known for apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, which have over 3.2 billion daily active users. In April, 55 of the 62 analyst recommendations were a buy or strong buy rating for the stock. The average price target is $480.13 with a street-high target of $552.50.\n\nAt the center of Meta’s AI research is its Llama 3 large language model. This is Meta’s answer to OpenAI’s GPT and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Gemini platform. The main difference is that Llama 3 is completely open-source and free for both commercial and personal users. As META moves to integrate its intelligent assistant into many of its products, investors should expect Meta’s market dominance to continue.\n\nAs for its financials, although Meta had a quick meltdown after its recent earnings, its recovery has swiftly been going underway. Shares are trading at a reasonable 8.3x sales and 22.8x forward earnings. Revenue-wise, Meta’s ten-year revenue CAGR of 32% puts it an edge above its peers like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nFounded in 2012, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is an American cloud-computing company. The stock held its IPO in September 2020 in what was one of the most anticipated debuts in Wall Street history. Even still, Snowflake has a ton of potential upside with a street-high price target of $600.00. Its average target of $219.71 represents a nearly 40% upside from its current price.\n\nSo how is Snowflake an AI stock? Snowflake’s data warehousing and analytics platform is essential to building AI solutions for specific companies and businesses. Think of it as a pick-and-shovel play for AI rather than a business that directly develops AI technology. Also, SNOW has become well known for its large language model called “Arctic”. It helps deliver enterprise solutions like coding and development with breakthrough efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, its stock has seen a sell-off resulting from a combination of a weak forecast and overall uncertainty surrounding its sudden change in CEO. At these depressed prices, shares are now trading at 18.6x sales, a historically cheap point for SNOW. Assuming a reversion to the mean, now is a great opportunity to take advantage of the recent negative sentiment around Snowflake.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is an American data analytics firm that was founded in 2003 and specializes in empowering enterprises with its big data analytics. Wall Street analysts have a wide range of price targets for PLTR. These targets range from as low as $5.00 to as high as $35.00 with an average price target of $23.33.\n\nThis company is well known for its enterprise software platforms that help to digest and analyze large sets of data. Palantir recently partnered with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to provide AI solutions to both commercial and government clients. Moreover, CEO Alex Karp recently stated that demand for its AIP AI-based platform has been unprecedented. PLTR’s commitment to signing new contracts has helped it establish itself as an emerging leader in the AI data analytics sector. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Palantir’s valuation has always been the bear thesis for the stock. Even with the recent growth, shares trade at 24x sales and 75x forward earnings. Nonetheless, Palantir has finally become profitable and has seen a sharply rising revenue CAGR over the past three years. So, with its emergence as a major AI player, Palantir could be on the verge of a hyper-growth phase in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments.\n\nTom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented:\n\n“A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.”\n\nCurrently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the \"size effect\". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs.\n\nSome of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of May 3, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\nA close-up image of a stock market graph displaying the growth of the company's mutual funds.\n\nBest Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\n12. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 69.29%\n\nFirst Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) aims to mirror the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Growth Index. It seeks to achieve similar investment outcomes in terms of both price and yield, excluding fees and expenses. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)’s net expense ratio stands at 0.60% as of December 1, 2023. As of May 2, 2024, the fund’s net assets exceed $1 billion, and its portfolio comprises 187 holdings, excluding cash. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to monitor.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is one of the top holdings of First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC). According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds held stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with a stake worth $1.88 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a popular stock among elite hedge funds.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top Q1 contributors were Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), Shockwave Medical and Spotify. Chipotle’s combination of superior quality and speed of service has created a strong brand affinity, and the company is currently expanding its store count at a growth rate of 8%–10% annually. With each restaurant generating an annual income of around 60% of its original investment cost, the implied payback period is less than two years. Given these attractive economics, we believe a long runway remains for market penetration potential. Next, increased accessibility and convenience have been a strategic priority, leading it to add secondary “make lines” that enable each store to meet increased demand from third-party delivery services and the company’s own digital pickup lanes (“Chipotlanes”). And last, evidence is emerging that the company’s post-COVID training initiatives (“the four pillars of throughput”) are resulting in higher peak-time productivity. Overall, the profit cycle remains nicely in motion, and the stock remains a large CropSM holding.”\n\n11. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 81.23%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 11th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) aims to replicate the performance of S&P 900 Growth Index, which consists of large and mid-cap US stocks known for their growth potential. This ETF focuses on companies expected to experience earnings growth exceeding the market average. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)’s net assets amounted to $16.5 billion as of May 2, 2024. The fund features a portfolio comprising 473 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.04%.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) occupies the largest position in iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)’s portfolio. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was found in 302 hedge fund portfolios, with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust holding the biggest stake in the company, comprising 38.2 million shares worth $14.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds best-in-class platforms and provides services that help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft’s stock appreciated based on excitement surrounding the company’s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI, which will be through both Azure and Microsoft Copilot, the company’s new GenAI personal assistant.”\n\n10. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 82.91%\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is placed 10th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) seeks to replicate the performance of S&P 500(R) Growth Index, which is composed of large-cap US stocks known for their growth potential. The ETF was launched on May 22, 2000. Its net assets amounted to $42.8 billion as of May 2, 2024. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)’s portfolio comprises 228 holdings, along with an expense ratio of 0.18%.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd in the portfolio of iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW). Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database reveals that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of 131 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 134 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.56 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a global consumer electronics and software company that designs and markets mobile communications devices (iPhones), personal computers (Macs), multi-purpose tablets (iPads), and wearables (Apple Watch, AirPods, and Accessories). The company also sells several high-margin consumer services including Advertising, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content and Payment Services. The stock’s underperformance during the quarter was due to fears that the company’s slowing top-line growth and increased competitive threats make the stock’s premium valuation harder to justify.”\n\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 83.73%\n\nVanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) invests in stocks from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Growth Index. Its primary objective is to closely mirror the returns of this index, which is considered a benchmark for overall US growth stock performance. The ETF was established on September 7, 2010. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) features an expense ratio of 0.10% and its portfolio comprises 228 stocks. As of March 31, 2024, VOOG’s net assets came in at $10.3 billion.\n\nSemiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top holdings of Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG). As per Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was found in 173 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 180 in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is one of the largest stakeholders of NVIDIA, with 13.90 million shares worth $6.88 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\n8. iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 92.31%\n\niShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG) seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Growth Index, consisting of US equities with growth traits from both large and mid-cap categories. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. As of May 2, 2024, iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s net assets came exceeded $2 billion. The fund features an expense ratio of 0.04% and a portfolio comprising 392 holdings.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 4th in iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s portfolio. Insider Monkey’s Q4 database found that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was held by 293 smart hedge funds, up from 286 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 41.78 million shares worth $6.34 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.”\n\n7. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 94.88%\n\nFidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) strives to mirror the price and yield performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a weighted index reflecting the market capitalization of stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

(NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\n6. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 100.46%\n\nNuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) ranks 6th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) follows a passive management strategy, investing primarily in large-cap US equity securities displaying growth characteristics and meeting required environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards.

(NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top growth plays on the radar of smart investors.\n\nPalm Valley Capital Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Governments have various irons in the fire for curbing (commandeering?) the power of tech titans, with the European Union rolling out the Digital Markets Act, the Federal Trade Commission suing Amazon for illegally using monopoly power, and the DOJ lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s advertising business going to trial in September.\n\nFurthermore, the dominant technology enterprises are not immune from shooting themselves in the foot. Google’s botched launch of its AI model, Gemini, shows the risk of having too much money. You lose discipline. A Pirate Wires exposé into the firm’s culture revealed that employees went to extreme lengths to intentionally degrade the quality of the AI engine’s output for ideological reasons. Try that as a small business!

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg\n\nFacebook’s “supreme court” is investigating the social media giant for allowing users to post the controversial pro-Palestinian slogan “from the river to the sea”.\n\nThe company’s Oversight Board, a panel of academics and campaigners who review moderation policies, said it would consider three posts where parent company Meta left the phrase online after appeals from users.\n\nHate speech campaigners have condemned chants of “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as anti-Semitic and genocidal, arguing the words imply the destruction of the state of Israel and are used as a rallying cry by terror groups including Hamas.\n\nAs I said earlier this week, “decolonization”, “from the river to the sea” and similar euphemisms necessarily imply genocide.\r\n\r\nClear calls for extreme violence are against our terms of service and will result in suspension. https://t.co/1fCFo5Lezb\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 17, 2023\n\nThe board – whose members include ex-Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former prime minister of Denmark – will look at three posts that were viewed millions of times between them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll three posts were reported by multiple users and allowed to remain online by Meta. One post condemned “senseless slaughter” by “Zionist Israeli occupiers”.\n\nThe panel said it had picked the cases to determine how Meta should moderate the phrase “given the resurgence in its use after October 7, 2023, and the controversies surrounding the phrase’s meaning”. The board’s decisions are non-binding.\n\nMeta told the board that the specific posts were not found to have violated its rules against violence, hate speech or support for dangerous groups.\n\nThe company said use of the slogan had already been reviewed, and that it was not necessarily a call for violence or linked exclusively to support for Hamas.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January, the Oversight Board warned that Facebook and Instagram, which is also owned by Meta, were failing to remove Holocaust denial posts. One post, which questioned whether six million Jews had been killed by the Nazis, remained up for three years.\n\nIt said anti-Semites had been able to evade Meta’s detection tools using images, memes or code words and that Meta was overly reliant on automated systems to review posts.\n\nIn December, The Telegraph revealed that Meta had allowed adverts to be purchased on its social networks that included the phrase “from the river to the sea”. The company said at the time that the phrase could be blocked if it violated its policies.\n\nA Meta spokesman said: “We welcome the board’s review of our guidance in this matter. While all of our policies are developed with safety in mind, we know they come with global challenges and we regularly seek input from experts outside Meta, including the Oversight Board.\n\n“As we’ve said previously, we continually assess our policy guidance to better understand potential impacts on different communities. This work is ongoing, and we look forward to the board’s decision and recommendations.”",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Buy These 2 Hypergrowth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Roughly three decades ago, the advent of the internet completely changed the growth arc for corporate America. Since then, countless next-big-thing investments have come and gone with moderate success. However, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) may be the first game-changing innovation that gives the advent of the internet a run for its money.\n\nWith AI and machine learning, software and systems are able to learn and evolve without human intervention. The ability to become more proficient at their tasks, as well as learn new tasks, gives AI systems utility in most sectors and industries. It's the likely catalyst behind PwC's otherworldly estimate that AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDespite this eye-popping figure, history tells us that not every company will benefit from a next-big-thing innovation. Although Wall Street and investors are absolutely enamored with semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), two hypergrowth AI stocks look like considerably smarter buys right now.\n\nThe infrastructure foundation of the AI movement may be in a massive bubble\n\nOn the surface, it's easy to see why investors have flocked to Nvidia since 2023 began. Last year, the company's Data Center segment sales surged 217% to $47.5 billion, with its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) leading the charge. In particular, Nvidia's H100 chips are the preferred choice of businesses wanting to train large language models and run generative AI solutions.\n\nNvidia has also benefited from AI-GPU scarcity. Whereas Nvidia recorded 126% net sales growth across all segments in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), its cost of revenue rose by only 43%. This is a pretty clear indication that phenomenal pricing power for its in-demand GPUs drove the bulk of this sales growth.\n\nBut don't expect this superior pricing power to last much longer. As the company increases its own production of A100 and H100 chips, and new entrants enter the AI-accelerated data center space, high-powered GPU scarcity is going to decline. Nvidia's pricing power will probably weaken in the quarters to come.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia is unlikely to see successively larger orders from members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" after this year. Its top four customers make up around 40% of its net revenue, and they're all developing their own GPUs. Over time, this should lessen the reliance of the Magnificent Seven stocks on Nvidia's infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the biggest concern of all might just be that every next-big-thing trend and innovation dating back 30 years has navigated its way through an early innings bubble. Professional and everyday investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption and uptake of new innovations. It's highly unlikely that AI is going to be the exception, and arguably no company is more directly exposed to a bubble-bursting event than Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead of going against history, the following two supercharged AI growth stocks look like genius buys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first high-octane AI stock that makes for a considerably smarter buy than Nvidia is social media colossus Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta happens to be one of Nvidia's \"top four customers\" I alluded to earlier that's developing its own AI chips.\n\nAside from developing in-house AI-GPUs, Meta is deploying generative AI solutions in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most notable is as a tool to help advertisers tailor their message(s) to individual users.\n\nIf the AI bubble were to burst, Meta would be able to navigate the storm with minimal risk to its operating performance. That's because almost 98% of the company's revenue can be traced to advertising. In other words, all that really matters to Meta's near-term operating results is how healthy the U.S. and global economy are.\n\nThough there are select predictive indicators and money-based metrics that suggest the U.S. economy could fall into a recession in the not-too-distant future, history shows that periods of growth last significantly longer than downturns. For patient investors, the ad-driven model that Meta offers continues to pay off.\n\nMeta owns a number of the most-visited social sites globally, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Facebook Messenger. Collectively, its family of apps helped lure 3.24 billion daily active users to its platforms in the March-ended quarter, and close to 4 billion monthly active users as of the end of December. This makes it the clear go-to for advertisers, which should support substantial ad-pricing power over the long run.\n\nAnother reason investors can confidently buy Meta stock is its pristine balance sheet. Meta closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated more than $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations. It has more than enough capital to continue to tackle its metaverse and AI ambitions without adversely impacting its foundational advertising cash cow.\n\nMeta is currently valued at just 12 times consensus cash flow estimates for 2025, which represents an 18% discount to its trailing-five-year average multiple to cash flow.\n\nSentinelOne\n\nA second hypergrowth artificial intelligence stock that investors can confidently buy instead of Nvidia is endpoint cybersecurity solutions provider SentinelOne(NYSE: S).\n\nSentinelOne's security platform, known as Singularity, relies on AI and machine learning to become more efficient at autonomously recognizing and responding to potential threats across all system processes.\n\nOne of the many beauties of cybersecurity is that it's no longer an optional service. Businesses of any size that have an online or cloud-based presence need to protect their data from robots and hackers that don't take time off. Increasingly, the onus of this protection is falling to third-party providers, like SentinelOne.\n\nThough Wall Street was less than thrilled with SentinelOne's full-year sales guidance of $812 million to $818 million -- the consensus forecast was for $818 million -- when it was issued in March, the midpoint of the company's guidance still implies 31% year-over-year growth. There's a real possibility this company could catapult from a reported $621 million in sales in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31, 2024) to north of $2 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029.\n\nAside from growing at a lightning-quick pace, SentinelOne is benefiting from its subscription-driven operating model. As of the end of fiscal 2024, its annualized recurring revenue (ARR) jumped by 39% to $724.4 million. Subscriptions provide the company with predictable cash flow, which has led to a juicy adjusted gross margin that's closing in on 80%. Recurring profitability shouldn't be too far off.\n\nFurthermore, SentinelOne is landing bigger fish. The number of customers generating at least $100,000 in ARR for the company jumped 30% to 1,133 last year, with a dollar-based net retention rate of 115% among these clients. In short, its larger customers are spending an average of 15% more from the previous year.\n\nOnce SentinelOne reaches recurring profitability, the sky could be the limit for its share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Pinterest is standing out from the crowd by using AI to create positive experiences for users, says its CEO.\n\n“We’re trying to prove that you can use AI for good,” CEO Bill Ready said to Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills on Monday.\n\n“We've really invested in making Pinterest a more positive alternative to traditional social media,\" he added. \"And when you ask Gen Z, they will tell you that they see Pinterest as an oasis away from the toxicity that they see on much of the rest of social media.”\n\nThe social media company has been incorporating a suite of \"inclusive AI\" technologies into its platform that help make search results more representative of different body types and skin tones.\n\nThough the potential TikTok ban has been making headlines, Ready said, “We're not sitting back hoping for the demise of other platforms.”\n\nPinterest was founded in 2008 as a visual discovery platform where users can search and save ideas. Over the years, the company has evolved into offering users shoppable content.\n\n“Pinterest is where Gen Z goes to shop,” said Ready about the platform's largest demographic. “Over the last two years, we've really been opening the stores, making it really easy for users to connect to the things that they find on Pinterest.”\n\nPinterest reported massive first quarter earnings last week, beating analyst estimates on almost every metric. Revenue jumped 23% year over year, its best growth in three years. Global monthly active users increased to 518 million, an all-time high and a 12% jump from last year.\n\nThe company cut its losses to $24.8 million this quarter, compared to $208.6 million last year. The stock is up over 90% in the past year.\n\nPinterest has also been investing heavily in its advertising business, striking partnerships with Google and Amazon. \"When you step back from it all, Pinterest is firing on all cylinders,\" Ready said.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 states with the highest and lowest resignation rates. We have also discussed the state of jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates.\n\nThe state of US jobs in recent times has been nothing less than a paradox as the headline job numbers seem to be strong but Americans are struggling to secure jobs. Despite the addition of 275,000 jobs in February 2024 alone, the labor market has become increasingly competitive, with companies exercising caution in hiring given the economic uncertainty.\n\nThe hiring slowdown can be attributed to various factors, including companies being wary of high interest rates and wages, leading to a more selective hiring process. As a result, the job market has become more challenging for both recent graduates and seasoned professionals alike. Speaking of hiring, see industries hiring rightnow in 2024.\n\nIt is also true that the current job market is plagued by a mismatch between job openings and the skills and qualifications of job seekers. Despite there being 8.9 million job openings in January, down from a peak of 12 million in March 2022, many positions remain unfilled, while workers struggle to secure employment that matches their qualifications.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in Monster's “New Year, New Career” 2024 report, 95% of surveyed US workers expressed intent to seek new job opportunities. Despite the widespread desire for change, Monster's findings reveal a cautious sentiment among workers as 68% individuals believe that it will be challenging to secure new employment due to economic conditions.\n\nMoreover, employers are faced with mounting pressure to address employee concerns, as indicated by Deloitte's Q4 2023 CFO Survey, which highlights the growing importance of competitive compensation and transparent communication to retain talent. With 45% of workers citing the need for higher income and 64% anticipating salary adjustments to counter inflation, businesses are urged to adapt their strategies to navigate evolving workforce dynamics effectively.\n\nIt must be noted that in 2024, leisure and hospitality is the industry with the highest resignation rate in the US. On the other hand, information is one of the industries with the lowest turnover rates.\n\nApart from the resignation rates, there are also concerns about layoffs. For example, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s recent decision to reduce its workforce in marketing and communications has sparked concern, with reports indicating a major impact on staffing levels. In a brief meeting led by International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s Chief Communications Officer Jonathan Adashek, employees were informed of the impending job cuts, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future direction.\n\nStory continues\n\nThroughout the tech industry, job cuts have become increasingly common, with over 200 companies announcing layoffs, affecting nearly 50,000 positions so far this year. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s restructuring efforts align with its strategy to adapt to evolving market demands, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence. Despite recent growth, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) continues to face challenges in monetizing its AI offerings, facing stiff competition from industry giants like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nOn the other hand, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has adopted a strategy of prudent hiring. In 2023, the company reduced its headcount by 22%, down to 67,317, as part of cost-cutting measures amid challenges in the digital ad market. Despite this reduction, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s performance has been impressive, with fourth-quarter sales growing by 25% to $40.1 billion, and net income increased by 201% to $14 billion. The company's operating margin more than doubled to 41%, showcasing its ability to grow while cutting costs.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) plans to maintain this lean approach to hiring, focusing on high-paying technical roles rather than hyper growth. The company intends to prioritize investments in infrastructure, particularly in artificial intelligence, with total expenses expected to range between $94 billion to $99 billion. Zuckerberg aims to keep Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) culturally aligned with this lean strategy even beyond 2024, reflecting a long-term commitment to efficiency and stability. 25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates\n\nPhotographee.eu/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the states with the highest and lowest resignation rates, we relied on Selectsoftware’s data on quit rates by state collected from July 2023 to October 2023. The list is presented in descending order of resignation rates.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n25. Alaska\n\nResignation Rate: 3.55%\n\nAlaska ranks 2th on our list. With 3.55% resignation rate, Alaska is the state with the highest turnover rate in the US.\n\n24. Montana\n\nResignation Rate: 3.30%\n\nMontana faces challenges in employment owing to its sparse population, limited diversity of industries, and geographical isolation. The state's economy heavily relies on agriculture, tourism, and natural resource extraction, which may not offer as many job opportunities as more diversified economies.\n\n23. Louisiana\n\nResignation Rate: 3.28%\n\nLouisiana is facing on of the highest resignation rates primarily due to the staggering economic impact of insufficient childcare. The annual loss of $1.1 billion in productivity, coupled with a $84 million shortfall in tax revenue, sheds light on the severity of the issue. Women and single parents are disproportionately affected and represent 14.6% and 11.1% respectively of those forced to quit jobs due to childcare problems. Additionally, with 50% of households relying on family members for childcare, the burden falls heavily on informal support networks.\n\n22. West Virginia\n\nResignation Rate: 3.28%\n\nWest Virginia faces challenges in its labor market due to factors like limited job opportunities, low wages, and inadequate workers' rights protections. The state's heavy reliance on industries like coal mining has led to economic instability, while high rates of poverty and limited access to education exacerbate the problem.\n\n21. Wyoming\n\nResignation Rate: 3.25%\n\nWyoming has consistently held the ignominious title of being the deadliest state for workers, with workplace fatalities per 100,000 workers reaching 13 in 2020, surpassing the second-worst state by a significant margin. Despite a 23% improvement in the per-capita fatality rate in 2021, Wyoming still ranked worst in the nation. The state's workplace safety track record remains dismal, with incidents ranging from falls and machinery accidents to fatal road incidents and even ice-related tragedies. Worker advocates highlight the urgent need for action, pointing to policies lacking in protection for employees and an attitude that dismisses safety concerns.\n\n20. Delaware\n\nResignation Rate: 3.20%\n\nThe proximity of Delaware to major metropolitan areas like Philadelphia and New York City provides residents with abundant job opportunities, making it easier for them to find new employment, if dissatisfied. Additionally, Delaware's economy is heavily influenced by industries like finance, healthcare, and technology, which often experience higher turnover rates due to competitive job markets and evolving job roles.\n\n19. Mississippi\n\nResignation Rate: 3.15%\n\nMississippi's high resignation rate stems from multifaceted challenges. Despite offering the nation's lowest cost of living, worker migration remains low due to a workforce lacking in education and productivity. With only 3% employed in STEM fields and 23% holding bachelor's degrees, the state struggles to meet the demands of modern industries. Additionally, its unfriendly business environment, coupled with discriminatory laws, further deter skilled professionals.\n\n18. South Carolina\n\nResignation Rate: 3.10%\n\nThe state has chosen not to adopt more generous labor policies compared to the national standards, such as keeping the minimum wage at the federal level and prohibiting local governments from setting higher minimum wages. Additionally, the absence of mandated paid sick and parental leave further exacerbates workers' challenges. The presence of right-to-work laws weakens unions, impacting workers' collective bargaining power. Historical racial dynamics also play a role, with states like North Carolina implementing less generous labor policies.\n\nIt is also one of the States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.\n\n17. Idaho\n\nResignation Rate: 3.00%\n\nIdaho ranks poorly for work due to several factors. Firstly, it scores 41st in the country for wage policies, mainly because of its low minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which hasn't changed since 2009. Additionally, Idaho's tipped wage is also low at $3.35 per hour. Secondly, its worker protections rank 27th, lacking mandates for equal pay, paid sick leave, and protections against pay secrecy and shift scheduling changes.\n\n16. Tennessee\n\nResignation Rate: 3.00%\n\nThe state of Tennessee is experiencing a shift in its employment landscape as the turnover increase abates. Job openings have declined, particularly in industries like technology and banking, prompting a stabilization in hiring practices. While layoffs are occurring among major corporations, small businesses continue to modestly expand their workforce.\n\n15. Kentucky\n\nResignation Rate: 2.88%\n\nIn Kentucky, there's a pressing need for police officers, with hundreds of positions remaining unfilled across the state. Covington Capt. Jonathan Colwell highlights the challenges, citing diminishing incentives such as less appealing retirement packages. Ft. Wright Mayor Dave Hatter echoes this sentiment, attributing recruitment difficulties to changes in the pension system over the years.\n\n14. Arizona\n\nResignation Rate: 2.85%\n\nFollowing an increase tied to the pandemic, Arizona's resignations are returning to normal. The state's trajectory aligns with the national trend during \"The Great Resignation,\" where job seekers benefited from increased hiring incentives. November saw Arizona's resignation rate drop to 2.7 from 3.0 a year prior.\n\n13. New Mexico\n\nResignation Rate: 2.53%\n\nNew Mexico's resignations show a moderate rate owing to its economic stability, job opportunities, and workplace satisfaction. Unlike states with high turnover, New Mexico offers a relatively favorable environment for retention, supported by effective policies, a balanced economy, and a manageable cost of living.\n\n12. Michigan\n\nResignation Rate: 2.08%\n\nMichigan has one of the lowest resignation rates in the US, with a diverse economic landscape contributing to its stability. According to BLS, in 2017, the state housed 3,859,949 employees across 222,553 establishments. Its Q1 2023 gross state product reached $645.293 billion, ranking 14th nationally.\n\n11. Illinois\n\nResignation Rate: 1.98%\n\nWith a strategic focus on business development and economic growth, Illinois has tripled incentivized private investments to nearly $3 billion since 2022, creating thousands of new jobs. Its advantageous location, modern infrastructure, and strong transportation networks make it a prime destination for companies seeking to expand.\n\nClick here to see the 10 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates 15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024 25 Countries with the Highest Employment Rates in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 AI Stocks You Can’t Afford to Miss for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The recent market correction paves the way for exploring compelling opportunities for investors looking for AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe stock market has slipped into correction territory, with key indexes shedding significant value. This slump follows record highs for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks last year, which were driven by a small group of powerful businesses from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs we chart new waters, the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates would remain high for longer due to ongoing inflation in the world’s largest economy. This approach has no immediate plans for a decrease, which adds to investors’ uncertainty.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, investors now want more than just inflated growth metrics. They demand tangible results that benefit both the top and bottom lines. However, we are still in the early stages, so now is an excellent opportunity to stock up on these three AI stocks.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a digital behemoth that revolutionized social media and owns platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. Additionally, it is a pioneer in the AI revolution, constantly developing to incorporate cutting-edge AI technologies that boost user engagement.\n\nMoreover, Meta is taking things to the next level by building on OpenAI’s ChatGPT initiative. New products like Llama 3 and the addition of real-time image generators to WhatsApp demonstrate this commitment to generative AI. With these developments, Meta is all set to take on its competitors head-to-head and become a significant force in the AI realm.\n\nFurthermore, Meta started off the year with a banger in the first quarter. Its revenue bumped around 27% year-over-year (YOY) to a mind-boggling $36.46 billion, beating estimates by $240 million. Likewise, its earnings-per-share (EPS) clocked in at $4.71, slashing analyst expectations by 39 cents. Despite these fantastic results, we witnessed a dip in the company’s shares after it provided a cautious outlook. Nevertheless, this presents a lucrative chance to buy the stock and maximize long-term profits.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ: SOUN) is at the forefront of interactive AI, a sector expected to grow rapidly. The company uses AI to provide contemporary text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities, enabling real-time translation and applications. This expertise broadens its customer base to restaurants, automobiles, and support centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) announcement on the ownership position in SOUN catapulted the stock to the top charts. However, NVDA’s plan to sell up to 150 million shares was not well received and resulted in over 10% drop in SOUN’s stock price last month. Yet, TipRanks analysts are optimistic and see a stellar 59% upside potential.\n\nThis upside potential is stoked by the SOUN’s bright future growth prospects. The company has projected revenue for the fiscal year 2024 between $63 million and $77 million, which is greater than the $69.73 million average analyst estimate.\n\nLastly, with a 112% price upswing this year and trading approximately 50% below its peak of $10.25, a considerable horizon lies ahead for this small stock.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: UiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) specializes in robotics process automation (RPA), a niche that harnesses software robots and AI to streamline routine tasks. As businesses increasingly emphasize cutting costs and increasing productivity, robust automation solutions will become essential. Since PATH is regarded as the best RPA tool available, these developments will benefit it greatly.\n\nBuilding on this trend, UiPath has included Watsonx.ai capabilities into its platform in partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM), giving users access to core AI models. The claim is that more than 1,500 businesses use UiPath Autopilot, resulting in consistent weekly production and expression.\n\nThis technological leap has propelled UiPath’s impressive financial growth. In Q4, the company notched a revenue of $405.25 million, up 31.4% YOY and surpassing estimates by $21.56 million.\n\nLooking ahead, UiPath anticipates generating $330 million to $335 million in revenue for Q1 of the 2025 fiscal year instead of the analysts’ projected $338 million. If we add the 40% upside potential assigned by TipRanks analysts, UiPath shines as a prime choice among AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNabeel Bukhari is a seasoned research analyst and keen investor.

        "title": "Cathie Wood’s Latest Buys: 3 Stocks the ARK Invest CEO Can’t Get Enough Of",
        "content": "Betting big on the future is not easy. Investing guru Cathie Wood attempts to discern the big ideas that will shape tomorrow and acts on them by buying large tranches of stock for her Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIt requires having a stoic constitution because it means being willing to endure extended periods of underperformance until the stock market catches up with your vision. So far in 2024, most of Wood’s ETFs are losing to the S&P 500 by a wide margin. It doesn’t necessarily mean Wood is wrong; she could be early.\n\nThe money manager shares her every trade in a rare bit of transparency on Wall Street. Below are three Cathie Wood stock picks she sees as the big winners for tomorrow.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo one is surprised Wood continues to buy Tesla’s stock (NASDAQ:TSLA). Few money managers have been more bullish about the electric vehicle (EV) stock than Wood, who famously has a $3,000 per share price target on the stock that still maintains.\n\nIt’s not that Wood expects Tesla to hit that target tomorrow or even this year. It’s a few years into the future, though it still seems hard to see how the EV stock will achieve it.\n\nTesla stock is down 28% in 2024 as the EV market cools. However, it bounced recently from the news of a new lower-cost EV coming to market — the weight of an industry about to go into decline pressures any hope for a stock turnaround.\n\nU.S. EV sales only grew 2.6% in the first quarter and were sharply lower (15.2%) compared to the fourth quarter. It suggests 2024 could be the first time fewer EVs were sold than the year before. Tesla faces growing competition, particularly in China so that more companies may be chasing fewer customers. As one of the few profitable EV companies, Tesla will be one of the last men standing, but it will be a difficult road to the kind of appreciation Wood foresees. The EV stock is the biggest holding in her portfolios, accounting for almost 9% of the total.\n\n10X Genomics (TXG) 10x Genomics headquarters campus in Silicon Valley. TXG Stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nWood has been a big buyer of gene sequencing equipment maker 10X Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG). As the life sciences technology company’s stock has fallen in value, Wood has been scooping up shares. The stock has lost half its value so far this year.\n\n10X Genomics is one of those positions Wood believes will be huge in the future. She sees gene therapy as one of those areas with huge potential. It is featured prominently in her Big Ideas 2024 paper, which outlines the sectors that should drive the future. The company’s ​​equipment for single-cell and spatial biology helps researchers “understand biological systems at a resolution and scale that matches the complexity of biology.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWood bought 320,000 shares on May 1, though those purchases were part of a larger pattern of building her position back up. Her Ark ETFs own 6.59 million shares, or almost 2.5 times the number the funds held back in October when she began a massive buying campaign. 10X Genomics, though, only accounts for 1.5% of her holdings.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWood recently took a renewed interest in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), buying over $4 million worth of stock, or nearly 9,000 shares across several ETFs. It’s not a bad bet. The stock tumbled hard after the social media stock reported first-quarter results that beat analyst expectations.\n\nYet there was much to like in the report beyond the earnings beat, particularly as advertising dollars flooded back into the company. What spooked investors, though, was CEO Mark Zuckerberg committing to spending billions of dollars on AI. They remember all too well the spending spree he went on with the metaverse and are fearful of a similar result. The metaverse play has cost Meta Platforms $45 billion so far and counting. They don’t want a repeat performance.\n\nStill, Wood has a small position, not much more than 10X Genomics. Across her Ark Invest ETFs, Meta Platforms represent just 1.690% of the total, good enough to rank 17th overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg's Net Worth Grew By $84 Billion In 2023, But His Salary Was Just $1\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the world's fourth-richest person, received a salary of just $1 in 2023, but his total compensation amounted to $24.4 million.\n\nZuckerberg has been a member of the $1 salary club since 2013. Over the years, he has officially earned $11 on paper. Former Google CEO Larry Page, Oracle Corp. Co-Founder Larry Ellison and the late Apple Inc. Co-Founder Steve Jobs are also part of the $1 salary club. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk, who earned a $0 salary in 2023, is compensated through stock options.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here’s how anyone can invest for a limited time. Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women’s health problem at 80 cents per share.\n\nAbout $14 million of Zuckerberg’s $24.4 million \"other compensation\" was allocated to personal security, and approximately $1 million was designated for costs related to his use of private aircraft, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n“We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the filing stated. “Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most recognized executives in the world, in large part as a result of the size of our user base and our continued exposure to global media, legislative, and regulatory attention.”\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\nZuckerberg’s wealth recently reached its peak at $177 billion, before plummeting by $22 billion following Meta’s earnings report on April 25. The decline was attributed to an 11% drop in Meta stock price. Zuckerberg's current net worth is $155.2 billion.\n\nDespite the drop, Zuckerberg still kept his spot as the world's fourth-richest person behind LVMH's Bernard Arnault, Amazon.com Inc.'s Jeff Bezos and Musk.\n\nDuring the call, Zuckerberg said, \"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\n\nZuckerberg holds approximately 345 million Class A and B shares in Meta.\n\nIn contrast to Zuckerberg’s minimal salary, the average Meta employee earned $379,000, according to Fortune magazine.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nInvest like a millionaire.

        "content": "Apple Continues Being Mysterious About AI While Services Reach A New Revenue Record And The iPhone Continues Its Fall From Glory\n\nOn Thursday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) issued its fiscal second quarter results and although they were slightly higher than Wall Street expected, Apple posted a revenue drop, including falling iPhone sales. But Apple’s biggest news were that the board authorized its largest ever share buyback. The board authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, which represents a 22% YoY increase compared to last year’s authorization.\n\nFiscal Second Quarter Highlights\n\nRevenue dropped 4% YoY to $90.75 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $90.01 billion. Net income contracted 2% YoY to $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, while gross margin of 46.6% was in line with LSEG’s estimate.\n\nApple's revenue empire is undergoing a major restructuring.\n\niPhone sales tanked 10% YoY to $45.96 billion, while LSEG estimated $46 billion but CEO Tim Cook emphasized that these sales suffered from a difficult comparison as during last year’s comparable quarter, Apple realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues.\n\nMac brought in sales of $7.5 billion as revenue rose 4% YoY due to new MacBook Air models released with an upgraded M3 chip in March, exceeding LSEG’s estimate of $6.86 billion. iPad revenue tanked 17% YoY as it amounted to $5.6 billion, coming short of LSEG’s $5.91 billion. Other products brought in $7.9 billion, also falling short of LSEG’s estimate of $8.08 billion.\n\nA rare bright spot, services brought $23.9 billion to the revenue table, exceeding LSEG’s estimate of $23.27 billion as the segment continued to grow at a pace of 14.2% YoY.\n\nAn Unknown Outlook\n\nAlthough it did not provide an official guidance, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke of sales growth in the “low single digits” for the June quarter, while CFO Luca Maestri mentioned a double-digit YoY percentage growth in iPad saleswith services continuing to grow at about the latest reported rate. Apple is also due to announce new iPads in May that are expected to revive demand.\n\nWhat about AI?\n\nIt’s safe to say that there’s no tech company that hasn’t been heavily investing in generative AI over the past two years. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) decided to spend even more money on its development. With its latest earnings report, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that it will take years for Meta to start making money from AI. Fortunately, Meta has a good track record when it comes to monetizing its assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut, Apple is still being mysterious about its plans as generative AI didn’t make a big part of the earnings conversation. Once again, Cook only provided a teaser, perhaps somewhat bolder, saying that Apple has big generative AI plans that will differentiate it from its competitors. Hopefully, more about Apple’s AI roadmap will be revealed during its developer event in June.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Could Be Worth $2 Trillion By 2030",
        "content": "Companies seeking to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) market keep popping up like weeds. That includes many start-ups most haven't heard of and likely never will. These relatively small companies can be incredibly innovative, but it's hard -- and risky -- to try to profit from the AI boom by investing in privately held start-ups. Thankfully, there is no shortage of established corporations on the market that should benefit from the rise of AI.\n\nOne of the better bets in this field is none other than Facebook parent Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) with a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Let's find out why the stock could double in value by 2030.\n\nGoing all in on AI\n\nMeta Platforms makes most of its money through advertising. However, the company is quickly implementing various AI initiatives to support and improve its existing primary revenue source while seeking to ramp up new ones.\n\nPerhaps Meta's most important move in AI has been the release of its large language model (LLM), Llama, which it first launched last year. Llama is the backbone behind some of Meta Platforms' other AI-related offerings, including Meta AI, a virtual assistant.\n\nThe company's other products include Business AI, which assists companies with customer support and various other things.\n\nThese are the initiatives that don't make money yet, but Meta Platforms is planning to double down and spend more on building them up. And some of Meta's AI-related work is indeed helping it generate meaningful revenue.\n\nFor example, the company has used an AI-powered algorithm to drive recommendations for Reels (short-form videos) on Facebook and Instagram. The more viewers stumble onto videos they like, the longer they spend on this platform, and the more attractive it becomes to advertisers, which is an excellent illustration of the network effect.\n\nAlhough Reels haven't been a thing for that long, Meta Platforms reports that they now make up more than 50% of the time spent on the Instagram app. Reels, longer-form videos, and live videos continue driving growth on Facebook, too, with the former being responsible for most of it, according to management.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta Platforms' revenue increased by 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, while its earnings per share soared 114% to $4.71. Reels, whose growth has been driven partly thanks to Meta's AI work, is having somewhat of an impact on the company's strong results.\n\nThe road to $2 trillion\n\nMeta Platforms' first-quarter results were solid, but investors were disappointed that the company would continue spending small fortunes on ramping up AI initiatives that don't generate much by way of profits. However, that's a somewhat myopic position, at least in my view. Here's what we know. The AI market will grow rapidly in the coming years. Meta Platforms is already a leader in the field, partly thanks to Llama, a leading LLM.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant is also implementing various AI measures within its business. Then there is Meta's superpower: its enormous ecosystem. It ended the first quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users across its websites and apps, an increase of 7% year over year. So, nearly half of the world's population uses at least one of the company's products every single day.\n\nThat makes Meta's ecosystem a magnet for businesses trying to attract customers. It also grants Meta the opportunity to test and find lucrative monetization opportunities. That, combined with its work in AI, looks likely to pay off handsome dividends down the road, literally, as Meta recently initiated a quarterly payout. That's before we mention the company's ongoing work on the metaverse, which could also be highly lucrative.\n\nMeta Platforms boasts multiple opportunities and should continue to deliver solid financial results. Doubling in value in the next six years will take a compound annual growth rate of 12.2% -- that's well within the company's reach. Don't be surprised if Meta Platforms is a $2 trillion stock by the end of 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Instead of Buying Nvidia Stock, I'm Buying This AI ETF Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Climbing 467% over the past three years, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has skyrocketed as investors have raced to gain artificial intelligence (AI) exposure. Those looking to add AI exposure to their portfolios may feel they've missed the boat on Nvidia stock. Plus, they may feel overwhelmed by the variety of other choices to consider.\n\nBut the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: CHAT) has all those bases covered. In addition to holding a large position in Nvidia, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF provides exposure to a variety of other AI-focused companies that stand to benefit from growth in generative AI, machine learning, and large language models.\n\nThis is going to be big\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that people had little exposure to generative AI. Nowadays, it feels unavoidable. \r\nAnd it's nearly a certainty that its presence in our lives is going to continue ramping higher. In fact, many pundits predict that it's going to accelerate considerably. Business intelligence firm Markets and Markets projects the generative AI market will represent about $21 billion in 2024 and soar at a 37% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 when it will reach $137 billion.\n\nEager to benefit from the growth in generative AI, investors have unsurprisingly raced to Nvidia stock. A leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia helps data centers handle the tremendous computing demands that generative AI platforms place on them. With its recent rise, however, Nvidia stock is now trading at 69 times operating cash flow (OCF), making it unappealing for those looking to avoid high valuations.\n\nAn AI ETF like no other\n\nBranding the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF as the \"world's first Generative AI ETF,\" Roundhill Investments, the manager of the fund, cites research from GoldmanSachs that estimates AI can contribute to $7 trillion in economic growth worldwide over the next 10 years.\n\nWith 46 holdings in the fund, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF offers investors wide exposure to leading companies that will drive the advancement of generative AI. Of course, Nvidia holds a prominent position in the ETF with a 10.1% weighting, making it the largest position, so those wary of Nvidia stock on its own will still have some exposure. Rounding out the top-three positions, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are the second- and third-largest positions, respectively.\n\nWhereas Nvidia makes the GPUs that help support generative AI computing, Microsoft is developing AI solutions such as Copilot, an AI assistant that integrates with several Microsoft products. The company's reach in AI extends further with its multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT. Similarly, Google is incorporating AI into offerings such as Gemini, a generative AI chatbot. And in exploring the potential for AI in various applications, Google operates the DeepMind Lab where its exploring the development of artificial general intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META), whose Llama 3 large language model can be used to develop generative AI applications, is the fifth-largest position in the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, it's not only Magnificent Seven stocks that hold top spots; Adobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) is the fourth-largest position. A generative AI application, Adobe's Firefly can be used across various Adobe products, such as Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator.\n\nIs the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology right for you?\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia stock is extremely alluring right now considering the company's position as a stalwart GPU developer, but it's hardly the only generative AI game in town. Investors cognizant of this fact -- and who are looking for comprehensive exposure to the industry -- therefore will want to pay particular attention to the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, which provides a singular opportunity to gain broad exposure to generative AI. I know I am. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been on my watchlist for several months now, and I plan on starting a position in the coming weeks to sit in the niche of my portfolio carved out for growth investments.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The fact that multiple Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Meta Platforms\n\nThe Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$452. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nMeta Platforms insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Meta Platforms better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nMeta Platforms Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. In total, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth sold US$3.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Meta Platforms\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$157b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Meta Platforms Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider sold Meta Platforms shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Meta Platforms. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Meta Platforms.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "title": "The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge",
        "content": "Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up.\n\nSo does the rest of Silicon Valley.\n\nA landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.\n\nGoogle's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: \"Google is winning because it’s better,\" he said.\n\nA government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court on Oct. 30, in Washington, D.C., after testifying in the antitrust case against his company. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nThat's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.\n\nIn Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.”\n\nA similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance.\n\n\"The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,\" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross.\n\n\"I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,\" Ross added, \"and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.\"\n\nThe government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.\n\nGenerally, Ross said, prosecutors are inclined to craft narrower market definitions to make it easier to prove a defendant holds a monopoly.\n\nHow courts react to those arguments, he added, will be significant.\n\nNew York University Law professor Harry First said the impact of Google's case also depends on the extent to which the judge accepts or rejects one of the government’s antitrust theories — that Google’s collective actions qualify as anticompetitive.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat strategy has been unsuccessful for the DOJ so far, including in its landmark case in the 1990s that eventually forced Microsoft (MSFT) into a settlement to open its operating system to competitors in the early 2000s. Amit Mehta, left, is the judge overseeing the Google antitrust case. Here he is pictured in 2012 when he was an attorney before the New York State Supreme Court. (DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\nBut if the judge in the Google case is persuaded that the theory has some merit, First explained, it could alter the way future antitrust cases are evaluated.\n\n\"I'm curious to see the extent to which the government tries to return to that theme and maybe move it in a direction that could be useful in other cases,\" First said.\n\nMany companies could be impacted by what the judge decides, even beyond the world of tech.\n\nA government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.\n\nThe government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\nGovernment prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.\n\nIn 2022, according to prosecutors, those payments totaled roughly $20 billion. The DOJ said its figure represented 15%-20% of Apple’s worldwide net income. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in April. (REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nSome tech companies, however, stand to gain if the government ultimately prevails.\n\nA breakup of Google’s contractual arrangements could boost rival search engines like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo.\n\nIt could also open the door to newcomer search engines and mobile manufacturers.\n\nAmazon, for its part, exited the mobile phone market after Google's contracts allegedly prevented it from attracting manufacturers to its alternative operating system, Fire OS, a competing \"fork\" to Google’s Android operating system.\n\nProsecutors said manufacturers were concerned that Amazon's partnership with Bing for mobile search services would risk lucrative deals with Google.\n\nThe government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.\n\nThe outcome of November's presidential election could also impact the case, which was brought under former President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nIf Biden is defeated, a new administration could decide to pursue different remedies or drop the case altogether.\n\nThe judge in this case, Mehta, may or may not have tipped his hand in his final questions to the lawyers during closing arguments this past week.\n\nHe pushed back on arguments made by both sides.\n\n\"You can talk about competition, but the competitor bears some responsibility for competing,\" Mehta said while also questioning why new rivals were not pushing to enter Google's market — and whether that's even possible.\n\n“It seems to be very, very unlikely, if not impossible, under the current market conditions,” Mehta said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The stock market is filled with many opportunities, but some promising picks lose value in the short run. Some of these dips only last a few days, while others can extend for several months. When great stocks go on sale, investors can accumulate more shares with the same amount of capital.\n\nThese bargain deals don’t last forever, as investors soon remember the long-term growth prospects of stocks on the discount rack. These discounted stocks have outperformed the market but are offering investors a second chance due to recent pullbacks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has become the most undervalued stock among the Magnificent Seven cohort. Shares dropped 10% on a good earnings report. Some investors wanted more, but the company delivered good earnings and only trades at a 25.9 P/E ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRevenue increased by 27% year-over-year (YoY), while net income surged by 117% YoY. Daily active users grew 7% YoY to reach 3.24 billion users among its platforms. Meta Platforms also stands to benefit if the TikTok ban goes through.\n\nThe deadline is January 19, 2025, one day before the next presidential inauguration. ByteDance stated it will not sell TikTok. The app reached 150 million American users in March 2023. It’s very safe to assume the number has soared since then. These users will have to use other social networks to fill in the time if the January 19th ban passes. Meta Platforms stands to benefit. The company has gained 26% year-to-date.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has been a top-performing stock. It’s gained more than 1,150% over the past five years and has a decent 13% year-to-date gain. However, the stock is in the middle of a correction heading into its next earnings report. Investors were spooked over a warning from Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) about softening demand for its beauty products.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty has been growing at a faster rate than Ulta. The smaller firm has also been gaining more market share. ELF delivered 85% YoY net sales growth and gained 305 basis points of market share in Q3 FY24.\n\nThe latest earnings report extended e.l.f. Beauty’s streak to 20 consecutive quarters of growth. Net income jumped by 41% YoY, and the company significantly raised its fiscal 2024 guidance for net sales, net income and other metrics. The future looks bright for the beauty firm, and the recent pullback offers an opportunity for patient investors.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nStory continues\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) generated a lot of buzz about its add to the S&P 500. The athletic apparel giant is up 25% year-to-date and has soared by 431% over the past five years. Despite the long-term gains, Deckers Outdoor is in the middle of a correction. Shares are down by more than 12% from their all-time high.\n\nThe company has several popular brands under its corporate umbrella, such as UGG and HOKA. Those two brands helped Deckers Outdoor deliver 16% YoY net sales growth in Q3 FY24. Diluted EPS jumped by 44% YoY as the corporation improved its profit margins. The HOKA brand stood out with 21.9% YoY revenue growth.\n\nDeckers Outdoor is still growing, while larger competitors like Nike (NYSE:NKE) are faltering. That setup gives Deckers Outdoor a good opportunity to gain market share. The company is also growing with a sustainable business model based on its 25.0% net profit margin.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF and DECK.

        "title": "Here's My Pick for the Best Mega-Cap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Like many investors, I'm enthralled by the opportunities unleashed by artificial intelligence (AI). I agree with predictions that AI could be as big (or bigger) than the internet.\n\nWhich AI stocks are likely to be the biggest winners? Different people will have different answers to the question. Here's my pick for the best mega-cap AI stock to buy right now.\n\nOne of the cheapest mega-cap AI stocks around\n\nI like many of the mega-cap leaders in AI, including most of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. However, valuation is an important factor to me. Many AI stocks with market caps of $200 billion or more trade at a lofty premium. But not Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nMeta's attractive valuation is a key reason I think it's the best mega-cap AI stock to buy right now. The company's shares trade at 22 times forward earnings, lower than most of its peers. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, based on analysts' five-year growth projections, is only 1.02.\n\nSome investors bailed on Meta after the company's first-quarter update. Shares are down roughly 17% primarily because of concerns about Meta's capital expenditures increasing as the company focuses on current money-losing AI and metaverse initiatives.\n\nThis sell-off was way overdone, in my view. Meta delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in Q1. I think the company's investments in AI and the metaverse will deliver strong returns over time. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that'll be the case. He provided a reminder in the Q1 earnings call that the company's history shows that spending money to scale new technology \"has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us.\"\n\nHow Meta can win with AI\n\nAI is already making a difference in Meta's operations. Zuckerberg noted in the Q1 call that around 30% of Facebook posts are delivered by the company's AI recommendation system, double the level from two years ago. Over 50% of the content on Instagram is recommended by AI. The more content appeals to users, the more attractive Meta's social media platforms will be to advertisers.\n\nSpeaking of advertisers, Meta is using AI to help them improve their return on investment. Revenue flowing through two of the company's AI-powered tools, Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns, has increased more than 100% since last year.\n\nMeta recently launched its smart glasses with AI vision integration. Customers can ask the Meta AI assistant questions about things they're viewing. Zuckerberg thinks there's a \"meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe sees multiple ways for Meta to profit in a huge way from AI in addition to selling smart glasses. Placing ads or paid content in AI interactions is one possibility. Charging for access to large-scale AI models is another.\n\nPerhaps the biggest near-term opportunity is using AI in business messaging. Meta is already testing functionality where businesses use AI assistants that interact with customers in chats. The feedback so far from businesses and consumers has been positive, according to Zuckerberg.\n\nTiming is everything\n\nWill Meta always be my favorite mega-cap AI stock? Almost certainly not. New AI developments are happening at a breakneck speed. Meta's valuation could increase so much that it's no longer attractive. Other AI stocks could fall and create great buying opportunities.\n\nA year from now, I might like Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, or another big AI leader more than I do Meta. For now, though, Meta ranks at the top of my list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's Why I'm Loading Up on Meta Platforms Stock",
        "content": "Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock has been on quite a run in 2024, with the stock up around 20% this year. Normally, investors would consider that a pretty good year, but up until a week ago, that figure was over 40%.\n\nThanks to a 10% plummet the day following its earnings report, Meta lost a lot of ground it had gained. But unlike some investors, I don't think this news is a reason to sell; it's one to buy.\n\nMeta Platforms is still an advertising business at heart\n\nMeta Platforms is probably better known by its former name, Facebook. Even though it changed its name a couple of years ago, Meta Platforms is still driven by its social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\n\nHowever, its name change signaled its shift into developing the metaverse and other cutting-edge products. And this other division, Reality Labs, has been quite a money pit for Meta. In the fourth quarter, Reality Labs saw its highest revenue total, adding $1 billion to the top line. Yet it lost $4.6 billion in operating income. Q1 wasn't any better, with revenue of $440 million and an operating loss of $3.8 billion.\n\nIn 2022, Reality Labs' expenditures seemed like a Mark Zuckerberg pet project, and many investors were frustrated that Meta was burning money in pursuit of unprofitable goals. In 2023, the company turned it around by cutting costs in this division, which boosted profits and made investors happy.\n\nHowever, Meta looks like it's about to repeat the same mistake.\n\nIts forward-looking guidance raised the range of its 2024 capital expenditures (capex) \"to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI [artificial intelligence] roadmap.\" Furthermore, management stated that capex will likely increase in years to come because of this aggressive AI roadmap.\n\nThat's why Meta's stock plummeted after earnings, as investors felt like they were reliving 2022 all over again. However, this time I think it's different.\n\nThe stock is on sale thanks to investor pessimism\n\nIt's obvious that artificial intelligence will become a much larger part of this world. For Meta to survive and thrive, it will need AI models to assist its advertising platform and integrate into other hardware projects it has going on.\n\nThe biggest example is Meta's digital assistant AI glasses, which it collaborated with Ray-Ban (a subsidiary of EssilorLuxottica) to make. This AI assistant can see what you're looking at (because of embedded cameras within the glasses) and answer questions. While this technology hasn't hit the mainstream yet, it could change how society functions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf even one of its Reality Labs products becomes a mainstream hit, Meta will have created a lucrative new revenue stream.\n\nBut if it doesn't, the core business is still quite profitable.\n\nIn Q1, Meta's overall revenue rose 27% due to the strength in its ad business. Thanks to various efficiency measures in 2023, operating margin also massively improved from 25% to 38%. The company also expects a strong Q2, with revenue expected to grow by around 18%.\n\nClearly, Meta is doing just fine as a business. Investors are just a bit worried that history will repeat itself with its latest round of AI investments. I'm not worried, as this technology actually has a more monetizable use case than the metaverse did.\n\nDue to the stock drop, it's also much cheaper than it was just a few days ago. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt just under 22 times sales, it's fairly priced and nearly in line with the S&P 500's price tag of 20.8 times forward earnings.\n\nI liked Meta's stock even before the fall. Now that it's much cheaper, I'm an even bigger fan, and will keep buying this long-term winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Virtual Reality Stocks With the Potential to Make You an Overnight Millionaire",
        "content": "Stock market investing can be intimidating, but it’s the large multi-year trends could potentially make you a millionaire. Virtual reality (VR) is one such trend, offering the potential for significant financial gains for those willing to take the risk. Moreover, with the market pulling back, it’s an excellent time to load up on some virtual reality stocks offering long-term upside.\n\nVR isn’t a novel concept, but the latest developments in hardware and the pervasiveness of generative AI could take things up a notch or two.  Moreover, over the years, we’ve seen how VR’s use cases extend far beyond its traditional gaming and entertainment roots. To put things in perspective, the global VR market is projected to grow to more than $22 billion by 2025 from under $12 billion in 2022. Having said that, here are three virtual reality stocks to buy that could be long-term multi-bagger investments.\n\nTop Virtual Reality Stocks: Sony (SONY) Sony logo on the side of a building at its offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nVR has always been about video gaming and tech giant Sony (NYSE:SONY) is the best exponent of this trend. Many consider it to be an industry pioneer, having been one of the biggest needle-movers in the VR realm.  Its PlayStation VR is the culmination of 23 years of ambitions in the niche, producing one of the finest gaming-focused VR headsets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, the latest iteration of Sony’s VR headset in PSVR 2 has been hit by demand weakness on the back of broader market headwinds. Sales have dropped since its release in February last year, with shipments tanking 50% on a year-over-year (YOY) basis in the fourth-quarter of 2023 (Q4). Sony has paused production since then and is looking to clear out its unsold inventory.\n\nNonetheless, the softness in demand is mostly linked to the slowdown in the gaming sector. A combination of factors is at play there, but from a purely product perspective, the PSVR is as good as it gets.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) was blazing the VR trial before it was cool! The metaverse gaming platform has been empowering its massive userbase to create, share, and explore immersive virtual experiences long before the VR hype.  It experienced a meteoric rise during the pandemic, with millions flocked to its platforms, resulting in record top-line growth.\n\nDespite stumbling for a while post-pandemic, Roblox is back in form, beating top-line estimates in each of the four quarters last year. RBLX stock, though, hasn’t followed suit, with investors fixated over the lack of profits. However, it appears that the company will continue prioritizing growth over cost-cutting measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, its investments in developer tools and AI could add new layers to its bombastic growth story.  Also, with double-digit gains in its active user base over the past several quarters, the company projects at least 20% growth through 2027. Hence, RBLX is a bona fide growth stock with the tools to grow at a healthy pace.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) made a strong comeback last year, effectively addressing the issues that marred its performance in 2022. The focus in 2023 was on Meta’s AI initiatives, cost-cutting measures, and other strategic moves, which resulted in a significant 50% surge in free cash flows.\n\nHowever, a couple of years ago, we thought Meta was moving in a completely different trajectory. Meta’s trajectory was all about its VR and AR initiatives and its goal of commercializing the metaverse. Though these plans took a backseat in 2022, I feel it’s unlikely that Meta will keep the foot off the gas for long.\n\nIts CEO and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, talked about how the metaverse represents the next frontier of the internet. These comments allude to how Meta is aiming to capitalize on the full potential of VR. Moreover, following its blow-out results in 2023, it now has the impetus to get the ball rolling again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Alert: 3 Must-Buy Social Media Stocks When Prices Plunge",
        "content": "Social media stocks have had plenty of activity in the past couple of months. Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) went public to much fanfare, while former President Trump’s controversial Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) finally completed its merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. Moreover, we recently saw the leading social media giants dish out another solid quarter of growth across both lines. Hence, it’s tough to remove social stocks to buy out of the equation.\n\nThough the conversation has centered around artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year, the truth is that even without it, social media sites remain incredibly profitable investments. AI will lead to greater engagement and time spent on top social media platforms. More time spent means more opportunities for social media companies to milk more from their user base. With that thought, here are three social media stocks that stand head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) someone using the Facebook (FB stock) app on their phone in front of a laptop that also has the Facebook webpage on it\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo social media stocks to buy list is complete without Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). It’s behind some of the biggest social media platforms of all time, effectively shaping the modern social media landscape. Its family of apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, collectively boast an eye-popping user base of 3.98 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast year was massive for Meta’s business and stock. Meta made impressive inroads on the AI front while streamlining its operations to cut costs. The results were staggering, resulting in more than a 50% increase in free cash flow and top- and bottom-line beats in each of the four quarters.\n\nIt recently posted impressive first-quarter (Q1) earnings results, blowing past analyst estimates across both lines. Its revenues increased roughly 27% to $36.46 billion, beating estimates by $231.9 million. Moreover, its earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71, beat estimates by 35 cents. However, its stock nosedived following the release of cautious forward guidance. The market has this wrong, making it an excellent time to scoop up the stock on the dip.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Hand holding Apple Iphone6 gold color with Pinterest app on the screen.

PINS stock.\n\nSource: photobyphotoboy / Shutterstock\n\nThe image-based social media platform Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) is on fire right now.  Following its Q1 earnings print, the stock jumped by double digits, which crushed estimates across both lines. Moreover, it surpassed $500 million monthly users, a record-high for the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPinterest’s Q1 revenues demonstrated a robust growth of 23%, reaching an impressive $740 million. This surpassed analyst estimates by a substantial $40 million. Furthermore, the company’s strategic cost reduction of 6% led to a significant decrease in its operating loss, from $ 243.7 million to $54.4 million. The average revenue-per-user (ARPU) also saw a healthy increase of 10% globally, reflecting the platform’s strong performance across all regions.\n\nThese spectacular results were reminiscent of Pinterest’s peak popularity during the pandemic years. In fact, according to CEO Bill Ready, its Q1 results showed the “fastest user and revenue growth since 2021”.\n\nPINS stock skyrocketed last year, growing almost 90%, and is up 16% this month despite the pullback in the broader market. Despite the eye-catching gains, analysts expect a 6% upside from current prices based on average price targets.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of the leading Chinese social media players, leveraging the power of its robust super-app WeChat. With a whopping 1.3 billion monthly active users, WeChat has its tentacles spread across various tech verticals, including fintech, gaming, telehealth and now AI. The evolution of the app has allowed Tencent to enhance user engagement across its platform effectively. Moreover, despite the looming threat of regulatory oversight, the company has played it safe, effectively minimizing the risk of disruptive penalties from the Chinese government.\n\nRecent operating results have been marred by headwinds in the Chinese market, but the firm has done well in maintaining decent growth while maintaining its profitability positioning. Moreover, it unveiled its dynamic Hunyuan AI model, which could potentially be a major growth catalyst for the firm down the road.\n\nTCEHY stock was relatively muted compared to other tech players in 2023 but has made up for lost ground this year. The stock is up roughly 25% year-to-date (YTD), with more upside potential ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Democratic officials criticize Meta ad policy, saying it amplifies lies about 2020 election",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — Several Democrats serving as their state's top election officials have sent a letter to the parent company of Facebook, asking it to stop allowing ads that claim the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nIn the letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the secretaries of state from Colorado, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Vermont said allowing such ads will further erode trust in elections and fuel threats of political violence against election workers, which already has led some to leave the profession. Also signing the letter was Wisconsin Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, who does not oversee elections.\n\n“Meta is allowing extremists and election deniers to further undermine our elections,” the secretaries wrote in the letter, which was emailed to the tech giant on Thursday. “As Secretaries of State, we are strongly opposed to Meta’s decision to allow ads promoting election denialism and urge you to repeal this policy before it inflicts more damage.”\n\nNearly four years later, conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and false claims of widespread fraud and manipulation of voting machines persist. Former President Donald Trump continues to insist, despite no evidence of widespread fraud, that he won that election as he seeks a return to the White House.\n\nReviews, recounts and audits in the swing states where he disputed his loss have all affirmed Democrat Joe Biden's victory, and even Trump's former attorney general said there was no fraud on a scale that could have tipped the election. In an interview this week with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Trump falsely claimed he won Wisconsin despite losing to Biden by about 21,000 votes. Trump told the news outlet he would accept the results of the November election “if everything’s honest.”\n\nSince the 2020 election, election workers across parts of the country have faced death threats and harassment. A recent survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU found that 34% of local election officials said they knew of one or more local election officials or election workers who left their job at least in part because of safety fears, threats or intimidation. The environment has led to a historic turnover of election workers throughout the country.\n\nYouTube, the Google-owned video service, announced a policy similar to Meta's last year in which it said it would stop removing content that falsely claimed previous U.S. presidential elections were tainted by fraud.\n\nMeta has defended the work it's doing to protect elections globally. A company spokesperson provided details about how the company views elections, referencing its 2022 plan for the midterm elections in which the company said it will “continually review content to determine if it violates our community standards, including our policies on election and voter interference, hate speech, coordinating harm and publicizing crime, and bullying and harassment.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAs part of its work, Meta said it would remove election-related content that includes misinformation about the “dates, locations, times and methods of voting” along with calls for violence related to voting or the outcome of an election. In that plan, the company specified it would reject ads calling into question the legitimacy of an upcoming or ongoing election.\n\nBut it's the ads related to the 2020 election that have the group of Democratic secretaries of state concerned, including various campaign ads earlier this year repeating false claims that the election was rigged. The letter was organized by the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, a political action committee affiliated with the Democratic National Committee, and was circulated only among Democrats.\n\n“When people believe an election was stolen they are less likely to have confidence in the system, and that depresses turnout,\" Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said in an interview Friday. \"We want voters to know the truth about elections and feel empowered to participate.”\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Smaller social platforms are adding TikTok-like features as TikTok’s future hangs in the balance",
        "content": "LTK is not TikTok. The creator-focused shopping platform has just 40 million monthly active users, versus the 1 billion who watch video clips posted on TikTok. TikTok generates about $16 billion in annual revenue whereas LTK makes “hundreds of millions,” according to a company spokesperson. The fact is that most people have never even heard of LTK. But after President Joe Biden last month signed legislation forcing a TikTok sale or ban, LTK and a handful of other smaller social platforms may be able to take advantage and throttle their growth.\n\n“There are opportunities and there are friction points,” says LTK president Amber Venz Box about a potential TikTok ban.\n\nAs it is, LTK is morphing into a more TikTok-like platform by the day. LTK is now emphasizing video, allowing creators to post more in-depth content about the products they’re hawking such as one very TikTok-ish clip about the differences between polyurethane leather stilettos and actual leather ones. The videos can be up to 10 minutes long and feature links to buy the products shown.\n\nIn recent weeks, social gaming company Roblox has also introduced features that mimic TikTok that push it deeper into shopping, user videos, and creators. It premiered a tool from developer Neura Studios for users to create and edit videos, and a hub for posting TikTok-style clips that feature Roblox avatars (rather than actual humans). Roblox also doubled down on its e-commerce arm with a new Walmart partnership to sell the retailer’s products in Roblox’s metaverse. This could entice Roblox’s 71.5 million daily active users, most of them young, to shop more, potentially also attracting some of TikTok’s users and creators.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon-owned Twitch, the live-streaming service popular with gamers, in October started letting users post short disappearing videos, or Stories, like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat and TikTok have long offered. It also just launched a scrollable video feed that looks a lot like TikTok’s For You page—showing users videos that they wouldn't otherwise find.\n\nLTK, Roblox, and Twitch probably would have released their new TikTok-like features regardless of the looming TikTok ban, to be imposed if TikTok’s China-based owner fails to sell the service to a non-China-based buyer. After all, tech companies copy rivals all the time. But the fact that the new products coincide with TikTok’s current turmoil could give them a bigger boost than they would have otherwise got. TikTok has vowed to fight its possible ban in court.\n\nHowever, there are some potential downsides to a TikTok-free future in the U.S. along with the benefits, says LTK’s Venz Box. TikTok users often discover creators on TikTok and then later follow them onto LTK. Without that unofficial funnel, Venz Box worries that traffic to LTK may tumble. It’s difficult to know for sure.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the end, some analysts, including Jasmine Enberg from eMarketer, suspect Alphabet’s YouTube and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram (with emphasis on the Meta properties) stand to benefit the most from a TikTok ban. They could both ultimately strengthen their social media duopoly and put even more pressure on the competition.\n\nAs it is, both companies already have billions of users and huge ad revenue that have helped propel their parent companies to $1 trillion-plus market caps. And their deep pockets have allowed them to afford workforces equivalent to the populations of small cities.\n\nBut killing off one of social media’s titans wouldn’t exactly be a good thing for consumers, says Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in the global regulation of new technologies.\n\n“As with the demise of any big competitor, there will be harm to consumers,” he says. “I think this is a massive detriment to consumers who don’t have this very important forum for expressing themselves or getting entertainment.”\n\nChander also says losing TikTok as a marketing platform would eventually increase prices for online ads on Meta and Google. “It will harm advertisers by potentially raising their rates and reducing competition,” he says.\n\nWhile this may be a long-term consequence, a TikTok ban will be “great” for advertisers over the short term, says Sean Frank, the CEO of accessories brand Ridge. That’s because Meta and Google are more effective than TikTok at driving sales from digital ads, in Frank’s experience, and the ban could send a “flow of users” from TikTok to Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. “There'll be a whole new group of users with a lot of watchtime now falling into a better mousetrap because Meta and Google are the best advertising platforms ever.”\n\nThough Meta would be the obvious winner of a TikTok ban, Frank thinks Snapchat could be a close second. Gen Z are already big Snapchat users and therefore may spend more time on it after a TikTok ban, he says.\n\nSnapchat CEO Evan Spiegel certainly wouldn’t complain about a TikTok-free America. Last year, he said he would “love” a TikTok ban, which could help strengthen his company’s lackluster ads business.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta’s various properties continue to copy TikTok. For example, Instagram just tweaked Reels to show users more videos of topics they’ve already shown an interest in, but from creators they don’t already follow. TikTok has long had a similar feature. In discussing the change, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said he hopes “smaller creators start to see the benefits over the coming months.”\n\nOf course, there is another possibility if TikTok goes away—that people end up spending less time on their phones. “If someone’s not using Twitch today, and they’re a TikTok user, will they just automatically switch to Twitch?” asks Tammy Madsen, a management professor at Santa Clara University who specializes in competitive strategy. “That’s not automatic. These companies existed prior to TikTok, and [some] users were not interested in the platforms.”\n\nMore tech news below.\n\nAlexandra Sternlicht\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 25 richest billionaires in technology industry. To skip our detailed analysis of the technology industry, go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires in Technology Industry.\n\nTechnology Market Outlook\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, 2023 experienced a technological comeback and generative AI was one of the major drivers of the tech industry. Generative AI is the technology that powers large language models such as ChatGPT and Adobe Photoshop's new AI image filler, Generative Fill. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the AI market was valued at $40 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 42%. The increasing demand for generative AI products will add nearly about $280 billion of new software revenue. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are four of the biggest tech companies investing heavily in generative AI and are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of AI, as per  Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIn a report, Deloitte highlighted that global IT investments are projected to experience a double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services in 2024. AI-related investments are expected to reach $200 billion globally by 2025, primarily led by the US. Almost all enterprise software firms will embed generative AI into at least some of their products in 2024, as per Deloitte. The shift towards generative AI will likely help software companies reach an average revenue of $10 billion by the end of 2024. For the firms working on the hardware front, Deloitte estimates their revenue to surpass $50 billion in 2024, driven by the chips and servers market.\n\nOn April 28, Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk, on X posted that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will spend around $10 billion in combined training and inference AI during 2024. Musk further said, “Any company not spending at this level, and doing so efficiently, cannot compete.”\n\nThe technology industry is diverse and has vast market segments. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global IT market was valued at $8.50 trillion in 2023 and is expected to reach $9.03 trillion in 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. By 2028, the IT market is anticipated to reach $12.41 trillion, growing at a compound growth rate of 8.3% from 2024 to 2028.\n\nMajor Players in The Technology Industry\n\nSome of the major players in the tech space include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let's discuss some recent updates by these companies. These companies are also some of the most popular technology stocks among billionaires.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has become one of those few companies achieving the $2 trillion market capitalization mark. The company reached the $2 trillion market capitalization following its first quarter earnings beat. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the earnings for the first quarter of 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $1.89, beating consensus by $0.39. The revenue was reported at around $80.54 billion and surpassed estimates by $1.84 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is planning for the next wave of AI investment. Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“It was a great quarter led by a strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we've gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue.\n\nNow, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation and search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths.”\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech giant that is massively expanding in AI services. On April 29, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that it is collaborating with German mass media firm, Axel Springer SE. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Axel Springer SE have expanded their partnership across advertising, AI, content, and cloud computing. The collaboration between the two firms aims to leverage cutting-edge innovation to evolve independent journalism worldwide. Here is what Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO, Satya Nadella, said regarding the partnership extension:\n\n“This new generation of AI is transforming nearly every aspect of work and life, including how people search for and consume content online. Our expanded partnership with Axel Springer brings together their leadership in digital publishing with the full power of the Microsoft Cloud — including our ad solutions — to build innovative AI-driven experiences and create new opportunity for advertisers and users.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world. The company is mainly focused on AI-driven technology across its segments. On April 19, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported that two of its latest chips, NVIDIA RTX A400 and A1000, will enhance AI-powered design and productivity workflows. In addition, the AI-powered chips will have the ability to help professionals and creatives with better computing power, regardless of the scale and complexity of their projects.\n\nThe technology industry is expected to experience strong growth in 2024 and beyond.

        "content": "By Sheila Dang\n\n(Reuters) - Short-form video took center stage at tech and social media companies' annual presentations to advertisers, as platforms like Snap and Meta look to capitalize on TikTok's political uncertainty in the U.S. to take ad dollars from their rival.\n\nThe presentations in New York, known as the NewFronts, come just a week after U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill that gives Chinese tech company ByteDance up to one year to divest TikTok, or else the app will be banned over national security concerns. TikTok has vowed to fight the legislation.\n\nThe short video platform announced new sports and entertainment partnerships at its NewFront on Thursday evening, including an agreement that broadcaster NBCUniversal will post clips of this summer's Paris Olympics on TikTok.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTikTok is expected to generate $8.66 billion in U.S. ad revenue this year according to an estimate from research firm Emarketer. While it is a fraction of the size of Google and Meta, TikTok kicked off the short-form video craze and prompted rivals to build similar features.\n\n\"TikTok must show advertisers that it's business-as-normal, even though it's anything but,\" Emarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Snap, which owns photo messaging app Snapchat, said it would also partner with NBCUniversal to send popular influencers to the games to film content. It will also host clips of top concerts from events promoter Live Nation.\n\n\"We're having very productive conversations about how Snapchat can help, because there is a lot of noise at the moment,\" said Patrick Harris, Snap's president of Americas and partnerships. \"But we have our heads down and we're making sure we're a dependable and viable platform.\"\n\nThe focus on professionally produced videos is designed to attract brands wary of the downside of social media or artificial intelligence (AI) generated content.\n\n\"Brands have to spend a little extra time really thinking about the quality of environments, which is why these content partnerships that are being spun up are so important,\" said Robert Silver, head of media at digital marketing firm Razorfish.\n\nStory continues\n\nFacebook and Instagram owner Meta focused its NewFront on Reels, its TikTok competitor that now accounts for half of the time users spend on Instagram.\n\n\"Instagram Reels already stands to benefit from a TikTok ban, and Meta wants to ensure that it can attract all the potential displaced users and revenues it can,\" Emarketer's Enberg said.\n\nGoogle said on Monday that its own short-form video feature called YouTube Shorts are increasingly being viewed on TV screens in addition to phones.\n\nDespite the uncertainty over TikTok's future, advertisers say they intend to focus on the near-term and some plan to continue advertising until it is no longer possible to do so.\n\n\"I think we need to put some blinders on and focus and try to understand on what innovative capabilities are available for advertisers,\" said Alex Stone, senior vice president of agency partnerships at media buying firm Horizon Media, referring to TikTok's NewFront.\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in New York; Editing by Michael Erman)",

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Google, US clash over search advertising as trial winds down",
        "content": "(New throughout, adds start of arguments from government, Google)\n\nBy Mike Scarcella\n\nWASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) -\n\nGoogle and the U.S. Justice Department clashed in court on Friday over claims that the Alphabet unit unlawfully schemed to dominate search advertising, during closing arguments in a case the government contends could shape the “future of the internet.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington grilled both sides with questions, probing whether competitive platforms such as ByteDance’s TikTok and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram are competitive substitutes for search advertising dollars.\n\nMehta called platform “substitutability” for advertisers a central issue the court must resolve, as he prepares to render a major decision in coming months on whether Google's conduct broke antitrust law.\n\nThe judge also questioned whether Google assesses competitors’ pricing before making its own adjustments. Google's advertising business is responsible for about three quarters of its revenue.\n\nU.S. government lawyer David Dahlquist argued that “advertising revenue is what drives Google’s monopoly power today.”\n\nGoogle boasted it has no real market pressure, Dahlquist said, arguing that the company does not fear increasing its pricing or not improving its products. “Only a monopolist can make a product worse and still make more money,” Dahlquist argued.\n\nGoogle’s lawyer John Schmidtlein on Friday countered that Google’s share of U.S. digital advertising revenue has steadily decreased. He touted the advertising power of rival platforms ByteDance's TikTok, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, and Amazon.\n\nSchmidtlein argued that Google is “constrained” by rival platforms \"where the eyeballs are,\" because advertisers know there are overlapping audiences and can spend dollars away from Google.\n\nHe also asserted that Google was continually moving to innovate its search advertising products. “If Google is a monopolist, why improve anything? Why not just jack the price up?” he told the court.\n\nThe Justice Department has hammered away at Google in a trial that started on Sept. 12, contending the search engine giant is a monopolist that illegally abused its power to boost profits.\n\nWitnesses from Verizon, Android maker Samsung Electronics and Google itself testified about the company's annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\nMehta is expected on Friday to take up the government’s claim that Google intentionally destroyed internal documents that were relevant to the issues in the lawsuit. The government wants Mehta to presume that Google deleted chats that were unfavorable to the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle has defended its data preservation practices, calling them reasonable, and urged the court not to sanction the company.\n\nThe court is not expected to issue an oral ruling at the conclusion of the argument.\n\nThis case, filed by former President Donald Trump's administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in the market power of tech leaders.\n\nThe second, against Facebook parent Meta, was also filed during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers have followed with a second case against Google and cases against Amazon.com and Apple Inc.

Given these rosy projections, Apple's toned-down approach toward the technology has raised speculations about whether it is missing out on the AI hype or playing its cards in silence to take the market by surprise.\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nDespite recent financial struggles, including a major revenue slump since the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Apple saw a nearly 50% spike last year, though it lagged other tech giants such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company had a challenging start to 2024 with shares tumbling amid a series of analyst downgrades and was dethroned by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world. Some critics have blamed Apple for not having a clear AI strategy unlike its competitors, such as Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which are aggressively investing in the technology.\n\nWhen it comes to AI (or machine learning, as Apple prefers to say), the company is not new to integrating such features into its devices. It has revolutionized many features using machine learning, including Siri, facial recognition and personalized recommendations. However, in the current landscape, compared to other tech giants, Apple has taken a more cautious approach to introducing and announcing AI features and investments. Apple is making calculated moves in the AI space behind the scenes. The company has acquired several AI start-ups in the past decade and is partnering with universities and research institutions to collaborate on projects.\n\nResearch and development spending is one of the key indicators to measure a company's commitment to introducing new features and advancements into its business strategy, especially for tech companies. Apple's R&D spending was roughly 7% of its revenue for 2022. In comparison, in the same year, Google and Microsoft allocated nearly double for R&D and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) spending was more than four times Apple's. According to the 2023 Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard by the European Commission, Apple ranks in fourth place, above Asian rivals Huawei (fifth) and Samsung (XKRX:005930) (seventh). However, the company ranks below Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft (first three places). While this spending disparity could be highlighting a difference in priorities, it is easy to overlook Apple's strategy of acquiring resources in other areas to step up innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle-Apple alliance: A double-edged sword\n\nRecent reports suggest Apple could enter an AI partnership with Alphabet's Google. As per Bloomberg, Apple is negotiating with the Google parent company to license its state-of-the-art AI model, Gemini. If the deal goes through, Apple might integrate Gemini's AI features into its upcoming operating systems for devices. The possibility of this partnership raises many questions about the company's long-standing tradition of prioritizing in-house development and tight control over its technology.\n\nGoogle and Apple have been in a strategic partnership for a long while and it has proven to be a profitable one. Currently, Google is the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser, and to secure this position Google is reportedly paying around $18 billion annually to Apple. Therefore, Google's AI model Gemini seems like a natural choice for Apple. However, other than the obvious contradiction of the iPhone maker's privacy-first policy, this deal might raise many other concerns, including legal challenges and reduced quality in the user experience.\n\nCurrently, tech giants are facing scrutiny around the world, especially from the U.S. government and European Union. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for its alleged monopoly on the smartphone market and unfair treatment of developers through its App Store system. Partnering with another major tech firm and a rival might fuel the current controversy and could attract more legal scrutiny. Moreover, if Apple begins to rely on Google for AI tools, it could stifle competition and reduce consumer choices in the future for potential AI feature upgrades. Google's AI is a cloud-based system that allows developers to use consumer data to strengthen the LLM to become more efficient, which means the privacy of the user data will not be assured. This means more red flags for Apple.\n\nThe current regulatory scrutiny is already hampering Apple's operations. The potential delay in winning the lawsuit and the restrictions that may be imposed by the government could hinder the company's efforts in the AI field. Additionally, the financial burden of a lawsuit could put a halt on the company's ability to find an internal AI solution. Moreover, a well-defined and transparent data protection framework should be put into practice before entering into a partnership with Google, if at all.\n\nApple's AI master plan\n\nEven though Apple is not vocal about its advancements with AI efforts, several ongoing projects are making progress. News surrounding the company's own AI model has garnered substantial traction. According to sources, Apple has reportedly developed a large language model called Ajax GPT, with a performing capacity exceeding GPT 3.5. Also, it may be working on an AI-powered chatbot dubbed Apple GPT.\n\nApple might have been suspiciously quiet about AI in product launches. However, it has acquired the greatest number of startups among all tech giants since 2017. The company is likely to have spent around $1 billion in acquiring various AI ventures. In 2023 alone, Apple reportedly bought more than 30 AI ventures. These acquisitions take place mostly to cover various specialties such as self-driving technology, voice design, music generation and image recognition, but sometimes to even acquire the talented individuals behind these startups.\n\nThe latest and most important addition to Apple's AI arsenal is DarwinAI. Acquiring DarwinAI can be seen as an investment in technology as well as personnel, particularly specialists in machine learning and AI from the University of Waterloo. A prominent figure in the AI community and former director at the University of Waterloo, Alexander Wang, is currently appointed as a director at Apple, leading the company's AI efforts in Canada. Also, DarwinAI's synthesis model is expected to help Apple's most ambitious AI capability; on-device AI (also referred to as Edge AI) with plans to move forward with generative AI programs in the future.\n\nTwo recent theses published by Apple have shown the company's effectiveness in incorporating advanced levels of AI within the pre-existing ecosystem. One research paper in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne delves into the development of the MM1 generative AI model. The results of the thesis demonstrate Apple's capabilities in developing cutting-edge AI architectures, particularly multimodal learning, which combines images with text data.\n\nAnother paper published showcases the successful execution of large language models in natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks with limited memory. The methods used in the thesis collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a four to 25 times increase in inference speed compared to other approaches in CPU and GPU. Ultimately, this research paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory to deliver exceptionally faster performance.\n\nBoth these research papers and recent acquisitions indicate Apple is on the right track to offering on-device AI capabilities that will far exceed what is currently available in the market.\n\nUsability focus is Apple's product strategy\n\nVoice Assistant, Facial Recognition, Photo optimization, Personalized recommendations, Animoji and Fitness tracking may look like functions that have nothing to do with AI, but all these features are fundamentally built upon various machine learning technologies. Apple was the pioneering tech brand that managed to integrate these features seamlessly into mobile devices successfully. Today, it is working behind the scenes to improve these features by integrating AI.\n\nWhen Siri, the voice assistant, was released, it was received remarkably well across the globe. But soon after the initial product launch, because of Siri's inability to complete slightly advanced tasks, its credibility declined. Following many internal conflicts faced by Apple's Siri team with engineers frustrated by a lack of tools and data to improve it, the chat bot has started lagging behind its competitors. Meanwhile, Google Assistant, with its superior natural language processing and ability to handle complex queries, and Amazon Alexa, with its vast compatible ecosystem, are gaining momentum.\n\nWith the new on-device AI integration, Apple may have reversed the future of Siri and also could enhance the performance of Apple fitness trackers. The Apple Watch already integrates AI features to enhance fitness tracking. For example, the watch uses machine learning to identify workout types and analyze heart rate data, helping to offer more personalized coaching assistance. However, some competitors offer more advanced AI-powered health monitoring features, including blood pressure monitoring.\n\nKeeping up with its brand of prioritizing the user experience more than anything else, Apple has made its first direct AI-related product with the new MacBook Air with an M3 chip highlighting its capabilities for AI tasks. This can be seen as a major breakthrough in Apple's AI strategy, promising its customers not a cloud-based AI service, but an on-device AI experience that upholds user privacy.\n\nApple follows a pattern of announcing new features as they are coming to the market. Therefore, the upcoming Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June may bring potential AI-related announcements. Speculations suggest AI features will be integrated into the new Mac OS as well as iOS 18. The speculations are further strengthened with Apple acknowledging the term AI in its latest quarterly earnings transcript, deviating from its usual terminology. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the introduction of generative AI software in Apple products later in the year.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of AI-integrated hardware such as Edge AI is expected to have a positive impact on the iPhone upgrade cycle. With the current upcycle period standing at a record high of 4.5 years, users upgrading their mobiles for a better AI-powered user experience will boost new hardware sales. This is crucial for Apple amid four straight quarters of sales declines and the dampening sales numbers in China. Analysts such as Dan Ives and Ben Reitzes believe that with AI integration, Apple will experience another supercycle in smartphone upgrades.\n\nApple's AI gamble - Missing out or playing the long game?\n\nApple may not be as aggressively discussing its AI plans compared to other tech giants, but the company is making steady progress behind the scenes. The company's on-device AI integration strategy may prove to be the differentiator in the future. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26, the stock is valued at a premium to the five-year average of 24. This premium may seem unjustifiable at first, but if the company's on-device AI strategy succeeds, a potential iPhone upgrade supercycle will help it book stellar revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Apple is certainly not missing out on AI despite not joining the hype publicly, yet. Contrarian investors may want to build a position in Apple to potentially benefit from a surprise AI announcement in the coming months.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is wrapping up its two busiest weeks of earnings reports this quarter, with more than half of the index reporting results. Companies have largely surprised to the upside, with the index pacing at earnings growth of 5.5% this quarter, per Evercore ISI.\n\nStock reactions have been mixed, though, as the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than expected hangs over markets and many companies struggle to impress investors given the market's roaring rally going into the reporting period.\n\nBelow we break down some of the key companies that have reported this season.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 10% on the day following its earnings report despite the company missing Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings per share in the prior quarter. Instead of a fundamentals story, CEO Elon Musk caught investor attention with an announcement that the company would accelerate its launch of a low-cost vehicle.\n\nMusk also emphasized the company's role in the AI world, highlighting that the company will be a leader in autonomous ridesharing.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock soared more than 10% after the company announced its first-ever cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion.\n\nThe company's stock surpassed $2 trillion following the report.

(Photo by Julian Stratenschulte/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nMeta\n\nThe Facebook parent company had a different earnings reaction than its tech counterparts. The stock fell more than 10% after the midpoint of itscurrent quarter revenue guidance range came in light compared to the Street's expectations.\n\nSpending was also a key concern among investors, as Meta (META) said it expects the company's full-year total expenses to come in between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a range of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nAcross all of Big Tech, spending was a large focus of quarterly reports as companies announced plans to increase capital expenditures amid the AI spending rush.\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe coffee chain reported a dismal quarter of financial results, missing Wall Street's estimates across the board. Key metrics that came into focus were an 11% decline in China sales (the Street had been expecting a 1.62% decline) and a 6% decline in foot traffic compared to the 0.27% decline the Street had expected.\n\nStarbucks stock (SBUX) fell almost 16% the next day.\n\nJetBlue\n\nThe low-cost airline carrier announced it expects revenue in the current quarter to fall in a range of 6.5% to 10.5%, potentially more than double analyst estimates of a 3.8% drop. Full-year revenue is expected to fall to the low single digits compared to the prior expectation of flat sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nJetBlue stock (JBLU) tanked in reaction, with shares falling almost 20% in the subsequent trading day.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, AMD, Intel\n\nThe magnitude of AI enthusiasm appeared to weigh on stocks in the chip space. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock, which had been up more than 700% over the last year, sank by double digits after the company reported revenue slightly below Wall Street's estimates for the prior quarter. Notably, Super Micro's revenue guidance for the current quarter, which was in a range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, well above Wall Street's estimates of $4.89 billion, wasn't enough to prevent the stock drop.\n\nHigh expectations plagued others in the AI chip trade too. AMD (AMD) topped Wall Street's expectations for revenue and earnings per share in the current quarter, but investors appeared more concerned that the company's Q2 revenue forecast came in lighter than analyst estimates.\n\nA similar story played out for fellow chipmaker Intel (INTC), whose revenue guidance for the current quarter fell short of Wall Street's expectations.\n\nCarvana\n\nCarvana stock (CVNA) soared more than 30% as the company reported a surprise profit for the prior quarter. The company reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 versus expectations for a loss of $0.80. Revenue came in at $3.06 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $2.76 billion.\n\nSnap, Pinterest\n\nShares of Snap (SNAP) jumped more than 30% after the company issued a more upbeat sales forecast than Wall Street had expected. Pinterest (PINS) also saw a significant stock bump after it topped Wall Street's expectations for adjusted earnings per share and revenue in the prior quarter.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "What's in the clouds for Amazon's (AMZN) lucrative AWS business: $100 billion in 2024 sales.\n\n\"This quarter, we just announced a few days ago that AWS did hit the $100 billion annualized revenue run rate milestone — not many tech companies have done that,\" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said on the Opening Bid podcast (video above).\n\nAdded Selipsky, \"I think it's a notable milestone.\"\n\nPowered by voracious demand for generative AI services and the ongoing push to move workloads to the cloud, Amazon's enterprise cloud operation is fresh off a bang-up first quarter.\n\nAWS sales accelerated for the second straight quarter, rising 17% year over year to $25 billion. The business — which Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hired Selipsky to run in 2021 — saw operating profits nearly double to $9.4 billion.\n\nThe division represented about 62% of Amazon's Q1 operating profits.

(Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) (Noah Berger via Getty Images)\n\nSelipsky contends that with 85% of companies still storing their data on-premise, the tailwinds for AWS are just beginning to gust.\n\n\"We're optimistic about the business outlook for AWS and I think it can continue to grow really rapidly. I don't really see an upper limit on it,\" Selipsky says. \"Of course it's not our birthright, it's not guaranteed. We'll only be as successful as what we do tomorrow for customers.\"\n\nThe avid water skier and wine aficionado says he doesn't wake up each day thinking about crushing rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Rather, he spends his time plotting out how to keep customers happy — part of the \"Day One\" culture etched into the company by founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nWall Street believes Selipsky and his AWS team will continue to be the main drivers of Amazon's profits — and stock price.\n\n\"Drivers [of AWS] are strong and sustainable — the ending of cost optimization cycles, core cloud demand, and Gen AI workloads that are amounting to a multi-billion revenue run rate,\" Evercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney said in a client note following Amazon's earnings.\n\nMahaney continued, \"Key is that this marked the first quarter since the third quarter of 2022 that AWS dollar revenue growth surpassed that of [Microsoft] Azure, which changes the cloud industry leadership narrative.\"\n\nSomething else to watch: The tech trade\n\nThe Magnificent Seven trade — Microsoft, Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — has swung back to life amid strong earnings from the aforementioned Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Alert: 7 Must-Buy Stocks When Prices Plunge",
        "content": "A stock market crash isn’t always a bad thing. While people nearing retirement should approach the risk of a crash with more caution, it allows younger investors to buy fundamentally solid companies at more reasonable valuations. We’ll look at some of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nInvestors who capitalize on market uncertainty and load up on top-tier companies can be in a good position after a few years. However, it’s important to know which corporations to consider before a correction or a crash happens. That way, you aren’t rushing to make decisions and can craft a plan leading up to market turbulence. These are some of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a clear leader in the online advertising and cloud computing industries. The corporation’s Q1 2024 results further reflected the company’s vast market share in those industries. Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year while net income jumped by 57% year-over-year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe high net income growth comes as the company implements more cost-cutting measures while accelerating its top-line growth. Continued growth in the cloud and artificial intelligence initiatives can lead to more growth moving forward. Google Cloud in particular has seen rising profits. The segment generated $191 million in Q1 2023. Operating income jumped to $900 million in Q1 2024.\n\nRevenue also grew at a higher pace for Google Cloud. Net sales came in at $9.57 billion compared to $7.45 billion in the same period last year. That’s a 28.4% year-over-year increase which outpaces Alphabet’s overall revenue growth. The stock has a reasonable 26 P/E ratio which should continue to shrink as the company expands its profit margins.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet isn’t the only advertising giant up for grabs. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has also been fulfilling its end of the bargain for investors. The stock has gained 25% year-to-date and is up by an impressive 78% over the past year. It’s also another one of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nThe stock recently plunged after Q1 2024 earnings and is in correction territory. However, the earnings report was solid despite the market’s reaction. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year while net income surged by 117% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s 7% year-over-year daily active user growth across all platforms was also solid. Meta Platforms now has 3.24 billion daily active users. The firm repurchased $14.64 billion worth of shares while distributing $1.27 billion to investors as dividends. Meta Platforms has achieved this level of success while trimming its headcount by 10% year-over-year.\n\nMeta Platforms is making strides in artificial intelligence, but advertising is undoubtedly the main revenue driver. Advertising accounted for $35.6 billion of the company’s $36.5 billion in total revenue. Only 2.2% of the company’s revenue did not come from advertising. If Meta Platforms finds another robust income stream like Alphabet did with Google Cloud, the stock can continue to soar.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) Hotel room\n\nSource: Dragon Images / Shutterstock\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) has built one of the top hotel chains in the industry. The firm has nearly 8,800 properties in 139 countries and territories. Marriott International and its investors have benefitted from the travel boom. Shares are up by 69% over the past five years and trades at a 23.5 P/E ratio.\n\nThe momentum continued in Q4 2023 as the company reported $23.7 billion in revenue. It was a 14% year-over-year increase. Net income grew by 31% year-over-year to reach $3.1 billion. The firm expanded its profit margins and has raised its quarterly dividend payout above pre-pandemic levels. Investors received $0.52 per share in 2023, and the company is expected to announce a dividend hike in May.\n\nThe hotel chain can also benefit as Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) gets more expensive. Airbnb is still a competitor in the hotel industry, but its main appeal in the early stages was more affordable pricing. Now, there isn’t much of a gap between Airbnb and hotel prices, and hotels offer more amenities. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has stated his desire to make Airbnb feel affordable again. As Airbnb gets more expensive, consumers may flock over to hotels more often.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has been attracting younger cardholders while raising its profit margins. The fintech firm trades at 19.5x earnings and has outperformed the market. Shares are up by 26% year-to-date and have soared by 98% over the past five years. It’s another one of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nConsumer preferences change, and some products and services may gain more demand while others may go out of style. However, most individuals will always use credit or debit cards for their purchases. These cards have become a core foundation of economic activity, and American Express has been benefitting from this multi-decade trend.\n\nThe fintech firm reported solid financials in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income jumped by 34% year-over-year. American Express has been expanding its profit margins and wrapped up Q1 2024 with a 16.9% net profit margin.

        "title": "AMZN vs. META: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is Better?",
        "content": "In this piece, I evaluated two of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool below to see which is better. A closer look suggests a bullish view for Amazon and a neutral view for Meta.\n\nOf course, neither company needs an introduction, but Amazon is an e-commerce and cloud-computing giant, while Meta Platforms owns and operates several social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others.\n\nShares of Amazon are up 15% year-to-date and have soared 69% over the last year, while Meta Platforms stock is up 22% year-to-date and 80% over the last 12 months.\n\nAlthough their year-to-date performances are somewhat similar, that’s where the similarities between these two companies end. While both are part of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks, they operate in totally different businesses despite both having a technology bent.\n\nHowever, a closer look at their latest earnings results and the market’s reactions to those reports reveals something very interesting. In short, investors initially rewarded one for spending more on artificial intelligence technology and punished the other for the same thing.\n\nIt seems clear that both Amazon and Meta Platforms could benefit from improved AI technology, but unfortunately, this sort of manic-depressive behavior is commonplace on Wall Street right now. Let’s see if those totally opposite reactions were warranted.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAt a P/E of 50.9x, Amazon is trading at a discount to its five-year mean price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 72.2x. Its forward P/E of about 36.4x is also quite attractive and suggests analysts are projecting significant increases in earnings over the next 12 months. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate, especially considering the cloud computing results in Amazon’s latest earnings report.\n\nFor the first quarter, Amazon reported adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share on $143.3 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of 84 cents per share on $142.5 billion in revenue. Sales in North America rose 12% year-over-year to $86.3 billion, while international sales grew 10% year-over-year to $31.9 billion. Revenues in the cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), surged 17% year-over-year to reach $25 billion.\n\nAmazon’s management guided for second-quarter revenue of $144 billion to $149 billion, which came up short of the consensus estimate of $150.1 billion, and operating income to be between $10 billion and $14 billion. Analysts are also projecting adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share for the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Amazon stock initially dropped after the April 30 earnings release, it recovered quickly, soaring from about $179 before the release to around $185 now. This action is particularly interesting in light of the company’s disappointing guidance, as the Street has typically been punishing companies that come up short of expectations in their outlooks.\n\nHowever, the initial post-earnings drop could have been due to the press release with the disappointing guidance, with the rebound coming after the earnings call. On that call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed the recently achieved $100 billion annual revenue run rate for AWS to their AI-related enhancements.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney also told clients in a note on Tuesday that it was the first quarter since Q3 2022 in which AWS’s total-dollar revenue growth surpassed that of Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. In fact, AWS is becoming more profitable as well, with its operating income jumping 84% to $9.4 billion and its operating margin expanding to 37.6% from 24% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAll of this adds up to a bright future for Amazon, which suggests that it’s meaningfully undervalued at current multiples.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?\n\nAmazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $213.74, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of 18.65%.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\n\nAt its current P/E of about 25.1x, Meta Platforms is trading roughly in line with its five-year mean P/E of about 26.5x. Its forward P/E of 21.6x suggests analysts are looking for a relatively small earnings increase over the next 12 months, but it’s not a significant drop between the current and forward P/E, suggesting a bit more stability rather than soaring earnings to come. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate, especially considering a key piece of the latest earnings report.\n\nMeta Platforms posted its latest earnings results on April 24, reporting adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share on $36.45 billion in revenue versus the consensus numbers of $4.32 per share on $36.15 billion in revenue. However, investors were displeased with the company’s revised outlook, which boosted its expected capital expenditures.\n\nMeta now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion on capital expenditures (capex) this year, up from the previous guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. The company said those increased capex will enable it to speed up its infrastructure investments in support of its AI roadmap.\n\nMeta stock plunged $50 following that release, as investors actually penalized the company for its increased AI spending. However, a key difference from Amazon is that Amazon is already showing results from its AI investments, while Meta is merely planning for future AI enhancements. Of course, Meta has already rolled out some AI enhancements, like its AI chatbot, but it clearly is planning much more with that sizable increase in capex.\n\nAdditionally, Meta’s Reality Labs division continues to report sizable losses, so investors may be concerned about the company’s ability to transform new technologies into profits. In the first quarter, Reality Labs posted a loss of $3.85 billion, bringing its losses to more than $45 billion since the end of 2020.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for META Stock?\n\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $530.93, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies upside potential of 20.2%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on AMZN, Neutral on META\n\nWhile it’s hard to go wrong with Amazon or Meta Platforms, Amazon is the clear winner of this pairing due to its valuation, successful implementation of AI to boost demand, and results from its cloud computing division, AWS.\n\nOn the other hand, Meta’s AI ambitions are incomplete as it significantly boosts spending on AI. As a result, those AI efforts look like a bit of a show-me story, at least until the capital is spent and we see the results of those ambitions. It’s understandable that investors would be concerned about Meta’s ability to turn its new technologies into earnings based on the Reality Labs losses that are piling up.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism",
        "content": "This article looks at beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. If you wish to skip our analysis of over tourism and sustainable travel, please proceed to 5 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism.\n\nUNWTO predicts that destinations around the world will host approximately 1.5 billion international tourists in 2024, the highest volume ever recorded. As wanderlust beckons travelers to traverse through narrow cobblestone streets, dive into underwater shipwrecks, and groove to raucous beats, it comes hand in hand with the threat of overtourism.\n\nOvertourism\n\nOvertourism is essentially the idea of a greater than optimal number of tourists visiting any area. If left unchecked, excessive tourists can have economic, social, and environmental repercussions that impact the longevity and sustainability of any destination. One of the major reasons for overtourism is the availability of cheap accommodation, courtesy of unrestricted house rentals. Companies such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) offer property owners the ability to rent out to tourists for pennies on the dollar, inadvertently causing destinations to become congested with heaps of tourists. Tourists can also utilize groups on Facebook, a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), to obtain informal accommodations.\n\nOther social media sites such as TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram, the latter being operated by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), can both fuel and curb overtourism. Hawaii, one of the places where overtourism is most common, has been forced to take drastic actions, including the removal of a World War II landmark. In April 2024, the Honolulu City Government announced that the island’s famous Haiku Stairs, often referred to as the Stairway to Heaven, would be removed. The decision came as a consequence of illegal trespassing by tourists to visit the stairs, which has only worsened due to social media trends such as #HaikuStairs.\n\nSustainable Tourism\n\nIn response, countries negatively affected by overtourism have begun implementing protocols to limit rental accommodations such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) to regulate tourist inflows. Starting July 2024, Vienna has placed a citywide restriction on house rentals meaning that owners can only rent out units to tourists for 90 days per year. Similarly, in Berlin property owners using platforms such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB) must now obtain permits to rent out their accommodations. These measures are part of a wider effort to make tourism sustainable.\n\nIn addition to governments, corporations around the world have shown increased commitment towards sustainable tourism. Since 2019, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) has been a part of a sustainable travel coalition led by Travalyst. In 2022, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) became a part of the same coalition, demonstrating its devotion to minimizing the negative implications of tourism. Moreover, there is a belief among organizations such as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE) that the next generation of travelers is looking for ways to vacation responsibly.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our research shows travelers are looking for ways to minimize their footprint while traveling and support local communities and cultures, and we see travelers turning to our platform for inspiration and guidance to inform their decisions.”\n\n-Aditi Mohapatra, VP of Global Social Impact & Sustainability, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE).\n\nThis belief is supported by other travel companies, as confirmed in a survey carried out by Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW). The study, in which Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW) surveyed 400 destination management companies in Europe, Africa, and Asia, showed that 84% of providers believe that sustainability is becoming more of a determining factor in how travelers plan their trips. 42% of providers say travelers are actively asking for sustainability options from them, according to Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW).\n\nVacationers are becoming more conscious of how tourists are ruining destinations, with many looking to ensure that no more beautiful places in the world are ruined by overtourism. According to a study carried out by Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG) in 2023, 76% of travelers say they want to travel more sustainably. Our article on Spectacular Floating Hotels Around the World highlights that #SustainableTourism and #ConsiousConsumer have been some of the most viral travel trends on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) websites in recent times.\n\nAs governments, corporations, and vacationers converge in the effort to make tourism sustainable and prevent tourism damaging places of natural beauty, some destinations continue to suffer at the hands of overtourism. If left unchecked, these could be places you’ll no longer be able to visit in five years’ time. To remind ourselves of what we stand to lose, let’s take a look at beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. 20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism\n\n20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism, we began by combing through similar lists on the web. We compiled over 10 notable sources such as The Travel,CN Traveler, and Business Insider, to develop a preliminary list of beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. Using these lists, we developed a scorecard with 2 metrics. The first metric was the frequency of destinations in our sources. The second metric was a ranking factor based on the damage sustained by each place due to tourism. This was scored subjectively by examining news articles, tourist reviews, and reports from relevant authorities & the UN.\n\nIn the scope of this article, damage sustained due to tourism consists of pollution, vandalism, environmental degradation, inflationary impacts, and excessive erosion/ structural damage due to overcrowding. Our ranking factor was then scaled to a number between 0-1. By accumulating the frequency and ranking factors, we calculated our Insider Monkey scores. Once sorted in descending order, the first 20 destinations were selected as beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. Please note that the ranking presented in this article is subjective and based on our assessment criteria. We acknowledge that perceptions of beauty and the impacts of overtourism may vary.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are 20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism.\n\n20. Kyoto, Japan\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 2.3\n\nThe cultural city of Kyoto is famous for its ancient streets, shrines, and temples. Owing to unbridled tourist visits, the city struggled to maintain order, with frequent trespassing on private properties and harassment of local geishas. In response, the government has imposed tourist taxes and penalties for violation of the city’s policies.\n\n19. Hawaii, USA\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 2.9\n\nDue to an overwhelming number of tourists each year, housing and living costs on the islands have soared, preventing locals from being able to afford their homes. Excessive foot traffic on hiking trails and beaches is contributing to a loss of natural beauty and wildlife. There has been significant debate on whether the island should ban, or at least limit, short-term rental accommodations. However, no such permanent measure has been enforced so far.\n\n18. The Great Pyramids, Egypt\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.5\n\nThe only remaining ancient wonder of the world is struggling to cope with mass tourism. The sheer foot traffic of vacationers has caused immense soil erosion and structural damage to the Great Pyramids, making them one of the most beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. In addition, continuous attempts by visitors to scale the pyramids are only worsening the situation.\n\n17. Bali, Indonesia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.6\n\nThe city of Bali is one of the many beautiful places destroyed by pollution, so much so that in 2017 authorities declared a “trash emergency” due to an abhorrent amount of plastic waste being dumped on its popular beaches. As of 2024, the Bali Provincial Government has imposed a tourist tax of 150,000 Rupiah to combat overtourism.\n\n16. Cozumel, Mexico\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3.8\n\nThe island of Cozumel is one of the most popular beaches in the world, especially among cruise tourists. However, scuba diving and cruise ships have damaged much of the coral reefs that lie below its azure waters. Despite this, Cozumel hosted over 1.6 million tourists in the first quarter of 2024, although some of the diving sites have been closed in an effort to sustain its coral population.\n\n15. Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon, Iceland\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.1\n\nThis majestic canyon was featured in HBO’s Game of Thrones and Justin Bieber’s music video I’ll Show You, after which there was a sharp rise in tourists visiting the area. Over fears of damage to its natural beauty, the canyon was fenced off in 2019, however, tourists continue to illegally enter the canyon, increasing the risk of it becoming a beautiful place in the world ruined by overtourism.\n\n14. Stonehenge, UK\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.4\n\nThe neolithic structure was severely compromised as tourists chipped fragments of the structure as souvenirs. For several decades, tourists have been banned from entering the stone circle, however, it is still one of the most overcrowded spots on the planet.\n\n13. Great Wall, China\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4.6\n\nAccording to National Geographic, approximately 30% of the Great Wall is crumbling into ruin. Natural erosion, foot traffic, and development projects are all factors that have made this destination a beautiful place ruined by overtourism. Since 2019, a cap of 65,000 daily visitors has been imposed.\n\n12. Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.6\n\nAmsterdam is one of the cities in Europe that have imposed stringent policies on rental accommodations to combat overtourism. Currently, Airbnb rentals are limited to 30 nights a year per property, and property owners have to obtain a permit before renting out any accommodation, with any subsequent income being subject to taxation.\n\n11. Angkor Wat, Cambodia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.7\n\nGraffiti and foot traffic to the temple have made it one of the most beautiful places in the world ruined by overtourism. In addition, a shortage of water supply has caused the water table to drop significantly, which in turn puts the soil underneath the city at risk of sinking.\n\n10. Boracay, Philippines\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5.8\n\nConsidered one of Asia’s most overrated travel destinations, Boracay Island has suffered immensely from both overcrowding and its subsequent pollution. In 2018, the island’s popular tourist spots were sealed for six months. Since then, there has been an effort to make tourism sustainable which has faced fierce opposition from those struggling to maintain their livelihood.\n\n9. Mount Everest, Nepal\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.5\n\nThe last place on earth you would expect to witness a traffic jam would be the slopes of Mount Everest, but that is where mass tourism has brought us. Even more appalling are the piles of garbage and litter left for local sherpas to collect. Between 2019 and 2023, 110 tons of waste were collected in a Mountain Cleanup Campaign, and this cleanup is expected to resume in 2024.\n\n8. Dubrovnik, Croatia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.6\n\nThe Old Town area of the city featured as King’s Landing in HBO’s Game of Thrones, causing a huge influx of tourists into an already congested space. The increase in foot traffic and cruise visitors threatened to cause irreparable damage to the ancient structures, after which the city has placed a cap on the number of cruise ships and visitors allowed to enter the city.\n\n7. Barcelona, Spain\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6.7\n\nHosting one of the largest ports in the Mediterranean, Barcelona hosts cruise ships all year round. Apart from inflated housing prices, mass tourism places a strain on the city’s public transport and waste management. Recently, the city has increased its tourist tax to €3.25 to ensure this beautiful place isn’t ruined by overtourism.\n\n6. Rome, Italy\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 7.6\n\nMany of Rome’s most popular sites, such as the mighty Colosseum have suffered at the hands of mass tourism, with graffiti and burglary of stones being rampant. Similarly, the city’s famous Spanish Steps were embellished by wine stains and dried gum, so much so that the city banned tourists from even sitting on the steps in 2019.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in Florida That You’ve Never Heard Of 12 Most Hated Countries in Europe 15 Tax-Friendly Countries To Consider for Your Retirement\n\nDisclosure: none. 20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook took time during the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday to drum up excitement for the iPhone maker's upcoming generative AI offerings.\n\nIn his remarks, Cook told listeners that the company is bullish about the opportunities generative AI has to offer and that it is making significant investments in the technology.\n\n\"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration; groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry leading neural engine; and our unwavering focus on privacy,\" Cook said.\n\nAhead of the call, Apple reported better than anticipated earnings and revenue, though iPhone sales fell about 10% year-over-year. Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 15 Pro during an Apple event on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nApple will host its annual WWDC developer conference in June, which should serve as the launchpad for the company's generative AI ambitions. Analysts hope generative AI could kick off another iPhone sales supercycle. But, so far, the technology doesn't appear to be driving sales of competing smartphones from the likes of Samsung and Google.\n\nCook has been relatively tightlipped regarding Apple's generative AI plans, dropping small tidbits about the company's investments here and there. This is one of the first times he's come out so strongly about how Apple will set itself apart from its Big Tech rivals in the generative AI space.\n\nWall Street is waiting on tenterhooks for Apple's generative AI announcements. The company hasn't debuted any generative AI products since the technology exploded in popularity in late-2022.\n\nRivals including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, have rolled out a series of generative AI capabilities and products including chatbots and search engine improvements. Microsoft, in particular, has added generative AI directly to Windows 11 via the Windows 11 Copilot.\n\nIf Apple's generative AI plans are going to live up to Wall Street's expectations, it will need to enable some kind of must-have features that users can't get on their existing devices. We'll find out what Apple's cooking up next month. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "25 Most Profitable Companies in the US",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the US. If you want to skip our overview of the US economy and the current business climate, you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\nWith the second quarter of 2024 with us, Wall Street is focused on determining whether companies that are investing in AI are actually bringing in money or whether they are investing costly capital to set themselves up for future growth. Firms that belong to the former sector, i.e. those that are making money from AI, have been rewarded as has been the case with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Just like NVIDIA is Wall Street's favorite AI stock when it comes to semiconductors needed to power up large data processing software, Microsoft is the king of the jungle when it comes to AI software. In the latter segment, the best example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares have dropped after the latest earnings report revealed that 2024 will require an additional $40 billion in capital to fund AI growth.\n\nThis sharp eye on AI comes when investors are grappling with an economy that might be starting to slow down just as the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to tamp down on inflation. While the AI gold rush of 2023 put inflation and other macroeconomic indicators on the backdrop, after the inflation data for March 2024, they are back in the spotlight. This environment, which has left investors eager to flee away from stocks once again comes as profitability becomes key, particularly as profits are important to enable firms to position themselves for growth (such as is the case with AI stocks) or keep investors happy by paying out dividends.\n\nUS companies are also some of the biggest in the world when it comes to profits. America's corporate sector, particularly the technology industry, is the most developed in the world. Firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are able to compete with the world's largest state owned enterprises when it comes to revenue. In fact, Apple is the first company in the world that has proven that technology and personal computing is a more lucrative industry than oil - a commodity that is responsible for powering daily lives. To understand how, consider that Apple's trailing twelve month revenue as of December 2023 sits at a whopping $385 billion.\n\nNow, compare this with the net sales of the Saudi state owned oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), which has raked in SAR2 trillion during the same time period. Using an exchange rate of 3.75 SAR to a dollar leads to approximately $530 billion in revenue for the Saudi oil giant. While naturally, Aramco's revenue is higher since it does not have any comparable competitors on a global level, the fact that a consumer technology firm that is dependent not only on the need to stay abreast with innovation but also with what its rivals are doing is able to earn more than half of the revenue is something in itself to say the least.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a whole, Insider Monkey also looked at the 30 Largest Companies in the World by Revenue. This shows that US companies reign supreme even though Aramco enjoys free access to the vast global crude oil market. The US retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) tops this list courtesy of its $648 billion in sales, showing that a well run privately owned company has the full potential to take on massive state owned giants.\n\nBut what about profits? After all, even if a firm makes hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, its investors get nothing if money does not flow through the income statement and into retained earnings. Today, we'll look at some of the most profitable companies in America, with a couple of top picks being Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 25 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\nPhoto by Christian Dubovan on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most profitable companies in the US, we ranked all publicly listed US firms by their trailing twelve month net income available on Yahoo Finance and picked out those with the highest profit.\n\n25 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\n25.

        "title": "Top 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 by Index Weight Right Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by index weight right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the flagship stock index and some recent news for its biggest constituents then you can skip ahead to Top 10 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now.\n\nThe S&P 500 plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, politics, and the finance industry. This is because it is one of the most widely followed barometer of the economy, with investors and finance professionals using its data to inform their daily decision making. For politicians, a rising index means that they can boast to voters for having managed the economy well. For finance professionals, they can rest easy knowing that the pricey bets that they might have made on the stock market are doing well.\n\nWhen compared to other indexes, the S&P 500, managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), is particularly important because of the stringent conditions that a firm must meet to be included in it. For starters, only sizeable large cap stocks, or those with a market capitalization greater than $18 billion can be included in the index. These large cap stocks must also be highly liquid, generate most of their revenue in America, and of course, be profitable. These criteria remove most firms that might not do well financially, and as a result, the S&P is also recommended as a great passive investment.\n\nShifting to its performance, 2024 has been a fireworks filled year for the S&P 500. The index is up by 6.9% year to date, after it also crossed the illustrious 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history. In fact, year to March 28, 2024 the index had marked 11% in gains, but it ended up losing these after the inflation data for the month led to investors significantly revising their Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations for 2024.\n\nIn April, while the index did end up revaluing itself in the wake of shifting rate cut paradigms, the first quarter of 2024 earnings season marked by Wall Street's enduring focus on artificial intelligence seems to have injected some life into it. The season, at least as far as artificial intelligence and technology stocks are concerned, started by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sharing its latest financial performance on April 24th. Meta's results led to tens of billions of dollars in market value being wiped out as investors didn't take too well to $40 billion in AI spending for 2024 at a time when expenses were growing. These were followed by results from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which were more favorably received. If anything, the latest earnings reports have at least stopped the S&P 500 from bleeding further losses, and right now, Wall Street is focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of April.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this meeting is not expected to yield a rate cut, the focus, as always, is on comments made by the Fed after its meetings. These comments help set the tone for future monetary policy actions, and traders will also focus on earnings from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to see whether there's any juice left for more growth. Google parent Alphabet's earnings came with a nice surprise for investors in the form of a dividend, and Wall Street is now focused on whether Amazon will follow suit.\n\nHowever, while the economic picture on the surface might point to fewer Fed interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 might surprise by posting gains if the central bank overshoots market expectations or considers economic weakness more strongly than expected. Just what might force the Fed to swing the other way despite hot inflation and labor costs? Olivia Micklem of Artemis Investment has some insights:\n\nObviously we can see with the data that's been coming through in recent weeks that inflation continues to run hotter than we would have liked to see at this point in the year. That being said, alongside that we are starting to see pockets of weakness in the economy whether that's parts of the consumer economy and other parts of the industrial complex. We got some softer number out of some of the trucking companies last week, for example. So there are indications that some parts of the economy are slowing down. I think we still remain you know cautiously optimistic that there could be an opportunity as we move through the year for the Fed to stay on track with some of their plans to start bringing rates down.\n\nSo, with the S&P 500's future remaining as dynamic as ever, we decided to look at which stocks have been assigned the highest weights by its managers. A few notable ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 5 Reasons Why Millionaires Think They’re Middle Class\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the top S&P 500 stocks by weight, we used the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a proxy and verified the data by the S&P's limited publicly available information about the S&P 500's top ten stocks.\n\nTop 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now\n\n25.

        "content": "Companies have clearly defined goals: to grow their customer base, brand power, and global influence, compete with giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and join the shortlist of trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nWhile this sounds great, reaching a trillion-dollar market cap is a tough mountain to climb. Companies on their way to this peak should offer superior products that their clients love and adapt to the market’s continuously evolving needs.\n\nLike anyone wanting to enjoy a comfortable retirement, I, too, would like to own companies that give me that potential. So, in this article, I’ll shortlist three buy-rated companies that I think have the potential to reach the trillion-dollar milestone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo come up with the list, I screened for the following criteria:\n\nCompanies nearing $1 trillion market cap/valuations Buy-rated stocks Double-digit quarterly or yearly revenue growth year over year (according to the latest reporting period)\n\nI then sorted the results from farthest to closest based on their proximity to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a leader in infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a rich history and a reputation as the global leader it is today. With roots from its predecessor, Ma Bell, Broadcom has made its mark as one of the top “go to” companies for cybersecurity, distributed software, mainframe, data management and networking solutions.\n\nBroadcom has further cemented its foothold in the tech sector with its recent acquisition of VMWare, which helps it virtualize desktop operations systems, modernize its customer’s private and hybrid cloud environments, and reach its goal of becoming the world’s number one infrastructure technology firm. Speaking of modernization, Broadcom also has strong connections to AI with its networking products and AI accelerators for AI data centers that solidify its trajectory for growth.\n\nWith a market cap north of $560 billion, I won’t blame you for saying it’s a tad early to think it will reach the trillion-dollar mark anytime soon.\n\nHowever, Broadcom has a strong portfolio of services that can help it cross the finish line.\n\nIts finances aren’t bad either, with Q1 2024 revenue growing 34%.\n\nAccording to AVGO stock’s strong buy recommendation, analysts also appear optimistic about the company’s prospects as one of the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is one of today’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Its specializes in oncology, neuroscience, immunology and diabetes medications. Eli Lilly’s strong list of products — Humulin, Cymbalta, Adcirca, Yentreve, and the widely popular Mounjaro and Zepbound — propelled it to greater heights.\n\nWith its market cap currently around $712 billion, Eli Lilly is close to reaching the trillion-dollar milestone thanks to its growth products, promising pipeline, and phase 2 trials of tirzepatide in treating NASH.\n\nThe company’s fiscal year 2023 financials also boasted a 20% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong customer reception of its new products. The company also has a promising outlook with GAAP EPS, which is expected to reach $11.80 to $12.30, and revenue of between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion.\n\nCombine this with the strong buy recommendation from Wall Street experts, and we may have a recipe for another trillion-dollar success.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile almost everyone knows its billionaire owner, Warren Buffet, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) may not be as popular with non-investors. Its operations are structured as a holding company for its subsidiaries in various sectors.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s main strategy focuses on holding stakes in leading companies and buying undervalued businesses that can be derived from its proven and effective value investing philosophy. A recent example is its acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in Pilot Travel Centers LLC from Pilot Corporation (OTCMKTS:POGHF), which has complete ownership.\n\nOf the three on our list, Berkshire Hathaway is the closest to reaching the trillion-dollar milestone, with its market cap around $899 billion.\n\nThe company’s upward trajectory is mostly due to its growth. FY 2023 saw an impressive 21% growth in operating earnings. Net earnings reached $96 billion — a great recovery from last year’s $23 billion loss.\n\nNo wonder analysts like those at UBS main Berkshire Hathaway’s buy rating. Its strong management and investment philosophy rooted in Warren Buffet’s value investing principles, which have proven effective for the company, makes it one of the next potential trillion-dollar stocks to make history.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But for those developing the technology, the AI battle is proving costly,” he wrote in a note dated Thursday.\n\nThe Facebook-owner spooked investors last week when it revealed that it will spend billions of dollars more than expected this year — driven by investments in AI. The strategic pivot seemed to have caught some investors by surprise because the company had embraced aggressive cost-cutting in recent quarters to boost profit.\n\nSlowinski’s contrarian calls have found success in the past: Amazon.com Inc. stock fell about 24% in the time he had an underperform rating on the e-commerce giant between 2022 and 2023.\n\nAmazon was and remains the most-loved stock on Wall Street, attracting at least 68 buy-equivalent ratings through Wednesday’s close.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Warning: Don’t Get Caught Holding These 3 Social Media Stocks",
        "content": "The National recently reported a declining number of listed companies on the U.S., U.K. and European stock markets.\n\nDespite record high share prices, the supply of stocks is dwindling due to bankruptcies, private ownership and fewer new listings. The U.S has about 5,000 fewer listed companies than expected for an economy of its size. At the same time, the U.K. has lost 25% of its companies in the last decade. This spells doom for these social media stocks to avoid. Capital seems to be flowing out of the traditional stock market and into other ventures. Those include private equity, which could accelerate in the event of a stock market crash.\n\nWith a small number of social media stocks left over, only the strongest will survive. After all, they compete for a limited pool of dollars from investors. One should then consider abandoning their speculative bets and stick to the blue-chip options.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo let’s delve into three social media stocks to avoid now.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) owns Snapchat, a messaging app known for its disappearing messages and augmented reality (AR) filters. The company has struggled to achieve sustainable profitability. It faces tough competition from Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) Instagram and TikTok.\n\nThe brand’s competitive issues have made it challenging for Snap to secure a larger share of the digital advertising market. And while Snap has grown its user base and revenues, it has yet to build a sustainable business model.\n\nSNAP is still a relatively small fish in the market compared with Meta or its key rivals. Its market cap is just $24 billion. Furthermore, analysts project that its revenue year-over-year (YOY) increases will slow down after fiscal year 2025.\n\nTherefore, SNAP will either be in the crosshairs of big tech as an acquisition target or a rival to trample. We can see how Meta has absorbed Whatsapp and Instagram into its fold beforehand. In reality, SNAP may not have the resources to compete in the long-run.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is largely a relic from the mid 2000s. Yet, it has managed to stay relevant even in today’s world. I also see PINS as a potential acquisition target.\n\nRecently, Pinterest reported strong first quarter 2024 results, with a 23% revenue growth reaching $740 million. Additionally, it showed a record 518 million global monthly active users (MAUs), up 12% YOY. Despite a GAAP net loss of $25 million, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $113 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nPinterest’s Q2 of 2024 guidance forecasts revenue in the range of $835 million to $850 million, representing an 18-20% YOY growth.\n\nHowever, there are some issues that I don’t think PINS can overcome easily. First, it trades at an absurdly high P/E at 152 times sales. This is due to the brand just recently breaking even. Its forward measures are lower, but this is assuming that it will continue its record earnings streak. And I feel it is too risky to rely on this.\n\nMore time needs to be given to PINS to prove itself as a stable earner. Otherwise, it’s one of those social media stocks to avoid.\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) the match group (MTCH) logo displayed on a phone screen next to a heart\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) owns several popular online dating platforms, including Tinder, Match.com and Hinge. While online dating continues to grow in popularity, Match Group faces challenges such as increasing competition from free dating apps, changing consumer preferences.\n\nRecently, CNN reported that the dominance of Tinder in the dating app market is declining, with annual downloads decreasing and paying users falling by 8% last year.\n\nHowever, dating apps like Bumble, Grindr, Hinge and OkCupid remain popular, with downloads more than doubling since 2012. Bumble’s downloads are on track to surpass Tinder’s.\n\nAnd, while young adults under 30 are the primary users of dating apps, they are also forming romantic relationships offline more frequently than older generations.\n\nAs social media users and communities have grown, they have also become more niched-down and decentralized from each other. Alt-tech sites like Gab and extremely niche communities such as Ravelry, which caters to knitters, underscore this.\n\nTherefore, I don’t believe that MTCH has a durable competitive advantage to justify an ongoing raise in its valuation, especially as many consider the “peak” of online dating being far from over.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The metaverse may have gotten off to a rough start, but don’t write it off just yet. Instead, you may want to consider buying some of the top metaverse stocks today.\n\nSure, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still losing money on it, but it’s not giving up on it either. In fact, META is now associating its metaverse plans with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n“Fueled by mainstream tech giants’ attempts to make metaverse popular in a Web2 fashion and technological advancements—such as high-speed internet and smartphones becoming tiny supercomputers—metaverse is expected to become a $5 trillion business by 2030,” as noted by CoinTelegraph.com.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs we wait to see what’s next on the horizon, let’s explore some top metaverse stocks you may want to buy and hold.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nMetaverse stocks like Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) have been beaten up recently, but it’s still a solid buy opportunity.\n\nFirst, the company issued better-than-expected quarterly results, with an even better outlook for the fiscal year. True, it lost 52 cents in the fourth quarter, as bookings climbed 25.3% higher to $1.13 billion year-over-year (YOY). Analysts were looking for a loss of 55 cents on bookings of $1.08 billion.\n\nSecond, RBLX expects its Q1 bookings to come in between $910 million and $940 million. That’s above expectations for $902.6 million. For the full year, it expects bookings to come in between $4.14 billion and $4.28 billion. That’s above expectations for $4.06 billion.\n\n“Roblox said it expects its top line to grow by at least 20% each year through 2027. Roblox also said that it is targeting between 100 and 300 basis points of margin expansion each year as the company moderates spending. The company cited its ability to manage growth in fixed costs, including headcount,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could see even more upside with the AI and metaverse boom. After climbing to a high of $967.66, it’s now back to $830.41. This weakness could be a long-term opportunity. From that last traded price, I’d like to see NVDA run well above $1,000 a share this year.\n\nTD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay says NVDA is his “top pick” with a price target of $1,100.\n\n“Checks continue to indicate strong demand” for Nvidia’s market-dominating artificial intelligence chips, even as the company increases its ability to supply that demand through (calendar years) 2024 and into 2025,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In the near term, the analyst says fiscal Q1 2025 should see Nvidia produce total revenue of $24.8 billion, of which a staggering $21.3 billion (86%) will come from the datacenter (which at this point means basically the AI chip) division. Assuming this is the right revenue number, it will equal 245% year-over-year growth, and 12% sequential, quarter-over-quarter growth,” as noted by TipRanks.com.\n\nRoundHill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Colorful arrows pointing at the multicolored word \"ETF\" against a cement surface\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/eamesBot\n\nWe can also diversify at a low cost with the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF is the world’s largest metaverse fund and should benefit from two key areas of growth. That includes “The Metaverse’s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion,” as noted by RoundHillInvestments.com. “VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.”\n\nSince bottoming out at the start of 2023, the METV ETF ran from a low of about $7 to a high of $12.48. It has since pulled back to $11.87, which signals an opportunity. From its current price, I’d like to see it run back to $17 near term. Even better, the METV ETF is starting to pivot higher from overextensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "JPMorgan Just Cut Its Price Target on These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Research by brokerage firms and investment banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are helpful in guiding investors through the complex landscape of Wall Street. Their analysts evaluate stocks, considering factors such as market trends, company fundamentals and economic indicators. Therefore today, we discuss JP Morgan price target cuts on three stocks that were issued following the recent earnings releases.\n\nThis analysis by JPMorgan suggests that these stocks may be overvalued and poised for a potential downward trajectory. Thus, if you own or are thinking of buying any of these shares, you may want to consider doing more due diligence. With that information, here are three JPMorgan price target cuts.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nWall Street’s love of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has put increased focus on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the first of our JPMorgan price target stocks. Since reporting earnings on Apr. 24, Meta shares have come under pressure and are now trading at multi-month lows. The light revenue forecast, increased spending, and concerns about profitability were among the factors that contributed to the plunge in Meta’s shares and average price target cuts by analysts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, this reaction overshadowed the company’s positive first-quarter 2024 results, which surpassed analyst expectations. Meta reported a 27% year-over-year (YOY) increase in revenue, reaching $36.46 billion. This increase marks the company’s fastest quarterly revenue growth rate since 2021. Net income also doubled YOY, rising to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share.\n\nHowever, investor sentiment focused on Meta’s conservative revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter. Management projected sales for the second quarter on average of $37.75 billion, falling short of analyst estimates of $38.3 billion. Additionally, concerns about Meta’s increased spending on non-profitable areas such as AI and mixed reality, contributed to the decline in shares.\n\nDespite the recent sharp fall in shares, META stock has enjoyed a strong year-to-date rally of over 20%. Meanwhile Meta’s valuation appears stretched at over 32 times forward earnings and 8 times sales. Yet, Wall Street history shows us that that price declines in mega-caps like Meta Platforms do not typically last for long. Interested investors should do more diligence and keep an eye on the $400 level for potentially buying the dips in META shares.\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWe continue our discussion of companies about JP Morgan price target cuts with Prologis (NYSE:PLD), a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Management focuses on strategically located logistic facilities, such as warehouses, near major transportation hubs like seaports, airports, and highways. This proximity allows businesses to efficiently receive, store, and distribute goods.\n\nThe REIT reported mixed financial results for the first quarter of 2024 in April. Net earnings per diluted share were 63 cents for the first quarter of 2024 compared with 50 cents for the first quarter of 2023. Core funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share was $1.28 for the quarter, compared with $1.22 for the same period in 2023.\n\nInvestors raised eyebrows as the logistics warehouse operator adjusted its 2024 guidance downward. This move reflects a potential moderation in the previously robust warehousing demand. Management acknowledged several factors contributing to this shift, including rising interest rates, a more cautious retail environment, and geopolitical uncertainties. Prologis also noted that these factors are prompting companies to adopt a more conservative approach to leasing decisions.\n\nAs a result, Prologis stock fell and is now hovering slightly above the 52-week low of $96.64 last seen on October 2023. Despite a 22% year-to-date decline, PLD stock still remains overvalued at around 45x forward earnings and 12x sales. While the shares yield an attractive 3.7% dividend, long-term investors may still want to wait before hitting the “buy” button on Prologis.\n\nSilicon Laboratories (SLAB) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe final pick among JPMorgan price target cuts is the fabless semiconductor business Silicon Laboratories (NASDAQ:SLAB). The company is known for silicon-based devices, software, and related intellectual property used in a wide range of electronic products. Silicon Laboratories focuses on mixed-signal and analog-intensive integrated circuits, catering primarily to the Internet of Things (IoT) market. SLAB provides wireless microcontrollers, sensors, and software development tools for connected devices used in smart homes, industrial automation, and other IoT applications.\n\nThe semiconductor company reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024 that fell short of expectations. Revenue declined 57% YOY to $106.4 million. Net loss came in at $56.5 million, a sharp reversal from a net profit of $14.0 million in the same period last year. This translated to a loss per share of $1.77, compared to earnings per share of 44 cents in the prior-year period.\n\nAdding to investor concerns, management’s guidance for the second quarter was cautious. The company anticipates a diluted loss per share ranging from $1.45 to $1.61. This bleak outlook, coupled with the stock’s already stretched valuation with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.1, prompted a price target cut by JPMorgan. SLAB shares have declined 7% YTD but increased volatility on Wall Street may lead to further downward pressure.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Daily Mirror publisher Reach has revealed a further hit to online revenues due to the ongoing fallout from moves by the likes of Facebook to de-rank news on its platforms.\n\nThe group – which also owns the Express newspapers, the Daily Star and regional newspapers across the UK – revealed that page views plunged by a third year-on-year in the first quarter after “major platforms” de-prioritised news last year.\n\nOverall, digital revenues fell 8.5% in the first three months of 2024, although this was better than the 14.2% fall seen in the previous quarter.\n\nFirms such as Facebook owner Meta moved last year to prioritise user-generated content above news on their social media sites, which has hit traditional media groups hard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Reach said the impact was partially offset in the first quarter by strengthening yield per page, while it said the year-on-year fall in so-called referral traffic from social media platforms will also “lessen as we progress through the year”.\n\nThe group’s update showed overall group revenues fell 6.7%, with print revenues down by 6%.\n\nIt said sales from newspaper circulation was proving a “predictable and reliable revenue stream”, with turnover down by a more muted 3.4% after it hiked cover prices.\n\nAdvertising revenues for its print titles remained under pressure, down 10.7% in the quarter.\n\nBut the group stuck by its guidance for underlying full-year earnings of £97.6 million, up from £96.5 million in 2023.\n\nShares in the group lifted 9% in Thursday morning trading.\n\nReach is cutting costs in the face of trading pressures, having reduced the number of workers it employed last year by 14%.\n\nIt also cut production volumes of newsprint as part of efforts to make savings and said in its latest update that it was “confident” in delivering its target to reduce costs by 5% to 6%.\n\nJim Mullen, chief executive of Reach, said cost cutting moves were “driving results”.\n\nHe added: “This gives me confidence that we can continue to navigate current market conditions.\n\n“With events like the European Football Championships, Olympics and elections round the corner we have the opportunity to generate high levels of interest by entertaining and informing our audiences.”",

        "content": "mirror\n\nThe publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers has posted a drop in revenues for the first quarter as changes to Facebook’s algorithm hit its page views.\n\nReach reported an 8.5pc fall in digital revenues in the first three months of the year, which it blamed on the “well publicised” deprioritisation of news across social media platforms.\n\nUnlike publications with a subscription-based business model such as The Telegraph, Reach relies on advertising income, meaning changes in traffic from social media can greatly affect its revenues.\n\nFacebook, which is owned by Meta, has begun downgrading news articles on its platform, while it is winding down deals to pay publishers and has shut down its news tab entirely.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwitter has also taken steps to deprioritise news, including by removing headlines from articles, as boss Elon Musk tries to keep users on the website.\n\nReach, which relies heavily on social media for referrals, said the changes meant its page views had slumped by a third year on year. The publisher has previously branded Facebook a “potent threat to civil society”.\n\nThe publisher, which also owns regional titles including the Liverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News, is battling to turn around its fortunes as it struggles to adapt to the digital era.\n\nBoss Jim Mullen slashed around 800 roles last year, including many in Reach’s editorial department, in a bid to shore up its finances.\n\nThe news organisation is trying to gather more data on its readers in an effort to improve its offering to advertisers, as well as for ecommerce and affiliate marketing.\n\nReach said data-driven revenue made up 45pc of its digital revenues in the first quarter, up from 39pc in the same period last year.\n\nBosses also said print newspapers remained a “predictable and reliable” revenue stream, though Mr Mullen has previously said they could become loss-making in as little as five years.\n\nPrint advertising revenues slumped 11pc in the first quarter, while circulation was down around 3pc. Overall revenues fell 6.7pc.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares rose 6pc in early trading.\n\nReach said it was on track to make cost savings of between 5pc and 6pc and said it was expecting a boost to traffic from upcoming events including the Euros, Olympics and US and UK elections.\n\nMr Mullen said: “We have set the business up to succeed – the decision to take cost action early, alongside the continued implementation of the customer value strategy, is delivering a growing yield performance and driving results.\n\n“This gives me confidence that we can continue to navigate current market conditions.”",

        "content": "The discovery of tens of thousands of racy advertisements for artificial intelligence-generated \"girlfriends\" across Meta apps prompted the social media giant to scrub its platforms of the explicit content in recent days.\n\nAn investigation by Wired published last week found more than 29,000 instances in Meta's ad library of ads for \"AI girlfriend\" apps on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. The ads were for chatbots that engage in sexually explicit messaging and feature AI-generated images of scantily-clad women in suggestive positions. A report that found more than 29,000 ads for \"AI girlfriend\" chatbots on Meta's platforms prompted a crackdown by the company.\n\nThe report said more than half the ads included the acronym \"NSFW,\" which means \"not safe for work,\" warning people that it is not suitable to view the content while at a place of employment.\n\nZUCKERBERG SAYS PAYOFF FOR META'S AI PUSH COULD BE A FEW YEARS AWAY\n\nWired said the ads appear to violate Meta's policies prohibiting adult content, and said around 2,700 of the ads were active when it contacted Meta about the issue the week prior. Meta is scrubbing Facebook, Instagram and Messenger of ads for \"AI girlfriends\" that feature AI-generated images of scantily-clad women.\n\n\"When we identify violating ads we work quickly to remove them, as we’re doing here,\" Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels told the outlet. \"We continue to improve our systems, including how we detect ads and behavior that go against our policies.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nMETA ROLLS OUT UPGRADED AI ASSISTANT ACROSS FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP\n\nDaniels supplied the same statement Wednesday when contacted by FOX Business, and added that Meta reviewed the ads and is removing them for violating its adult content ads policy.\n\nMeta prohibits ads containing adult content, including \"nudity, depictions of people in explicit or suggestive positions, or activities that are overly suggestive or sexually provocative.\"\n\nThe Meta spokesperson also said the company often sees instances of groups or individuals taking on new tactics to avoid detection and evade its policies and enforcement, which is why they are constantly evaluating and updating their approach.\n\nOriginal article source:Ads on Facebook, Instagram for explicit 'AI girlfriends' prompt Meta crackdown\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Q1 Earnings Seasons Picks &amp; Pans: The 4 Biggest Stock Winners (and 3 Losers)",
        "content": "We’re a little more than halfway through first-quarter earnings season, so now is the time to review this earnings season winners and losers. In general, market results have been encouraging so far. Forty-six percent of companies listed on the S&P 500 have reported their quarterly results. Seventy-seven percent beat forecasts with their earnings or profits, while 60% announced better-than-expected revenue or sales. That’s quite good considering it comes amid reports that the economy is slowing and inflation remains stubbornly high.\n\nOf course, not every company has hit it out of the park with their Q1 results. Many companies have missed expectations or offered weak forward guidance, sending their stocks down as a result. Each day is filled with headlines of stocks that are plunging after companies disappointed analysts and investors, erasing billions from market capitalizations.\n\nSo, which companies have come out ahead and which have tanked with their Q1 financials? Let’s take a look at some of this earnings season winners and losers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWinners: Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is hands down the biggest winner of the Q1 earnings season so far. GOOGL stock rose 14% immediately after the company reported blowout first-quarter earnings, declared its first dividend payment and announced a new $70 billion stock buyback program. It was a triumph among tech companies and led to the entire stock market rising. On June 17, Alphabet will pay its stockholders a cash dividend of 20 cents per share, with promises of more to come.\n\nBeyond the dividend and stock buyback, Alphabet reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.89 versus $1.51 that was expected among analysts. The Q1 profit was up 57% from a year earlier. Revenue from January through March totaled $80.54 billion compared to $78.59 billion that had been estimated. Sales in Q1 increased 15% from a year ago, the fastest rate of growth in two years. Much of the success was driven by a rebound in online advertising after two years in the doldrums.\n\nGOOGL stock has now increased 54% over the past 12 months.\n\nDomino’s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant chain Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) also had a very good Q1 print, sending its stock up 6% as a result. The company’s first-quarter financial results beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. Domino’s reported EPS of $3.58, well ahead of the $3.40 consensus expectation of analysts. Profits were up 22% from the previous year. Revenue came in at $1.08 billion, which was slightly above Wall Street forecasts. Sales rose 6% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino’s attributed the strong financial results to accelerating sales at its more than 20,000 outlets worldwide. The company is executing its “Hungry for More” growth strategy that aims to open 1,100 new stores by 2028, increase retail sales by 7% a year and grow operating income by 8% per year. Indications are that Domino’s is succeeding with its plan. Same-store sales increased 5.6% at the company’s U.S. locations in Q1, beating 1% growth at its international outlets. Growth was driven largely by higher delivery orders.\n\nDomino’s has also relaunched its loyalty rewards program to better engage with lower-frequency customers. The program now has 33 million active members. During Q1, Domino’s opened 164 new restaurants, all but 20 of which are situated overseas. The company also repurchased $25 million worth of its own stock during the quarter.\n\nDPZ stock has gained 67% in the last 12 months.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) are up 5% after the pharmaceutical company reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit and raised its forward guidance as sales of its popular weight-loss drugs takeoff. The company announced EPS of $2.58 versus $2.46 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter missed analyst targets, coming in at $8.77 billion compared to $8.92 billion that was forecast. Despite the miss, sales were up 26% YOY.\n\nLooking ahead, Eli Lilly said it now expects full-year earnings of $13.50 to $14 per share, up from previous guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 a share. The company expects full-year revenue of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion, which is an increase of $2 billion at either end of the range. Analysts had expected full-year earnings of $12.50 a share and sales of $41.44 billion. Growing sales of blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight-loss drug Zepbound are driving results at Eli Lilly.\n\nThe latest earnings included the first full quarter of Zepbound sales. The drug, which was approved by U.S. regulators last autumn, reported $517.4 million in Q1 sales. Some analysts have forecast that Zepbound could post more than $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market, and that it might become the biggest selling drug of all time.\n\nLLY stock has increased 92% in the last 12 months.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf the economy’s slowing, someone forgot to tell American Express (NYSE:AXP). The credit card giant reported strong first quarter profits as its customers continue to spend on shopping, dining out and travel. Of course, American Express benefits from the fact that its clients tend to be more affluent and their spending holds up better than most during economic downturns. American Express said that its cardholder spending increased 7% from a year ago during Q1 of this year.\n\nThe credit card company reported EPS of $3.33 compared to $2.95 that was anticipated by analysts. Revenue in Q1 totaled $15.8 billion which matched Wall Street expectations. Sales were up 11% from a year earlier. Billed business, which represents the transaction value on American Express credit cards, rose 6% during the quarter to $367 billion. In terms of guidance, American Express maintained its previous revenue growth forecast of 9% to 11% and a profit estimate of $12.65 to $13.15 per share for this year.\n\nAXP stock has gained 46% in the last 12 months.\n\nLosers: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA little more than halfway through Q1 earnings season and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) looks like the big loser. META stock plunged 16% after the technology company delivered forward guidance that disappointed investors and outlined plans to continue spending heavily on new products, notably related to artificial intelligence (AI). CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth dropped by $18 billion in one day after the Q1 print. Ironically, Meta’s outlook overshadowed what were otherwise strong quarterly results.\n\nMeta reported EPS of $4.71, exceeding the $4.32 that was expected among analysts who track the company. Earnings more than doubled from $2.20 a share in the previous year. Revenue in the quarter totaled $36.46 billion compared to $36.16 billion expected on Wall Street. Sales were up 27% from a year earlier, representing the fastest rate of growth since 2021. Sadly, the company’s guidance fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. Growing investments in mixed reality and AI also didn’t sit well with analysts and investors.\n\nMETA stock has fallen 15% since the Q1 print was delivered. However, the share price is still up nearly 84% in the last 12 months. Depending on how you look at it, META has managed to be one of the earnings season winners and losers.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) can’t seem to catch a break. Despite launching an aggressive growth strategy, the Golden Arches continues to report substandard quarterly results. The company just announced mixed Q1 figures, which it blamed on consumers pulling back on discretionary spending and boycotts at its restaurants in the Middle East. The Chicago-based restaurant chain reported EPS of $2.70 versus $2.72 that was expected among analysts. Revenue amounted to $6.17 billion compared to $6.16 billion that was forecast.\n\nOverall, sales at McDonald’s increased 5% in Q1. Although global same-store sales rose 1.9% during the January through March period, that growth missed estimates of 2.1%. During their earnings call, management acknowledged that higher menu prices have pushed some customers away. McDonald’s also noted that its restaurants in the Middle East have been hurt by the Israel-Hamas conflict and related boycotts in that region. Earlier in April, McDonald’s bought the 225 restaurants operated by its Israeli franchisee.\n\nMCD stock has declined 8% over the past 12 months.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted strong Q1 results. However, NFLX stock fell 9% after its latest print was made public because it announced that it will no longer report quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per membership. Management said they are halting the reporting of subscriber numbers as they want investors to instead focus on metrics such as revenue and free cash flow. Investors took the news badly, with some claiming it’s a sign that subscriber growth is slowing.\n\nControversy over the reporting of subscriber numbers overshadowed the fact that Netflix reported EPS of $5.28 compared to $4.52 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $9.37 billion versus $9.28 billion that was estimated among analysts. As for subscribers, Netflix reported a grand total of 269.6 million at the end of Q1, ahead of expectations for 264.2 million and up 16% from a year earlier. Management warned though that subscriber growth in the current second quarter will be lower than in the first due to what they called “seasonality.”\n\nNFLX stock has fallen 9% during April, but the share price is up 72% over the last 12 months. Like META, NFLX’s numbers make it both one of the earnings season winners and losers\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GOOGL and LLY.

        "content": "Not everyone is feeling good about the stock market. Inflation has been picking up, and interest rates have remained elevated. Earnings reports for tech companies have been good for the most part, but that doesn’t mean the market will remain attractive over the next few years.\n\nTime in the market beats timing the market. However, some corporations look unlikely to outperform the S&P 500 or deliver meaningful long-term gains for investors. Holding onto unprofitable stocks can bring your portfolio down. These blue chip stocks do not look promising for long-term investors.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nAt first glance, things look good for the House of Mouse. Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares are up 24% year-to-date and outperformed the stock market. Unfortunately, a wider lens will reveal significant underperformance, such as a 16% drop over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe activism buzz contributed to Disney’s year-to-date gains, but that campaign has concluded. Investors will have to look deeper into Disney’s underlying business; recent financial results weren’t good.\n\nRevenue increased by less than 0.5% year-over-year in Q1 FY24. Diluted EPS was a bit better, going from $0.70 to $1.04 per share. That’s a 48.6% year-over-year increase, but investors shouldn’t expect that growth to continue if revenue stays flat. Most of the company’s net income growth came from cost reductions.\n\nEntertainment revenue dropped by 7% year-over-year, while revenue from Sports and Experiences was up by 4% and 7% year-over-year, respectively. Streaming can be profitable in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, but the stock has run up too quickly.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) has fallen off its pedestal. The stock is only up by 10% over the past five years, including a 25% drop over the past year. Supply chain concerns, inventory glut, and more competitors have put the stock in a corner.\n\nNike reported revenue that was “slightly up” in Q3 FY24. “Slightly up” is code for 0.31% year-over-year revenue growth. Furthermore, net income declined by 5.5% year-over-year. The athletic apparel company trades at a 28 P/E ratio. Nike’s valuation is currently higher than Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and close to Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) valuation. That doesn’t make much sense. Nike’s valuation is also similar to its growing competitor, Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), which also doesn’t seem reasonable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn economic slowdown can put further pressure on Nike and its high prices. Competitors can swoop in with more affordable products that are still high quality. It’s been a tough few years for long-term investors. Although the stock offers a 1.57% dividend yield, the 5-year gains look bad.\n\nCisco (CSCO) cisco (CSCO) logo on an office building\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a mature networking hardware company. It has a cybersecurity component through its recent Splunk acquisition. Long-term investors haven’t been too pleased with Cisco as it has been down by 13% over the past five years. The stock has a 14.5 P/E ratio and a 3.34% yield, which looks good on the surface. However, revenue and net income are both decreasing.\n\nRevenue decreased by 6% year-over-year in Q2 FY24. Meanwhile, GAAP EPS dropped by 3% year-over-year. These decreases are taking place during a period of economic strength. Other tech companies are reporting solid earnings, but we haven’t seen that with Cisco.\n\nThe stock seems destined to underperform the stock market, and it’s not the best pick leading up to a correction or a crash. Cisco is down by 5% year-to-date and only has a 3.40% compounded growth rate for its dividend over the past five years. It seems like Cisco is doing the bare minimum with its dividend hikes, which isn’t good for investors who want elevated cash flow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMarc Guberti is a finance freelance writer at InvestorPlace.com who hosts the Breakthrough Success Podcast.

        "title": "Lawsuit against Meta asks if Facebook users have right to control their feeds using external tools",
        "content": "AP Technology Writer (AP) — Do social media users have the right to control what they see — or don't see — on their feeds?\n\nA lawsuit filed against Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is arguing that a federal law often used to shield internet companies from liability also allows people to use external tools to take control of their feed — even if that means shutting it off entirely.\n\nThe Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Meta Platforms on behalf of an Amherst professor who wants to release a tool that enables users to unfollow all the content fed to them by Facebook’s algorithm.\n\nThe tool, called Unfollow Everything 2.0, is a browser extension that would let Facebook users unfollow friends, groups and pages and empty their newsfeed — the stream of posts, photos and videos that can keep them scrolling endlessly. The idea is that without this constant, addicting stream of content, people might use it less. If the past is any indication, Meta will not be keen on the idea.\n\nA U.K. developer, Luis Barclay, released a similar tool, called Unfollow Everything, but he took it down in 2021, fearing a lawsuit after receiving a cease-and-desist letter and a lifetime Facebook ban from Meta, then called Facebook Inc.\n\nWith Wednesday's lawsuit, Ethan Zuckerman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is trying to beat Meta to the legal punch to avoid getting sued by the social media giant over the browser extension.\n\n“The reason it’s worth challenging Facebook on this is that right now we have very little control as users over how we use these networks,\" Zuckerman said in an interview. \"We basically get whatever controls Facebook wants. And that’s actually pretty different from how the internet has worked historically.” Just think of email, which lets people use different email clients, or different web browsers, or anti-tracking software for people who don't want to be tracked.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Wednesday,\n\nThe lawsuit filed in federal court in California centers on a provision of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which is often used to protect internet companies from liability for things posted on their sites. A separate clause, though, provides immunity to software developers who create tools that \"filter, screen, allow, or disallow content that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lawsuit, in other words, asks the court to determine whether Facebook users' news feed falls into the category of objectionable material that they should be able to filter out in order to enjoy the platform.\n\n“Maybe CDA 230 provides us with this right to build tools to make your experience of Facebook or other social networks better and to give you more control over them,” said Zuckerman, who teaches public policy, communication and information at Amherst. “And you know what? If we’re able to establish that, that could really open up a new sphere of research and a new sphere of development. You might see people starting to build tools to make social networks work better for us.”\n\nWhile Facebook does allow users to manually unfollow everything, the process can be cumbersome with hundreds or even thousands of friends, groups and businesses that people often follow.\n\nZuckerman also wants to study how turning off the news feed affects people's experience on Facebook. Users would have to agree to take part in the study — using the browser tool does not automatically enroll participants.\n\n“Social media companies can design their products as they want to, but users have the right to control their experience on social media platforms, including by blocking content they consider to be harmful,” said Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight Institute. “Users don’t have to accept Facebook as it’s given to them. The same statute that immunizes Meta from liability for the speech of its users gives users the right to decide what they see on the platform.”\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI investments are showing signs of a payoff, but the price is steep",
        "content": "Tech earnings season is in full swing, and while a handful of notable players still need to report, namely Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), there’s one key throughline running through the announcements so far: It’s taking a lot of money to make money on AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), four of tech’s biggest AI players, have each called out AI sales growth, though without many specifics, while pointing to increased spending on capital expenditures to meet AI demand.\n\nMicrosoft announced last week it spent $14 billion on capital expenditures tied to its AI buildout in its fiscal third quarter, up from $7.8 billion in the same period last year. The company’s 2024 capital expenditures have already eclipsed its spending across all of 2023, and there’s still another quarter left in its fiscal year.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet said it spent $12 billion in the last quarter and will continue at that pace for the rest of the year. Meta similarly said it’s cranking up spending for the full year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion. And CFO Susan Li said that number will increase in the year ahead as well.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Amazon said it would blow past last year’s $48.4 billion in capital expenditures, saying the $14 billion it spent in Q1 will be the low for the year.\n\nThose are mountains of cash. And while there are early signs that AI is driving revenue growth, it’ll take time before it truly makes an impact on companies’ bottom lines.\n\n“I'm thinking it's a 12- to 18-month investment period before we start to see a lot of this really pay off big time,” TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\nTesting the AI waters\n\nGenerative AI is still a relatively new technology. Sure, it blew up in 2023, but corporations are slow-moving entities, and many are only starting to try out generative AI applications across their business segments.\n\n“If I sign up for Microsoft 365 with Microsoft, do I sign up all of my 100,000 employees or do I sign up 500 to check it out?” O’Donnell asked, adding that companies are starting out with a smaller number of signups to get a sense of how they can best use AI applications on the job before signing up the rest of their employees.\n\nThat’s not necessarily a bad thing for tech companies. During its earnings call last week, Microsoft said AI accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth in its Azure and other cloud services business. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter and 3 percentage points in the quarter before that. In Q4 last year, the company said AI drove 1 percentage point of growth in Azure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while it might seem like growth is falling off precipitously, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said it was more the result of a lack of available AI capacity. In other words, Microsoft didn’t have the resources needed to meet customer demand.\n\nGoogle CFO Ruth Porat noted a similar increase in AI sales during her company’s earnings call, saying that Google’s Cloud Platform saw increasing revenue contributions from AI, though she didn’t provide an exact number.\n\nFor Amazon’s part, CFO Brian Olsavsky said customers continue to sign up for larger and longer deal commitments for Amazon Web Services, with many adding generative AI components.\n\nSpending won’t slow down anytime soon\n\nIt might take a year or more to start seeing AI-based revenue growth truly take off, but that doesn’t mean companies are going to ease up on spending. According to Forrester analyst Rowan Curran, companies have been pouring money into AI technologies for years; generative AI has just supercharged that spending.\n\n“We saw a huge growth and investment over the past … year and 18 months, but this has been a continuous increase over the past, I would say, eight or 10 years,” he said. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg presents new devices and AI offerings at the Meta Connect developer conference. (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nAnd tech companies are preparing investors for the long road ahead. During Meta’s earnings call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to assuage concerns that the social media giant will need to plow cash into its AI efforts, though it largely fell on deaf ears, as shares tumbled 14% the morning after the announcement.\n\nHood, meanwhile, said that Microsoft will continue to push AI spending, with levels likely to be the same as those in the company’s fiscal 2025 as they’ve been throughout its fiscal 2024.\n\nOlsavsky offered a similar outlook for Amazon, saying that the company will plow money into generative AI services.\n\n“We will be meaningfully stepping up our capex and the majority of that will be … to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts,” he said during the company’s earnings call.\n\nNow companies just have to prove all of that spending is paying off and provide the numbers to match.

        "content": "Amazon's Smashing Q1 Financials Show The Power Of A Good And Well Executed Strategy\n\nLike Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL),  Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with stronger than expected revenue being the result of the improvements on the ad business front.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nIn part due to its booming AWS division and its advertising service, Amazon reported revenue grew 12.52% YoY to $143.3 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $142.5 billion. Operating income far outpaced revenue growth as well as it soared more than 200% to $15.3 billion, which is the first sign that Amazon’s cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are benefiting the bottom line as net income skyrocketed 229% YoY to $10.43 billion, with diluted EPS amounting to 98 cents a share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 83 cents.\n\nAmazon’s businesses are thriving, beginning with party seller services that cover commissions that Amazon collects, along with fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew 16% YoY to $34.5 billion.\n\nAWS continues to grow and challenge Google and Microsoft, both the cloud and AI front.\n\nThe AWS division reported a 17% YoY growth to $25 billion, surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $24.5 billion and reflecting Amazon’s strong positioning compared to its AI rivals, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), who secured a leadership position with its early entry and OpenAI acquisition, and Alphabet, with the latter finally catching up to its peers in their efforts to lead the way into the golden age of AI.\n\nAWS’ actions could spell trouble for Alphabet and Microsoft as Jassy revealed significant investments over the next few years to build new infrastructure and data centers. Amazon will be investing $5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia and $5 billion in Mexico to build new infrastructure centers, along with $10 billion in Mississippi to build two data centers that are projected to create at least 1,000 jobs.\n\nAdvertising continues to grow, becoming an increasingly important profit driver.\n\nAdvertising revenue grew 24% to $11.8 billion, outpacing both retail and cloud computing growth, as well as StreetAccount’s estimate of $11.7 billion. This is the first report since Amazon introduced ads in Prime Video, which analysts expect to generate significant revenue over time. Despite being new to the ad business, Amazon has emerged as one of the big players in the online advertising arena. CEO Andy Jassy has made it clear that the e-commerce and cloud titan will continue to focus on its ad efforts, as it plans include more of its sponsored content on its Prime Video platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst quarter results across the board show that online ads have rebounded. Last week, Alphabet also announced its ad business reaccelerated after a tough 2022 and 2023. Google reported total ad sales rose from last year’s comparable quarter, when they amounted to $54.55 billion, to $61.66 billion.\n\nSecond Quarter Outlook\n\nAmazon expects profitability growth to continue in the current quarter but at a more measured pace as it guided for an operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, on the back of revenue in the range between $144 billion to $149 billion, translating to revenue growth in the range between 7% and 11%.\n\nAmazon’s disciplined focus on efficiency is showing results.\n\nCost-cutting across the board, fulfillment operations tweaks and stabilization of cloud spending all partially contributed to the earnings growth as Amazon focused to grow its most profitable services, including advertising, cloud computing, Prime memberships and its third-party marketplace.\n\nAmazon continues to stand out among its Big Tech peers as it is yet to implement a quarterly dividend. In February, Meta announced its first dividend at 50 cents a share. Last week, Alphabet followed the footsteps of Meta as it announced its first ever dividend of 20 cents a share.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Top 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 technology companies in Silicon Valley. If you want to skip our coverage of the world's technology hub and a region that has changed the world as we know it, then check out 5 Top Tech Companies in Silicon Valley.\n\nIf there's one thing that 2024 has made sure it's that Silicon Valley isn't going anywhere. The sector that gave us the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone is now leading the charge with a set of technologies called artificial intelligence. Typically the domain of science fiction, AI is a collection of techniques that fall under the category of data science. It is the most advanced kind of data science there is, as the software is programmed to learn from voluminous data sets to generate and create insights of its own.\n\nThe close of the first quarter of 2024 also provided Wall Street the ability to take stock of where some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most of which are in Silicon Valley, are when it comes to artificial intelligence. Big ticket technology and AI companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) report their earnings for the first quarter of 2024. These results primarily focused on the costs that the companies had incurred for their AI platforms in Q1 and also their plans for further spending this year.\n\nOne of the first firms to report its earnings was the Facebook parent Meta. Its shares tanked by 16% in aftermarket hours on the day of the earnings report, as Wall Street digested a multi billion dollar AI capital expenditure plan for 2024 and saw costs grow for the first time after two consecutive quarters. Alphabet sought to assure investors of its stability, as it became yet another technology stock to declare a dividend. An additional source of income is almost always welcomed by investors, and Alphabet's shares soared by more than 10% in aftermarket, even as its peer Microsoft demonstrated mixed share price performance despite being one of the strongest performers on the artificial intelligence front.\n\nDelving deeper into Silicon Valley giant Alphabet's earnings, the firm known for being Google's parent, announced a 20 cent dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback. Both of these are great for helping the share price, and since its earnings report, Alphabet's stock is by 6% after shedding some of its 10% gains in post earnings gains during regular trading hours. On the revenue front, Alphabet brought in $80 billion while it raked in $1.81 on the EPS front. Both of these beat analyst estimates that had stood at $78.59 billion and $1.59, and coupled with $61.7 billion in advertising revenue that surged past estimates of $60.2 billion meant that the latest set of results was rather well rounded.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the hardware side of things, Intel, which is one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is currently focusing on the leading edge side of the industry. The firm has lost its chip manufacturing race to the Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and in April 2024, it announced the 'first light' for the world's most advanced chip making machine, a high NA EUV scanner. First light refers to the first time that a chip making machine is turned on, and the event typically marks the end of countless hours of work spent in setting up the complex machines.\n\nAs for AI, here's what the management of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), another Silicon Valley firm, had to say during its Q1 2024 earnings:\n\nWe’re bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we are already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We are driving strong usage, value and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top technology companies in Silicon Valley.

        "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last week. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. In fact, the share price is 127% higher today. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now.\n\nSince the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 13%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Meta Platforms managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 18% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 80% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 18% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nStocks tumbled into the close on Tuesday, a fitting end to the year's most challenging month for investors.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 4% while the Dow (^DJI) lost 4.5%, marking its worst month since September 2022.\n\nAnd much of this reversal was driven by the winners who got us here in the first place.\n\nThe three US stocks with the biggest market cap gains in the first three months of the year — Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) — suffered the biggest losses to their market caps in April.\n\nNvidia was up a cool $1 trillion in market cap as of the final trading day of March, of which it gave up over $85 billion in April — the third-biggest such loss in the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft, the first quarter's silver medalist, added over $330 billion. But it subsequently lost over $210 billion in April.\n\nThen there's Meta Platforms, which turned in a similar performance to Microsoft, gaining nearly $330 billion through March before losing just over $140 billionin April.\n\nApril had its share of winners, too, with these names also marking a reversal from what predominated in the year's first quarter.\n\nTesla (TSLA) gained over $25 billion in April, putting it in second place for the month after coming in next-to-last in the first quarter with a loss of $230 billion.\n\nApple (AAPL) was sitting dead last among US stocks at the end of March with a year-to-date market cap loss of nearly $350 billion. After the close on Monday, it had gained over $30 billion in value over April, but a day later — at month-end — that gain had dwindled to $2 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) took first prize, gaining nearly $150 billion in the month. All of this and more came the day after it reported first quarter earnings last week, logging a 10% gain, which was good for $197 billion of market cap.\n\nThese big names also demonstrate how moves across sectors showed similar trends of reversion, with gains and losses swapping places.\n\nInformation Technology (XLK) — the home of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple — was the No. 1 large-cap gainer in market cap through March, rising $1.5 trillion. It was also the biggest loser in April, falling over $650 billion.\n\nCommunications Services (XLC) — home of Alphabet and Meta — was third in first quarter gains, adding $570 billion in market cap. It fell to the middle of the pack when it comes to April losses, losing nearly $100 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY) — home of Amazon and Tesla — was dead last among sectors in the first three months of the year, only to drop $180 billion in April.\n\nNotable April losses also include Financials (XLF), down $275 billion, and Health Care (XLV), which lost over $280 billion.\n\nThe only sector to gain in April was Utilities (XLU), which has also been the biggest laggard of this bull market that began in October of 2022.\n\nApril's plot twists still appear to be corrections, rather than shifts, in the narrative. Meta, for instance, may have lost well over $140 billion in value over the month of April, but shareholders are still sitting on annual gains of over 20%.\n\nTuesday's rocky close comes right as the proverbial \"sell in May and go away\" headlines are set to trigger. Astute investors understand that market seasonality is a nuanced phenomenon. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Stocks to Sell: 3 Earnings Disasters to Ditch Before It’s Too Late",
        "content": "As is always the case, earnings season is a mixed bag. Companies that surprise on the upside and issue bullish guidance are seeing their share price rise 10% or more in a day. Companies that miss forecasts and offer a downbeat outlook are seeing their stock slide 10% lower or more in a single trading session. While much of the ups and downs are due to instant overreactions on the part of investors, there are some companies whose problems look serious and should be on your list of stocks to sell.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings growth is coming in better-than-expected as we near the halfway point of the current reporting season. Q1 earnings growth is now at 5.6%, exceeding analyst forecasts of 4.3% growth, according to data from LSEG. With 229 of the companies listed in the benchmark S&P 500 index having reported financial results, 78% have beaten Wall Street estimates. That said, 22% missed expectations and many of those stocks now look like duds. Here is stocks to sell: three earnings disasters to ditch before it’s too late.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) actually had a very good Q1 print. However, the company’s guidance and spending on new artificial intelligence (AI) projects spooked analysts and investors, sending META stock down 10% and wiping $18 billion off CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth. For Q1, Meta reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 versus $4.32 that was expected among analysts. Earnings more than doubled from a year ago. Revenue totaled $36.46 billion compared to $36.16 billion expected. Sales were up 27% from a year earlier.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the Q1 numbers were strong, the guidance was another matter. Meta said that it expects sales in the current second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. The midpoint of the projected range, $37.75 billion, would represent 18% annualized growth. Unfortunately, the revenue outlook fell short of the consensus estimate of $38.3 billion among analysts. The selloff in META stock accelerated as Zuckerberg talked about growing investments in AI. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be $40 billion.\n\nWith META stock having nearly doubled over the last 12 months, now might be a good time for shareholders to sell.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) continues to struggle post-pandemic. The largest shipping and logistics company in the U.S. reported mixed Q1 financial results as demand for shipments of small packages slumped between January and March of this year. UPS reported EPS of $1.43, which topped Wall Street forecasts of $1.30. However, revenue in Q1 amounted to $21.70 billion, below estimates of $21.80 billion. UPS said that cost controls partly offset subdued demand for small package delivery.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also reported a 3.2% decline in average daily shipping volumes in its domestic segment and a 5.8% decrease in its international unit. In January, the company announced 12,000 job cuts, a move that will save it $1 billion this year, as demand continues to soften following a shipping boom experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic. UPS is also grappling with a new labor contract with the Teamsters union that has hurt its margins. The company said it is absorbing 46% of the new wage and benefit costs in 2024.\n\nUPS stock is down 18% over the past 12 months, making it a stock to sell after earnings.\n\nChevron (CVX) CVX stock\n\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil major Chevron’s (NYSE:CVX) Q1 print showed the continued pressures facing companies operating in the energy sector. The leading oil and natural gas producer reported a profit decline due largely to lower margins at its refineries. Specifically, Chevron reported EPS of $2.93 versus $2.87 that was expected among analysts. The oil major’s profit fell 16% from a year ago. Revenue missed the mark, coming in at $48.72 billion compared to $50.66 billion that was forecast on Wall Street.\n\nChevron attributed the declining profit to lower sales margins at its refineries and lower natural gas prices due to excess global supply. Natural gas prices have declined 37% this year due to a supply glut caused by warm winter weather around the globe. Also, retail margins for gasoline – the difference between the retail and refining prices – has decreased in recent months. Chevron’s refining business in the U.S. saw earnings plummet 50%. Profits in international refining were worse, falling nearly 60%.\n\nCVX stock is down 2% over the last 12 months and trailing the market. Investors who don’t already own shares in the company should hold off for now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "My 5 Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "It's easy to get swept up in the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Some of the predictions experts are making won't come true. On the other hand, they could be underestimating the changes AI could bring in some ways. That's how it's always been in the early days of a game-changing technology.\n\nMake no mistake, though: AI is a game-changing technology. And it presents what almost certainly is a once-in-a-generation investing opportunity. There are many good choices for investors, but a few especially stand out. Here are my five favorite AI stocks to buy in May, listed alphabetically.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nUnderestimate Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) at your peril. Sure, the company has had a few missteps with its launches of generative AI models. However, Alphabet remains one of the leading innovators in AI with a boatload of cash to invest in research and development.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai boasted recently that Google has \"the best infrastructure for the AI era.\" While that's debatable, he could be right. Thanks to the AI explosion, Google Cloud is unquestionably well-positioned to deliver tremendous growth.\n\nBut could AI render Google Search obsolete? I don't think so. Pichai noted that Google's testing has found increased search usage and higher user satisfaction among people who use its new AI overviews. He stated the company has \"clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud as well as subscriptions.\" I agree.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is another AI pioneer with plenty of room to run. Some might have thought the company would be left behind in the AI race after OpenAI took the world by storm with ChatGPT. If so, they were proved wrong.\n\nLast year, Amazon rolled out wave after wave of new AI technology. As a result, Amazon Web Services (AWS) appears to be in a strong position to maintain its position at the top of the cloud services market. As more AI apps are deployed in the cloud, AWS should grow much larger.\n\nAmazon is also using AI to improve its internal efficiency and help customers. I expect these efforts will continue to show up on the company's bottom line.\n\nFounder Jeff Bezos instilled the mindset that it's always \"day one\" at Amazon (i.e., the company will always think and act like a start-up). With AI, it really is \"day one\" at Amazon.\n\n3. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) might be the most surprising pick on this list. The chipmaker has lost the mojo it once had, losing market share to rivals with less expensive solutions and missing out on the GPU boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, I predict Intel will make a big comeback. The company at long last has some of its swagger back. Intel recently introduced a new AI chip to compete head-to-head with Nvidia, the industry's 800-pound gorilla.\n\nIntel's shares trade at a super-low price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.5, according to LSEG. Even if analysts' growth projections incorporated into this valuation metric are way off, Intel is one of the cheapest AI stocks on the market.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nInvestors bailed on Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) after the company's recent first-quarter update. Meta didn't report disappointing numbers; its revenue and earnings looked great. Instead, the company's projection of higher expenses due to AI and metaverse investments and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's focus in the earnings call on these current money-losing initiatives caused the sell-off.\n\nI think this negative reaction to Meta's update was short-sighted. Zuckerberg mentioned in the Q1 call that the company has experienced significant volatility in the past when it was still in the early stages of investing in new technology. He noted, though, that investors who didn't throw in the towel were rewarded over the long term. I suspect we'll see this pattern play out with Meta's investments in AI and the metaverse.\n\nLike Alphabet and Amazon, Meta is using AI to boost the monetization of its social media platform. The company is also integrating AI into business messaging and smart glasses. I view Meta as a potential sleeping giant (that's really not sleeping) in the AI world.\n\n5. UiPath\n\nI'm not completely biased toward huge AI stocks. UiPath's (NYSE: PATH) market cap is only around $11 billion. This relatively small size is an advantage, in my view.\n\nUiPath is a leader in robotic process automation software. It uses AI extensively throughout its platform. One of the company's AI products even ranked among Time's Best Inventions of 2023.\n\nSince mid-2022, UiPath's annualized revenue run rate has increased by a compound annual growth rate of 32%. The company achieved profitability in its latest quarter. Even though it's been in business for nearly 20 years, UiPath is still only in its early innings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

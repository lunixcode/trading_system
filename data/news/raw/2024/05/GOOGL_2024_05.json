(5:40) - Tracey’s Top Stock Picks For Your Watchlist (23:00) - Episode Roundup: MOD, ETN, GOOGL, MSFT, SMCI Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #371 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nNVIDIA recently reported earnings and the company talked about the “AI revolution.” Stock investors are eager to get into this trade, but the stocks have rallied big over the last year.\n\nIf you’re a value investor, you may be on the sidelines thinking that all of the AI stocks are just too expensive to even consider. But Tracey believes ALL investors should have some exposure to this new industry. However, that doesn’t mean she thinks you need to buy an expensive stock to get it.\n\nTrees don’t grow to the sky and no stock goes higher for forever. Even the mighty NVIDIA has had pullbacks and sell-offs in the last year during its incredible rally. There have been buying opportunities.\n\nValue investors should look for pullbacks and sell-offs in these stocks. They always come.\n\nWhat’s an “AI Stock”?\n\nThere are companies in several different industries that are currently considered “AI stocks.” The most well known is in the chips. NVIDIA has a lock on that market, for now.\n\nBut those chips go into data centers. Companies that are involved in the build-out, or servicing, of the data centers are also “AI stocks.”\n\nAnd then there are the companies doing business in generative AI. These are the companies using all that data that is at the data centers.\n\nIt takes a lot of electricity and other utilities, like cooling, to keep the data centers operational so there are “old economy” companies that are now “AI stocks.”\n\nAnd it won’t stop there. The AI industry will expand as the ecosystem builds out. But, for now, these are the most prominent areas to invest in.\n\n5 of the Cheapest AI Stocks to Buy Now\n\n1. Modine Manufacturing (MOD)\n\nModine Manufacturing has been involved in thermal management since 1916. Talk about “old economy.” In fiscal 2024, Modine’s data center business increased 69% year-over-year.\n\nShares of Modine Manufacturing have soared 61% year-to-date but it’s still attractively priced, with a forward P/E of just 27.\n\nShould a mid-cap company like Modine Manufacturing be on your AI stock watch list?\n\n2. Eaton Corp. (ETN)\n\nEaton is in power management. Founded in 1911, it has paid dividends every year since 1923. That’s as “old economy” as you can get.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut shares of Eaton are up 36% year-to-date to new highs as it’s now an AI stock. It’s not cheap, however. Eaton trades with a forward P/E of 32 and a P/S ratio of 5.7.\n\nShould power management companies like Eaton be on your watch list?\n\n3. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is known for advertising and for some of its products like YouTube. It has been deploying generative AI to roll out new products, including on Google Search.\n\nShares of Alphabet are up 21.8% in 2024 to new all-time highs. However, Alphabet remains one of the more attractive AI stocks due to its low P/E. No, Alphabet isn’t trading under 15x earnings, but it’s still attractive at 23x.\n\nCould Alphabet be one of the cheapest of the AI stocks?\n\n4. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft was among the first to roll out generative AI features in its products. As a result, investors have pushed up the stock to new highs. Microsoft shares have gained 7.9% year-to-date, but are off recent highs.\n\nMicrosoft is expensive at these levels. It is trading with a forward P/E of 35. But another indicator of value, its price-to-sales ratio, is also at sky-high levels at 13.5. A P/S ratio over 10 is considered high.\n\nShould Microsoft still be on your watch list at these valuations?\n\n5. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer provides service and storage solutions in cloud and data centers. It’s been one of the hottest AI stocks of the last year. Shares of Super Micro Computer are up 172% year-to-date.\n\nBut shares have pulled back over the last 3 months. Super Micro Computer has fallen 14.6% during that period. And while it trades with a forward P/E of 35, because of its incredible growth, Super Micro Computer has a PEG ratio of just 0.7. A PEG ratio under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both growth and value.\n\nIs this weakness a buying opportunity in Super Micro Computer?\n\nWhat Else Should You Know About Cheap AI Stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT and GOOGL in her personal portfolio.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 26% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 15.7%. The company is benefiting from strong momentum in Google Services segment on the back of search, YouTube and Android. Hence, Alphabet’s Google is constantly making efforts to bolster the segment further.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Google’s latest roll-out of “Minimized Custom Tabs” for Google Chrome on Android remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThese tabs shrink webpages into Picture-in-Picture windows featuring site favicon, page name and domain, enabling multitasking and seamless transition between native apps and web content.\r\n\r\nThe custom tabs are expected to improve the user experience and functionality of the Chrome browser, which, in turn, will likely increase the company's web browsing traffic.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction among Android users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nOther Google Services Efforts to Note\n\nAlphabet added generative AI features, namely “Tab Organizer” and a theme maker, to Chrome 121. The Tab Organizer feature automatically creates tab groups based on open tabs by tapping the downward-facing icon in the top-left corner on Windows. The theme maker feature allows users to create custom themes in Chrome using a generative AI text-to-image diffusion model, offering six suggested options and recent creations.\r\n\r\nThe company added a Gemini shortcut in Google Chrome’s address bar, allowing faster search through bookmarks, history and tabs.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also introduced an Incognito mode in Google Chrome, which allows users to browse the web without any trace, removing browsing history and tracking data after closing the browser, a feature that some interpret as private browsing.\r\n\r\nGoogle is developing a built-in \"Listen to this page\" text-to-speech capability for Chrome on Android. The users will get a new \"Listen to this page\" option, which will open on Android’s three-dot overflow menu, launching a mini-player with a circular play/pause button, page title, site name, progress bar and close button.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nPer a Dataintelo report, the global search engine market size is expected to reach $507.4 billion by 2032, indicating a CAGR of 11% between 2024 and 2032.\r\n\r\nGrowing Chrome capabilities will continue to aid Google in strengthening its foothold in the global search engine market.\r\n\r\nA report from GlobalStats states that Google continued to enjoy its dominant position in the global search engine market, with a market share of 91.5% in 2023.\r\n\r\nStrength in Google’s search business will continue to drive growth in the Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Google Services segment increased 13.6% year over year to $70.4 billion, which accounted for 87.4% of the total revenues.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $295.53 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.2%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.61 per share, indicating a 31.2% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.5% in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Badger Meter BMI and Dropbox DBX, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nArista Networks’ shares have gained 30.6% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for ANET is 15.68%.\r\n\r\nBadger Meter’s shares have gained 27% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for BMI is currently projected at 15.57%.\r\n\r\nShares of Dropbox have declined 22.6% in the year-to-date period.

        "title": "Google makes fixes to AI-generated search summaries after outlandish answers went viral",
        "content": "Google said Friday it has made “more than a dozen technical improvements” to its artificial intelligence systems after its retooled search engine was found spitting out erroneous information.\n\nThe tech company unleashed a makeover of its search engine in mid-May that frequently provides AI-generated summaries on top of search results. Soon after, social media users began sharing screenshots of its most outlandish answers.\n\nGoogle has largely defended its AI overviews feature, saying it is typically accurate and was tested extensively beforehand. But Liz Reid, the head of Google's search business, acknowledged in a blog post Friday that “some odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews certainly did show up.”\n\nWhile many of the examples were silly, others were dangerous or harmful falsehoods.\n\nThe Associated Press last week asked Google about which wild mushrooms to eat, and it responded with a lengthy AI-generated summary that was mostly technical correct, but “a lot of information is missing that could have the potential to be sickening or even fatal,” said Mary Catherine Aime, a professor of mycology and botany at Purdue University who reviewed Google's response to the AP's query.\n\nFor example, information about mushrooms known as puffballs was “more or less correct,” she said, but Google's overview emphasized looking for those with solid white flesh — which many potentially deadly puffball mimics also have.\n\nIn another widely shared example, an AI researcher asked Google how many Muslims have been president of the United States, and it responded confidently with a long-debunked conspiracy theory: “The United States has had one Muslim president, Barack Hussein Obama.”\n\nGoogle last week made an immediate fix to prevent a repeat of the Obama error because it violated the company's content policies.\n\nIn other cases, Reid said Friday that it has sought to make broader improvements such as “detection mechanisms for nonsensical queries” — such as “How many rocks should I eat?” — that shouldn’t be answered with an AI summary.\n\nThe AI systems were also updated to limit the use of user-generated content — such as social media posts on Reddit — that could offer misleading advice. In one widely shared example, Google's AI overview last week pulled from a satirical Reddit comment to suggest using glue to get cheese to stick to pizza.\n\nReid said the company has also added more “triggering restrictions” to improve the quality of answers to certain queries, such as about health.\n\nGoogle's summaries are designed to get people authoritative answers to the information they’re looking for as quickly as possible without having to click through a ranked list of website links.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut some AI experts have long warned Google against ceding its search results to AI-generated answers that could perpetuate bias and misinformation and endanger people looking for help in an emergency. AI systems known as large language models work by predicting what words would best answer the questions asked of them based on the data they’ve been trained on. They’re prone to making things up — a widely studied problem known as hallucination.\n\nIn her Friday blog post, Reid argued that Google's AI overviews “generally don’t ‘hallucinate’ or make things up in the ways that other” large language model-based products might because they are more closely integrated with Google's traditional search engine in only showing what's backed up by top web results.\n\n“When AI Overviews get it wrong, it’s usually for other reasons: misinterpreting queries, misinterpreting a nuance of language on the web, or not having a lot of great information available,” she wrote.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Etsy (ETSY) Up 3.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Etsy (ETSY). Shares have added about 3.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Etsy due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nETSY's Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y\n\nEtsy reported first-quarter 2024 earnings of 48 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.04%. The bottom-line figure reflects a year-over-year decrease of 9.4%.\r\n\r\nRevenues advanced 0.8% year over year to $645.95 million. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%.\r\n\r\nTop-line growth was driven by accelerating services revenues.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across active sellers and reactivated buyers remained positive.\n\nTop Line in Detail\n\nMarketplace revenues were $466.98 million (72.3% of the total revenues), down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Nevertheless, ETSY acquired 5.7 million new buyers, which was a major positive. The total number of active buyers on Etsy’s marketplace stood at 91.6 million, which increased 1.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nServices revenues were $178.97 million (27.7% of the total revenues), up 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. Etsy ads acted as a key driver of revenue growth.\n\nQuarterly Specifics\n\nEtsy’s active buyer base increased 0.9% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to 96.4 million, which missed the consensus mark of 96.6 million.\r\n\r\nThe active seller base stood at 9.13 million, up 15% year over year. The figure missed the consensus mark of 9.3 million. Increasing investments to support sellers with new tools and insights, such as a ‘Growth Page’ with customer insights to help sellers grow their businesses and a new ‘earnings calculator’ to assist sellers in understanding various inputs that go into their profitability, had a positive effect on seller base growth.\r\n\r\nETSY witnessed solid momentum in buyer reactivation. Reactivated buyers were 6.3 million, up 5.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nGross Merchandise Sales (GMS) of $3 billion were down 3.7% on a reported basis and 4.1% on a currency-neutral basis from the prior-year quarter. The reported figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Etsy marketplace’s GMS was $2.6 billion, down 5.3% on a reported basis from the year-ago quarter’s figure.\n\nOperating Details\n\nIn first-quarter 2024, the gross margin was 71%, which expanded 150 basis points year over year.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses were $390.73 million, up 6.4% from the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of revenues, the figure expanded to 60.5% from 57.3% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nConsequently, ETSY reported an operating income of $68.1 million compared with an operating income of $78.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flows\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $788.84 million, which decreased from $914.32 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nShort-term investments were $254.88 million, up from $236.12 million in the previous quarter.\r\n\r\nLong-term debt stood at $2.28 billion at the end of the first quarter, which remained flat compared with the figure at the end of the prior quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company generated $69.03 million in cash from operations, down from $295.1 million in the previous quarter.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor second-quarter 2024, Etsy anticipates the take rate to be similar to the actual Q1’24 figure of 21.6%.\r\n\r\nGMS is expected to decline, with the downside being a mid-single-digit decline and the upside being the top end of a low-single-digit decline\r\n\r\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be similar to the reported Q1’24 figure of 26%.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -8.5% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Etsy has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Etsy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nEtsy belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), has gained 3% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of D.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nZillow Q1 Earnings Meet Estimates, Top Line Surges Y/Y\n\nZillow Group  reported relatively healthy first-quarter 2024 results, with the top line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line matching the same. The company witnessed a revenue expansion year over year, backed by strong momentum in all verticals.\r\n\r\nIt has a solid brand position in the residential real estate industry. The company boasts more than 217 million average monthly unique users across the Zillow ecosystem of apps and sites. Zillow’s advanced technology, such as Real Time Touring, Listing Showcase, Follow Up Boss CRM and ShowingTime touring software, are gaining strong popularity among real estate agents. However, a challenging macroeconomic environment remains a headwind.\n\nNet Income\n\nGAAP net loss in the quarter was $23 million or a loss of 10 cents per share compared with a net loss of $22 million or a loss of 9 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The marginal increase in losses despite higher revenues was due to higher operating expenses.\r\n \r\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the company’s net income improved to $93 million or 36 cents per share from $87 million or 35 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nRevenues\n\nQuarterly revenues increased to $529 million from $469 million in the prior year quarter. Healthy growth in the residential and rental segment boosted the top line. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $509 million.\r\n\r\nResidential revenues witnessed a 9% increase from $361 million in the prior-year quarter to $393 million in first-quarter 2024, driven by healthy growth in Premier Agent Business. Growth in the New Construction business, expansion of Listing Showcase nationwide through ShowingTime+ and contributions from Follow Up Boss also supported net sales in this vertical.\r\n\r\nRevenues in the rental segment witnessed a 31% rise to $97 million from $74 million in the previous-year quarter. The expansion in rental revenues was driven by solid growth in multifamily listings.\r\n\r\nThe mortgages segment generated $31 million in revenues compared with $26 million in the year-earlier quarter, backed by solid growth in purchase loan origination.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nDuring the quarter, Zillow recorded a gross profit of $406 million compared with $377 million in the prior-year quarter, with respective margins of 77% and 80%. The operating expenses during the quarter were $451 million, up from $422 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $125 million compared with $104 million a year ago.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Zillow generated $80 million in cash from operating activities compared with $93 million a year ago. As of Mar 31, 2024, the company had $1.44 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $1 billion in convertible senior notes, net of current portion.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Zillow expects total revenues to be in the range of $525-$540 million. Residential revenues are expected in the band of $372-$382 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $100 million.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nAnalysts were quiet during the last two month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Zillow has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nZillow has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nZillow is part of the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Over the past month, Alphabet (GOOGL), a stock from the same industry, has gained 3.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2024 more than a month ago.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, indicating a change of +28.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of D.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Here's Why Alphabet (GOOGL) is a Must-Buy Stock Right Now",
        "content": "Investors looking for maximum returns should consider Alphabet GOOGL adding to their portfolios due to its solid fundamental strength.\r\n\r\nShares of the search giant have risen 23.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 18.1% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 11.5% during the same time frame.\r\n\r\nThis outperformance reflects the company’s back-to-back quarters of impressive financial performance. Alphabet’s earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.3%. In its last reported quarter, the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark and witnessed strong year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nWe believe that GOOGL shares have further room for expansion, given the company’s growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities. Its leading position in the search engine space, strengthening cloud footprint, solid momentum in YouTube and Android, and growing traction in the autonomous driving space should aid Alphabet’s prospects further.\r\n\r\nThe upswing in the company’s estimates testifies to the aforesaid fact. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues and earnings is pegged at $295.53 billion and $7.61 per share, respectively. This indicates year-over-year improvements of 15.2% in the top line and 31.2% in the bottom line. The EPS estimate has also moved 0.5% north over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nLet us delve deeper into the fundamental strength of Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Generative AI Capabilities: Key Catalyst\n\nGoogle is well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\r\n\r\nThe company is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Growing momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive.\r\n\r\nGoogle recently introduced various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe new tools include the likes of MaxDiffusion — a collection of reference implementations of various diffusion models, JetStream — a new engine to run generative AI models, MaxText — a collection of text-generating AI models targeting tensor processing units (TPUs), and NVIDIA’s GPUs in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThe company’s launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool called Gemini Code Assist is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI capabilities position Alphabet well to capitalize on the growth prospects in the booming generative AI market, which, per a report from Fortune Business Insights, is expected to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 47.5% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nSearch Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nThe strong efforts of Google toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search business are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in Search Generative Experience, which leverages the generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, should benefit Google’s search business in the near term.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s initiative to improve search results by combining LLMs’ capabilities with multi-search and visual exploration features is another positive. The growing momentum of Bard bodes well for search revenues.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus. These factors will continue to boost the search traffic on the Chrome browser.\n\nCloud Strength Drives Growth\n\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key growth driver of Alphabet, owing to strengthening cloud service offerings. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace has been driving growth in the Google Cloud segment.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are major positives. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and growing number of data centers are helping Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. The increasing number of cloud regions and availability zones globally is a major positive.\r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of generative AI-powered Workspace tools is a plus. Strength in Google’s Kubernetes offerings is contributing well to driving customer momentum.\r\n\r\nGOOGL’s efforts in integrating data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform are bolstering its prospects in the data cloud market.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nWe believe that Alphabet presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong market position in generative AI, search engine and cloud. Strong financial health, combined with its commitment to innovation and strategic growth, positions it well for sustained success.\r\n\r\nAlphabet currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Tyler Technologies TYL and Nutanix NTNX, each flaunting Zacks Rank #1 at present.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA has surged 131.9% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $116.4 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 91%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $25.10 per share, which implies a 93.7% increase from that reported in fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nTyler Technologies has gained 14.2% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TYL’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pinned at $2.12 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 8.8%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $9.19 per share, which implies a 17.8% increase from the fiscal 2023 actual.\r\n\r\nNutanix has gained 18.1% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NTNX’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $2.14 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14.7%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.08 per share, which implies an 80% increase from the fiscal 2023 reported number.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives.\n\nDespite these challenges, OpenAI’s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT.\n\nAltman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure.\n\nOpenAI’s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark.

        "content": "Google's AI tool incorrectly claimed that former US president Barack Obama was the country's first Muslim leader - AP Photo/Alastair Grant\n\nGoogle has limited what search results are answered by its artificial intelligence (AI) systems after they resulted in a string of errors including claiming Barack Obama was a Muslim.\n\nThe company said it was adding new restrictions to its “AI overview” feature, which provided AI summaries of answers to search queries.\n\nThis includes limiting the number of health-related queries that will be answered by AI, restricting the types of website used by the system, and introducing restrictions where the AI answers were deemed unhelpful.\n\nGoogle unveiled the AI overview feature earlier this month and introduced it widely in the US last week before a planned worldwide launch later this year. The feature reads and interprets information from other websites to provide short summaries to people’s questions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, last week users found that it would provide incorrect answers to questions, often using joke websites or posts on internet forums, or by misinterpreting reliable sources.\n\nThis included recommending that people eat “one small rock a day”, based on an article in the satirical news website The Onion, or using glue to make pizza, referencing a comment on Reddit. It said Mr Obama was the first Muslim US president after misunderstanding an academic textbook.\n\nHowever, Google said that several screenshots widely shared on social media last week, such as encouraging pregnant women to smoke or saying it was acceptable to leave dogs in hot cars, were fake.\n\nGoogle said it had created “additional triggering refinements” for health queries, meaning AI overviews are less likely to show up for medical questions. It said it had built better mechanisms for joke websites, and restricted queries “where AI overviews were not proving to be as helpful”.\n\nHowever, it is persisting with the feature, and insisted that users were finding it useful. Google's Gemini chatbot was also curbed after it began generating historically inaccurate images of black Nazis\n\nGoogle has suffered a series of embarrassments related to its AI services in recent months. It stopped its Gemini chatbot from generating images of people after users found it would draw historically inaccurate images of black Nazi soldiers.\n\nIts previous chatbot, Gemini, was found to offer political opinions such as claiming Brexit was a bad idea.",

        "content": "In its latest report, Barclays (LON:BARC) provides a detailed analysis of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s performance in India, highlighting both challenges and growth opportunities. Despite facing a slowdown in certain segments, Amazon India remains a significant player in the country’s burgeoning e-commerce market.\n\nAccording to Barclays, India's overall e-commerce gross merchandise value (GMV) is growing at around 20%, with government estimates pegging it at approximately $120 billion. Amazon holds just under 30% of this market. However, tax filings for the fiscal year ending March 2023 indicate that Amazon India’s B2C revenue grew by a modest 3% year-over-year (y/y), a notable deceleration compared to the pandemic-boosted years.\n\nOffer: Click here and don't miss out on this exclusive offer to access premium features of InvestingPro, including the powerful screeners, fair value calculator, financial health check, etc. and embark on your journey towards financial success. And the best part? It is currently available at a 69% discount, priced at just INR 216/month.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) continues to be a strong performer in India, generating $1.6 billion in revenue with a 43% y/y growth, even after a high 66% y/y growth in the previous fiscal year. Conversely, Amazon Pay’s revenue grew by only 5% y/y to $260 million, down from 17% in the prior year, indicating a loss of market share to other payment options.\n\nBarclays estimates that Amazon India’s GMV for FY23, excluding B2B transactions, stands at around $18 billion, with an overall GMV of approximately $21 billion when including all business segments. This represents a 3-4% decline in USD terms, attributed to the continued reduction of the wholesale business following regulatory changes in 2019.\n\nAmazon India accounts for 4.8% of Amazon's international retail revenue but also 11% of its international operating income losses. For calendar Q1 2023, India generated $5.6 billion in revenue (up 1% y/y) and incurred $0.9 billion in pre-tax losses. Notably, Amazon has significantly reduced its total international operating income losses, with a substantial decrease from -$7.7 billion to -$0.5 billion year-over-year, thanks to cost-saving measures in mature international markets outside India. Barclays expects the operating income in India to stabilize without much fluctuation in the future.\n\nGovernment data suggests steady e-commerce growth in India at around 20% for 2024, consistent with last year, potentially reaching just over $120 billion in GMV. Other estimates, such as the Google-Tamasek-Bain study, suggest a lower figure, but Barclays relies on IBEF data for its global e-commerce industry model.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndia's per-capita e-commerce spending is still significantly lower than in Western markets due to lower income levels, but the trend is improving. A recent Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) study projects India’s B2C e-commerce GMV to grow at a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), driven by a growing online shopper base and increasing per-capita consumption. Improvements in digital infrastructure and increasing digital-first habits among Tier 2+ populations are also contributing to this growth. However, challenges remain due to low population density and diverse consumer profiles in these areas.\n\nA Nielsen study commissioned by Amazon India reveals that Amazon.in is the preferred shopping destination for 68% of consumers during the annual festive season. Over 78% of consumers trust online shopping, with Amazon.in identified as the most trusted and convenient online brand.\n\nIn summary, despite regulatory challenges and market slowdowns, Amazon India demonstrates resilience with significant market share and steady revenue streams in AWS. The company's strategic focus on digital infrastructure and consumer trust continues to position it well in the evolving Indian e-commerce landscape.\n\nUnlock the true value of stocks with InvestingPro by clicking here – your ultimate stock analysis tool!

        "title": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders have earned a 26% CAGR over the last five years",
        "content": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) share price has soared 222% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 25% over the last quarter.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, Alphabet managed to grow its earnings per share at 27% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 26%. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Alphabet shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 38% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 26% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Is Alphabet cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Are you looking for some new high-growth stocks to add to your portfolio? You could start with the most obvious option at the moment: artificial intelligence (AI) players.\n\nDescribing AI as a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity doesn't seem like hyperbole anymore. Even without knowing exactly what the AI industry will look like just five years from now, it's quite clear at this point that it's going to live up to the hype. The chief challenge now is simply figuring out which companies are best positioned to benefit.\n\nThat brings me to three artificial intelligence stocks that aren't yet fully valued in light of their potential. Arguably, each of these three tickers could explode higher once more investors connect the dots.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nYou've most likely heard of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and you may have noticed that software giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has melded its Bing search engine with an AI-powered conversational assistant called Copilot. You may have even tinkered with this tool, or with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) comparable chatbot, Gemini (formerly called Bard). There's no denying these tools are fun to play with, in addition to being legitimately helpful to many who use them.\n\nFrom a monetization perspective though, these platforms don't appear to have a great deal of commercial appeal. ChatGPT and Copilot, however, don't represent the best use cases for artificial intelligence technology. AI platforms purpose-built for business are proving far more marketable.\n\nEnter Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nAs a consumer, you will not have used its service. Companies like General Mills, the CBS television network, and Aramark are some of its newest clients, though, joining a growing number of enterprises using Palantir's offerings to help them do something constructive with the mountains of digitized data they've been gathering for years. The company's software is also being used by the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, energy company ExxonMobil, and drugmaker Sanofi, just to name a few. There has simply not been a data-analysis option powerful enough to pay for ... until now.\n\nPalantir Technologies has only scratched the surface of its potential, though. Analysts expect its top line to grow to the tune of 21% this year and then repeat the feat next year. CEO Alex Karp's only complaint is that the company can't keep up with demand.\n\nShares are performing well, by the way. They're up more than 50% for the past year, and higher by more than 130% for the past couple of years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's reason to expect Palantir stock could catapult higher, however, given the company's profitability as well as the fact that it's already a market leader in its niche. Technology market research outfits Gartner and Forrester Research both consistently rank it as one of the top names of the AI data-analysis space, comparing it to much bigger players like Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nMost everyone understands Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) hardware sits at the heart of most artificial intelligence data centers. Analysts with Mizuho Securities suggest it controls about 90% of the AI-processor market.\n\nThose graphics processing units (GPUs) and similar powerful processors are only one piece of the technological puzzle which is an AI data center. Artificial intelligence servers are actually massive banks of individual computers that must be built around a processor and then tethered together on a giant rack (or racks). Some company has to manufacture these computers and then assemble the towers they become a part of.\n\nThat's what Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) does. Whether a customer prefers Nvidia's tech or Intel's, and whether that client wants to use Amazon's cloud computing service or Microsoft's, Super Micro Computer can deliver.\n\nAnd it's been delivering like crazy. Last quarter's top line was up an incredible 200% year over year, extending a well-established growth trend that's expected to last well into the future. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 60% in its next fiscal year. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThat's just the beginning. Precedence Research forecasts that the AI infrastructure market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 27% through 2033 as more and more organizations rush to build the AI platforms they're increasingly realizing they'll need if they want to remain competitive.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's stock price has drifted sideways after peeling back from March's peak. It's most likely just taking a breather though, ahead of its next leg higher.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nLast but not least, add Alphabet to your list of AI stocks that could go parabolic in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's a well-respected tech name, but some might find it tough to see the Google parent as an AI play. Although its Gemini/Bard chatbot is a clever use of AI tech, there aren't a great deal of practical commercial applications for it. Besides, the company's core business is advertising. Adding an AI profit center to the mix could be quite an undertaking.\n\nAlphabet is taking the task on, however, and is better positioned to make it worth the effort than you might think.\n\nSee, Alphabet isn't aimlessly building an AI business from scratch just for the sake of seeing what happens. It's using artificial intelligence as a means of making its existing advertising business even better. Just last week, the company announced it will soon allow advertisers to use AI-generated ads, for instance. The company also says ads will soon begin appearing within its new AI Overviews, which are a separate category of search results for anyone using the Google search engine. Of course, more meaningful data about Google's users helps advertisers as well as Alphabet.\n\nWhat could really sustain and even accelerate the stock's current advance, however, is renewed optimism from the analyst community. Bank of America analyst Justin Post recently reiterated his buy rating on Alphabet stock, citing the latest advancements in its AI advertising tech. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan said the same.\n\nBoth recognize that advertising is and will remain Alphabet's big breadwinner into the distant future. Its foray into artificial intelligence is complementary to this business, though, without conflicting with it. Investors may be underestimating the degree of revenue growth that's in store here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "A person performs a Google search on their mobile phone. Arkan Perdana / Unsplash\n\nEarly in 2020, Airbnb diverted about $800 million in spend on performance marketing — mostly Google keyword advertising — and tilted more toward marketing its brand in avenues like video, social media and public relations.\n\nAirbnb had been criticized pre-pandemic for spending too much of its marketing on Google. In addition to leaning away from Google starting in 2019 and 2020, Airbnb tested participating in Google Vacation Rentals, the price comparison service, but ultimately decided not to get involved.\n\nBut at the Bernstein conference Thursday, Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Ellie Mertz said during an interview on stage that the company over the last year has spent “modestly more” on marketing through Google. Airbnb has used Google advertising products including “keywords” and Audiences, she added.\n\nAirbnb Is Spending on Google Where It Makes Sense\n\nMertz said Airbnb “dials up and down” marketing on Google where Airbnb sees the opportunity for efficient marketing spend.\n\nBased on several Airbnb initiatives over the last year, the company has been able to spend “modestly more” on Google “and maintain greater efficiencies,” she said.\n\nMertz emphasized that “performance marketing continues to be a minority of our overall marketing spend… This is not a big portion of our marketing budget or a percent of revenue,” she added.\n\nAsked why Airbnb wouldn’t spend 10 times more on performance marketing to drive 5% of incremental revenue growth, Mertz said: “First and foremost, we don’t depend on them very substantially. So as I said earlier, 90% of our traffic is coming from direct sources, which is a great thing in the overall context of the P&L.”\n\nAirbnb is an outlier among online travel companies. Booking Holdings and Expedia Group spend billions of dollars on Google performance marketing, and that is a much higher percentage of their revenue annually than Airbnb’s spend on the search engine.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to overhaul its Siri virtual assistant with more advanced artificial intelligence, a move that will let users control individual app functions with their voice, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Becomes First Former US President Guilty of Crimes World’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar South Africa Election Results With 29% Voting Districts In Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump\n\nThe new system will allow Siri to take command of all the features within apps for the first time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative isn’t public. That change required a revamp of Siri’s underlying software using large language models — a core technology behind generative AI — and will be one of the highlights of Apple’s renewed push into AI, they said.\n\nThe upgrade is one piece of the company’s larger AI strategy, which will be unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. Apple is preparing several features, including voice memo transcriptions and summaries, quick recaps of websites and notifications, automated message replies, advanced photo editing, and AI-generated emojis, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nAs part of the rollout, more basic AI tasks will be processed on devices themselves, while more advanced capabilities will be handled via cloud computing. The company also has been forging a deal with OpenAI to integrate the startup’s chatbot and other technology into the iOS operating system, and it remains in talks with Google parent Alphabet Inc. to use its Gemini software in the future. Apple software boss Craig Federighi has told his teams to develop as many new AI features as possible for this year’s operating system updates.\n\nSiri will be a key focus of the WWDC unveiling. The new system will allow the assistant to control and navigate an iPhone or iPad with more precision. That includes being able to open individual documents, moving a note to another folder, sending or deleting an email, opening a particular publication in Apple News, emailing a web link, or even asking the device for a summary of an article.\n\nA representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nToday, Siri is limited mostly to broader commands like playing music playlists, looking up information or controlling smart home appliances. The company also offers what are known as app intents to developers, allowing them to craft ways for Siri to tap individual features. In 2018, Apple launched Siri Shortcuts as well, letting users manually create commands for app features.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new system will go further, using AI to analyze what people are doing on their devices and automatically enable Siri-controlled features. It will be limited to Apple’s own apps at the beginning, with the company planning to support hundreds of different commands.\n\nRead More: Apple Needs to Evolve to Compete in the Artificial Intelligence Era\n\nThe feature is one of Apple’s more complex AI initiatives and isn’t planned for release until as soon as next year, when it will be part of a subsequent update to iOS 18, according to the people. The first version of the new operating system will launch in September, around the same time as the next iPhone models.\n\nAt the start, the new Siri will handle one command at a time, but Apple has plans to to allow users to chain commands together. For example, they could ask Siri to summarize a recorded meeting and then text it to a colleague in one request. Or an iPhone could theoretically be asked to crop a picture and then email it to a friend.\n\nA major component of the new push is a system that will use AI to automatically determine if a function should be handled on the device or via the cloud.\n\nThat has raised some privacy questions. While on-device tasks won’t share personal information, the cloud-based approach will require some user data to be transferred to remote servers. The information will be protected by the so-called Secure Enclave in the high-end Apple Mac chips powering the data centers, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.\n\nRead More: Apple to Power AI Tools With In-House Server Chips This Year\n\nApple will attempt to further reassure customers that their data is private by creating an “intelligence report” that explains how the information is secured. The iPhone maker also won’t build profiles of customers — something it’s criticized Google and Meta Platforms Inc. for doing.\n\nWith the Siri upgrade, Apple is looking to reinvigorate a pioneering product that fell behind competitors’ services. The company first launched Siri in 2011, giving it a head start in voice-based interfaces and AI. But Apple soon lost that lead to Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and the Google Assistant. Then it was caught flat-footed again when generative AI chatbots emerged two years ago.\n\nApple also is contending with a sales slowdown, and its shares have underperformed those of peers this year. The stock is down about 1% in 2024, compared with a 10% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index. Apple was up 0.5% to $191.29 in New York on Thursday.\n\nApple is betting that the new AI features for the iPhone, iPad and Mac — as well as the Siri enhancements — will encourage users to upgrade their devices. Many of the on-device AI capabilities will require an iPhone 15 Pro or later to work. Macs and iPads, meanwhile, will need at least an M1 chip.\n\n(Updates with shares in second-to-last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo’s Race to Boost Supplies Israel’s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another ‘Lost Decade’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav is leaning on the company's other sports assets as it remains at risk of losing a key media rights deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\n\"We continue to talk to the NBA,\" Zaslav said while speaking at a Bernstein conference on Thursday. \"We love our experience with the NBA. But in general, we're a leader in sports... [with] a full buffet of content around the world.\"\n\nThe executive touted the company's Olympics coverage win in Europe, along with the recent additions of NHL games, Nascar races and college football in the US.\n\n\"This is what we do for a living,\" he said. \"We're in the business of sport, and in sport, the deals come up [and] you make a decision about the overall quality of the full menu of content you have for each of your platforms.\" DALLAS, TEXAS - MAY 28: Luka Doncic #77 of the Dallas Mavericks handles the ball against the Minnesota Timberwolves during the first quarter in Game Four of the Western Conference Finals at American Airlines Center on May 28, 2024 in Dallas, Texas.

(Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images) (Matthew Stockman via Getty Images)\n\nThe NBA's current contract with Warner Bros.' TNT Network and Disney's ESPN (DIS) expires at the end of next season, and rumors have swirled in recent weeks that WBD could lose the media rights to its portion of games to Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). Amazon (AMZN) is also in talks for an exclusive streaming deal through its Prime Video service.\n\nWall Street analysts have said that possibility would have lasting consequences for the embattled media giant.\n\n\"Losing NBA rights would be a big negative for WBD,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen said in a note published earlier this month. \"While the cost savings may help earnings, we think sports content is key both for linear TV ad sales and carriage fees, and for the Max streaming service's prospects in a competitive direct-to-consumer landscape, especially as it prepares to join the sports streaming [joint venture] with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for legacy media players as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable package or streaming service fee to access sports over many other types of content.\n\nBut the field has become more competitive, with tech giants like Amazon, Apple (AAPL), and YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) committing more heavily to sports streaming deals over the past year. That's inflated the overall costs of sports as traditional media giants struggle to keep up.\n\nWarner Bros. currently shells out a reported $1.2 billion annually for the NBA rights. Disney, the NBA's other major broadcast partner, has agreed to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion in order to renew its deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStory continues\n\nA separate report from the Sports Business Journal suggests Disney's total pay package is closer to $2.8 billion. Amazon's deal is said to be worth between $1.8 billion and $2 billion.\n\nNotably, WBD has the ability to match third-party offers before the NBA enters into any agreements.\n\nLast week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver briefly addressed the negotiations, telling TMZ: \"We’re all still talking.

        "title": "Why China’s robo-taxi hopefuls face a rough ride in the U.S.",
        "content": "Yesterday we published a piece I wrote for Fortune magazine’s next issue, on how Alphabet’s Waymo is—for now, at least—the front runner in self-driving cars. You can read it here, but the gist is that Waymo was able to take a more cautious approach than rivals such as Cruise and Uber, and this seems to be paying off in the form of a steadily-expanding business and a relative lack of regulatory woes.\n\nOne thing that I all-too-briefly touched on in the article was the subject of Waymo’s Chinese competitors, which have begun testing their vehicles on American roads—companies like Pony.ai, AutoX, and Apollo (owned by Baidu, China’s answer to Google) that have long been allowed to ply robo-taxi services on limited routes in cities like Shenzhen and Beijing. AutoX and Apollo even have California DMV permission for fully-autonomous “Level 4” tests without a driver present.\n\nSo if Waymo’s U.S. rivals are currently stalled or way behind, could the real threat be Chinese? The experts I interviewed for my article certainly aren’t writing off that possibility—though Frederic Bruneteau, of the Ptolemus automotive consultancy, did warn that these companies may have a harder time dealing with the fallout of any crashes in the U.S. than they’ve done in China, where there’s no free press and the authorities may be more tolerant of potential national champions.\n\nBut I reckon the Chinese robo-taxi players’ biggest problem in the U.S. will be anti-Chinese sentiment, grounded in national-security concerns. We already saw President Biden order an investigation into Chinese internet-connected cars in February, homing in on the risks of their data collection. That probe is legally underpinned by executive orders from both Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump. But these orders can be overturned by a future president, so yesterday Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mi.) introduced a bill that would ensure such an investigation can’t be simply dropped.\n\n“We’ve worked with the Commerce Department on this bill to establish a formal national security review of Chinese-made connected vehicles,” Slotkin said. “The legislation would also codify the Department of Commerce’s authority to ban any connected vehicles from the U.S. market if the review makes clear they pose a risk to national security.”\n\nThis has implications for the wider U.S. auto market—all new cars are connected these days, and national security is one way to counter an invasion of China’s cheap, popular electric vehicles in particular. But it would really be a big deal for robo-taxi development, and I’m not just talking about companies like AutoX and Apollo. Waymo itself is working with China’s Zeekr (which is owned by Volvo parent Geely, and which listed in New York this month) on a new, steering-wheel-free self-driving car that may supersede the modified Jaguars Waymo currently has on the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo stay tuned to see how Slotkin’s bill fares. Meanwhile, there’s another aspect of the Waymo story that I didn’t have space for in my article: the potential for licensing out its Waymo Driver system to traditional automakers.\n\nThe likes of Mercedes-Benz and Volvo are selling or preparing to sell cars that can achieve “Level 3” autonomy, meaning the car can monitor and react to its environment on its own—unlike a “Level 2” Tesla, in which the driver is supposed to keep an eye out at all times. But a human driver still needs to be around to take control occasionally. Ford and Volkswagen are also targeting Level 3, despite setbacks over the years. But there are plenty of other car manufacturers that lack the resources to develop self-driving cars on their own.\n\nAccording to Bruneteau, this—and the fact that Waymo doesn’t present competition in the automaking field—may provide an opportunity for Alphabet’s operation to license its technology. “There could be an invasion from the robo-taxi segment to the high-end and midrange segments of those [automakers] who haven’t been able to sufficiently invest,” he told me. “And today, that’s most of them.”\n\nAnd a Waymo spokesperson indicated that this is indeed an option, noting that the Waymo Driver could be integrated with everything from ride-hailing vehicles and trucks to personal cars: “By building a driver, not a vehicle, we’re building a system of multiple applications and routes to commercial scale, which means we have multiple routes to huge markets without being locked into a single use case, and that our share of the [autonomous vehicle] market can grow without the costs of vehicle manufacturing.”\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Following our valuation discipline, we continued to methodically rotate from more fully priced stocks to those trading at healthier discounts to our value estimates. We trimmed more tech-adjacent winners during the quarter, including Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been the most notable trim over the past two quarters. In effect, we removed the heavy overweight layer of the position size, which had been in the 6% to 8% range for most of the last five years. Part of the decision simply reflected valuation prudence after an exceptional period where the stock price ran well ahead of our estimate of business value growth.

        "title": "Exclusive: Google, augmented reality startup Magic Leap strike partnership deal",
        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google and augmented reality startup Magic Leap are forming a strategic technology partnership and working on building immersive experiences that blend the physical and digital worlds.\n\nMagic Leap said in a blog post on Thursday that the two companies have agreed to a partnership. A Google spokesperson confirmed the agreement.\n\nWhile short on details, the announcement adds to signals that Google may be plotting a return to the market for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies that it so far has largely yielded to rivals Meta and Apple.\n\nThe partnership would combine Florida-based Magic Leap's expertise in optics and device manufacturing with Google's technology platforms, Magic Leap said.\n\n\"We've shipped a couple of different versions of augmented reality devices so far, so we're out there delivering things, and Google has a long history of platforms thinking,\" Magic Leap's Chief Technology Officer Julie Larson-Green told Reuters in an interview ahead of the announcement.\n\n\"So we're thinking, putting our expertise and their expertise together, there's lots of things we could end up doing,\" she said.\n\nGoogle is an investor in Magic Leap, which is majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The startup was an early darling in the AR headset space, but struggled to find a consumer niche and more recently started exploring arrangements to license its technology or produce components for others.\n\nMagic Leap and Google both declined to say whether the partnership was expected to yield a consumer AR device. Google also has been collaborating with Samsung Electronics since early last year to develop mixed reality technologies, which the Google spokesman said was unchanged by the deal with Magic Leap.\n\nLarson-Green said she was especially eager to work with some of the \"cool AI tie-ins\" with augmented reality that Google announced at its annual developer conference earlier this month.\n\nIn a video at that event, Google showed off an AI agent called Project Astra by having someone don a glasses prototype and ask the agent questions about what that person was seeing. The agent gave answers in both audio form and as digital text overlaid on the lenses.\n\nThat functionality is similar to what Meta is planning for its Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which added an AI assistant last year and in April received a software update enabling the agent to identify objects seen by the wearer in audio form.\n\nFIRST MOVER\n\nIf Google were to jump back into making AR glasses, it would be yet another dramatic twist in the company's on-again, off-again relationship with the technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle was a first mover in what it pitched as an AR revolution more than a decade ago, when it introduced its Google Glass smart glasses. Its enthusiasm then was so great that it unveiled the device in an elaborate 2012 demo involving skydivers using the glasses to live stream a jump on to a San Francisco building.\n\nHowever, consumers recoiled at the product's clunky design and privacy concerns, to the point that those who wore it were sometimes called \"glassholes.\" Google retreated from the consumer market in 2015 and later abandoned the enterprise market as well.\n\nTwo years ago, though, the company came back with a preview of a new set of glasses that it said would display real-time translations of conversations in English, Mandarin, Spanish and American Sign Language.\n\nThe future of that project was thrown into doubt in January, when Google laid off hundreds of employees in its hardware units, including the majority of its AR team.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Kenneth Li and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite index has climbed over 30% in the last 12 months, primarily driven by tech stocks. The industry has surged as interest in budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing has skyrocketed. As a result, it could be worth making a hefty investment in the industry to potentially profit from its long-term development.\n\nRegarding the stock market, it's always best to invest in a company's business rather than merely its stock. Prioritizing organizations that are home to consumer-favorite products or at least have a solid business model can keep your portfolio expanding for decades. Meanwhile, tech companies are known for their long-term gains, with many benefiting from the industry's ever-expanding and innovative nature.\n\nSo, are you planning to sink $50,000 into stocks? Here are two of the best stocks that money can buy (and are even worth buying with a smaller investment).\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has turned many heads over the last year as it has made significant changes to its business model after a challenging few years. The company's stock has lost 40% since 2021, brought down by poor market conditions, tumbling revenue, and shrinking market share in the central processing unit (CPU) sector.\n\nHowever, Intel's recent headwinds are why now could be the best time to buy. AMD PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Intel is one of AI's best-valued stocks, with a lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio than some of the industry's most prominent players. Each of these companies either currently has or has announced a venture into the AI chip market, making them fierce competitors to Intel. Yet, a recent dip has potentially made Intel's shares a bargain compared to its peers, allowing your money to go further.\n\nLast month, the company debuted its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, a chip designed to outperform market leader Nvidia's AI graphics processing units (GPUs). Meanwhile, Intel is undergoing a major shift in its business model, transitioning into a foundry model, which will see it prioritize chip manufacturing.\n\nOn May 16, CEO Pat Gelsinger spoke about its coming plant in Ohio, saying, \"I want our Columbus site here, Ohio One, to be the AI systems fab for the nation.\"\n\nIntel is on a promising growth trajectory as it expands in AI and sets its sights on manufacturing. It's still early days for the company's restructuring, but recent earnings are promising. In the first quarter of 2024, Intel's AI and data center segment posted an operating income of $184 million, a considerable rise from the negative $69 million it reported the year before. Additionally, Intel Foundry operating income rose 8% during the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel has a lot of work ahead, but on its current growth path, it could see its stock skyrocket over the next decade. An investment of $25,000 would grant you roughly 817 shares in Intel, significantly more than it would in competitors Nvidia or AMD, making Intel's stock a screaming buy right now.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like YouTube, Android, and Google, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has achieved a powerful position in tech. The company attracts billions of users to its services, which has seen its annual revenue and operating income soar 90% and 135% over the last five years.\n\nAlphabet has utilized its vast user base to build a lucrative advertising business. In the first quarter of 2024, the company enjoyed a spike in ad revenue, with Google Services sales rising 14% year over year while operating income soared 28%.\n\nHowever, all eyes have been on Alphabet's quickly expanding cloud business, Google Cloud. In its most recent quarter, the platform reported a 28% increase in revenue as operating income skyrocketed 371%. For reference, cloud giants Amazon and Microsoft saw their cloud revenue rise 17% and 21% in the same period. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nLike Intel, Alphabet is the best-valued option among its rivals. All of the companies in this chart have pivoted large parts of their businesses to developing AI software and are in steep competition with each other. Meanwhile, Alphabet's lower forward P/E indicates its stock is trading at a far better value than its competitors.\n\nA $25,000 investment would buy roughly 142 shares in Alphabet at its current price. The company's stock has climbed more than 200% over the last five years alone but could outperform that figure in the not-too-distant future as it continues to expand in AI and profit from its booming ad business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Sellers, Struggling to Boost Business, Are Buying Google Ads",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Great Oral Health has been selling dental products on Amazon.com Inc. for almost a decade, buying ads from the e-commerce giant to help it stand out on the sprawling marketplace. But lately, the company noticed that spending more on Amazon ads was doing little to drum up new business.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid American Air Fired Commercial Head After Sales Strategy Alienated Corporate Clients\n\nSo it turned to another well-known advertising company: Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nShoppers find Great Oral Health’s ads on Google when researching solutions for bad breath, gum disease and other maladies. The results direct them to the company’s oral probiotic on Amazon, which actually pays merchants to lure customers from other sites because it would rather keep the business than lose it to Walmart.com or another competitor.\n\nAmazon merchants have long used Google to drive shoppers to their own websites, with mixed results. Now new third-party software is helping them direct Google searchers to Amazon where they’re comfortable shopping. Sellers say the technique is boosting sales and improving their profits because Google ads are typically cheaper than Amazon’s. The credit Amazon pays for external traffic – typically 10% of the product price — sweetens the deal.\n\n“Amazon knows Google is a monster and all shoppers are walking in those corridors,” said Ryan Duminy, a consultant with Bullseye Sellers who manages advertising for Great Oral Health.\n\nAmazon has been selling ads for more than a decade, despite initial fears that doing so could muck up the shopping experience. Today, the Seattle-based company is a major industry player, generating $47 billion in advertising revenue last year. But it has become increasingly difficult to stand out on Amazon’s cluttered web store, prompting sellers and brands to search for marketing alternatives.\n\nGoogle, which has long struggled to become a shopping destination, is only too happy to help. In an effort to attract inflation-stung consumers, the search giant rolled out a deal-finding tool in the fall. Earlier this month, Google said it is beta-testing new features that let brands upload short videos to appear in their Google search results.\n\nBut what really changed the game for Amazon sellers is the emergence of startups like Toronto-based Carbon6 and Seattle-based Ampd, which developed algorithms adept at mining Google queries for shoppers itching to buy. Searchers can be targeted by age, marital status and income, metrics that can be used to calculate the likelihood of them making a purchase. The software also filters out information seekers, who may not be ready to pull the trigger.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The really big breakthrough is targeting likely buyers on Google and sending them to Amazon,” said Tim Jordan, chief community officer at Carbon6, whose PixelMe software helps companies hone their Google marketing campaigns. “If you send a lot of traffic from Google to Amazon and those people aren’t buying, that’s bad traffic. You don’t make any money.”\n\nMore than 70% of all purchases made on Amazon by shoppers directed there from Google advertisements are making their first purchase from that brand, making it a valuable pipeline for new customers, according to a report from Jungle Scout. More than one-third of Amazon sellers said increasing traffic to their products on Amazon from external sites such as Google is a priority this year, the report said.\n\nAmazon, in an emailed statement, said it helps sellers reach consumers through a variety of advertising initiatives, which all continue to grow. “One of these choices is the Brand Referral Bonus program, which helps brands improve the efficiency of their non-Amazon marketing campaigns.” Ampd, which says on its website that its software has directed 12 million Google users to Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nThe software tools tend to make the most financial sense for mid- to high-priced items, since keyword costs aren’t tied closely to a product’s price. If a merchant selling a $50 item on Amazon buys the Google search term for $5 or less, it’s essentially a free ad buy since Amazon credits them $5 for the traffic referral.\n\nOnline sellers are also responding to a decisive shift in consumer behavior. As recently as 2022, almost 52% of US shopping journeys began on online marketplaces such as Amazon.com, according to an annual survey by EMarketer. Last year, only 40% of shopping trips started there. Almost 30% of shoppers began their shopping on search engines like Google, up from 25% in the previous year.\n\nEMarketer analyst Sky Canaves says deal-hunting shoppers are site-hopping rather than limiting themselves to one marketplace. The proliferation of advertising on Amazon also makes it harder for them to find what they want, she said. “Consumers are looking to save and stretch their dollars wherever possible,” Canaves said. “They may find it easier to compare prices and find deals across retailers via search versus on marketplaces.”\n\nWith more shoppers using search engines to find products, it makes sense for Amazon sellers to advertise there.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo's Race to Boost Supplies New York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google promises $2 billion investment in Malaysia as Big Tech splurges on Southeast Asia spending",
        "content": "Big tech continues to spend big on Southeast Asia, with Malaysia landing a multi-billion dollar investment from Google just weeks after Microsoft pledged to spend $2.2 billion towards the country's tech sector.\n\nOn Thursday, Google committed to investing $2 billion in Malaysia, including developing a data center and cloud facility. The investment, Google's largest so far in Malaysia, is expected to support 26,500 jobs and add up to $3.2 billion to the economy, according to Bernama, the country's state news agency.\n\nGoogle's investment follows a similar pledge from its competitor Microsoft made earlier this month. While on a trip to Kuala Lumpur, the country's capital, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella promised to spend $2.2 billion in the Southeast Asian country, including offering AI skills training to 200,000 Malaysians and establishing a national AI \"Center of Excellence.\"\n\nSince 2022, the Malaysian government has offered tax incentives for technology-related investments, including data centers. The country also features cheaper land, power and water compared to neighboring Singapore. Companies increasingly considered Malaysia as an option for data center investments after Singapore, the region's data hub, imposed a three-year pause on new developments between 2019 and 2022, citing concerns over energy and land requirements for digital infrastructure.\n\nMalaysia is also trying to move up the semiconductor value chain, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim this week touting the country's \"neutral and non-aligned\" position between the U.S. and China.\n\nA wave of Southeast Asian tech investments\n\nU.S. tech giants are ramping up their investments in Southeast Asia, hoping to tap into the region's young workforce, rising incomes, and more neutral geopolitical position.\n\nIn addition to its $2.2 billion investment in Malaysia, Microsoft will also invest $1.7 billion in Indonesia over the next four years, targeting new cloud and AI infrastructure. The company also pledged to make \"significant commitments\" towards Thailand's cloud and AI industries.\n\nAmazon is pumping about $9 billion into Singapore over the next five years to grow the city-state's cloud infrastrucutre sector.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook also visited the region earlier this year. The company promised to increase its spending on Vietnam-based suppliers, and pledged $250 million to expand its Singpaore operations. Analysts suggested Cook's visit was an effort to \"hedge [Apple's] supply chain bets\" and create a runway for possible future investments in the fast-growing region.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore broadly, tech firms and manufacturers are shifting their supply chains to the region amid a fractious U.S.-China relationship. Chipmakers like Intel, Infineon, GlobalFoundries and Samsung have recently committed investment to Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be the 5 Largest Trillion-Dollar Stocks by 2035 (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "If there's one constant on Wall Street every investor should be aware of, it's change. History shows that, over time, Wall Street's biggest companies by market cap are constantly being reshuffled.\n\nIn 2000, brand-name businesses like Nokia, Intel, and General Electric were among the top 10 publicly traded companies by market cap. Today, just one of these top-10 companies from 2000 is still among the largest in the world (I'll get to this company a bit later).\n\nNo one has a crystal ball that can, with 100% accuracy, predict the future on Wall Street. But that doesn't stop investors from making educated guesses about the future, which is what I'm about to do now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThough technological innovations, mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs, and economic events can be extremely difficult to predict when looking years into the future, I believe the following five stocks will be the largest trillion-dollar companies by 2035 -- and artificial intelligence (AI) titan Nvidia, which may be in a mammoth bubble, won't be one of them!\n\n1. Amazon\n\nBy 2035, my expectation is that e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will comfortably be the largest publicly traded company in the U.S.\n\nThe fuel that should help Amazon capture the crown as Wall Street's top dog by market cap is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages of ramping, yet AWS already has $100 billion in annual run-rate sales and has captured a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend, as of the end of 2023, per Canalys. Cloud-service margins blow online retail sales margins out of the water. As AWS ramps, Amazon's operating cash flow can grow at a substantially faster pace than its total sales.\n\nAmazon's subscription services and advertising services segments should hold their own, too. The company surpassed 200 million Prime subscribers three years ago and has since added the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football and expanded its content library. The exceptional pricing power associated with Prime should meaningfully boost sales and cash flow from this segment.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon draws in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion people to its site each month, which equates to strong ad-pricing power.\n\nI fully expect Amazon's cash flow to send its valuation to north of $5 trillion over the next 11 years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nRemember the lone stock I alluded to earlier that's the only remnant from the 10 largest companies by market cap in 2000? It's software giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). I expect this cash cow of a company to retain its place in the top five over the coming decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's not-so-subtle secret to success has been its uncanny ability to blend the old with the new. For example, Windows may not be growth segment it was 25 years ago, but it remains the undisputed top global operating system by market share. Microsoft continues to generate boatloads of cash flow from legacy segments like Windows and Office and utilizes this cash to reinvest in higher-growth initiatives and acquisitions.\n\nNothing has been more important this decade to Microsoft than its cloud-service ties. Azure is the No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform behind AWS, with constant-currency sales growth pacing around 30% in recent quarters. The enterprise integration of cloud-related services among its multiple suites of products can sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft is swimming in cash. It closed out March with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated a jaw-dropping $110 billon in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. Microsoft has more than enough capital coming in to take chances on acquisitions and game-changing innovations.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nThe third-largest trillion-dollar stock by 2035, based on my prognostication, will be Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and global No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud.\n\nTime is certainly something that's going to work in Alphabet's favor. For the last nine years, Google has accounted for no less than 90% of global monthly internet search share. With Google unlikely to cede its monopoly like share of search, this should allow Alphabet's ad-driven operations to benefit from lengthy periods of economic expansion. While recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, there hasn't been one that's lasted longer than 18 months since the end of World War II.\n\nLike Amazon and Microsoft, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud is going to play a key role in Alphabet's success. Google Cloud finished up its first profitable year in 2023 and should have no trouble scaling its sales, profits, and operating margin in the years to come as businesses increase their cloud-based information technology spending.\n\nAlphabet also boasts a healthy balance sheet, with nearly $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as of March 31. It can make acquisitions or organically invest in game-changing projects without adversely impacting its bottom line or foundational operating segments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nThe company ranked fourth on my list of trillion-dollar stocks by 2035 is social media colossus Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta is the parent company behind the following ultra-popular social sites: Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Mesenger, and Threads.\n\nSimilar to Alphabet, Meta should be one of the prime beneficiaries of sustained periods of economic growth for the U.S. and global economy. Meta generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, and businesses tend to be looser with their marketing budgets when the U.S. and global economy are firing on all cylinders. With Meta's social media \"real estate\" attracting 3.24 billion daily active users in the March-ended quarter, advertisers understand they're not going to reach more eyeballs on any other platform.\n\nMeta Platforms can also benefit from its longtail growth opportunity in virtual/augmented reality, the metaverse, and AI. While Meta's Reality Labs segment is expected to be a money drain for the next couple of years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a knack for building up platforms and opening the flood gates for monetization when they're good and ready (and not before).\n\nTo somewhat keep with the theme, Meta Platforms' balance sheet gives it the luxury of making these investments in its future. Meta closed out March with $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and is pacing $77 billion in net cash generated from its operations on an annual run-rate basis.\n\n5. Visa\n\nThe fifth largest trillion-dollar stock by 2035 won't be Nvidia, which I expect will be the victim of an AI bubble-bursting event, or Apple, whose growth engine has completely stalled over the last two years. Rather, it'll be the world's leading payment processor, Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nJust as ad-driven platforms Alphabet and Meta benefit from lengthy periods of economic growth, Visa enjoys the fruits of higher enterprise and consumer spending. Since World War II ended, most economic expansions have endured multiple years, with two periods of growth surpassing the decade mark. Payment processors absolutely thrive during these expansions.\n\nWhat gives Visa a pathway to become one of the five-largest publicly traded companies by 2035 is its addressable opportunity. In addition to being the clear-cut No. 1 in market share by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the top global market for consumption), Visa has a multidecade runway in numerous emerging markets where consumers and businesses remain largely underbanked (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia). Cross-border volume has consistently grown by double-digits, which speaks to this still untapped international opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, Visa's management team has avoided the temptation of becoming a lender. Strictly focusing on payment facilitation has allowed Visa to sidestep the credit delinquencies and loan losses that arise during economic downturns and derail lending institutions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Sales Could Surge 2,026%: Here's My Pick for the Best AI Stock to Buy Now (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) took center stage when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently called it \"the defining technology of our time,\" and his company has arguably been the biggest winner through the initial phase of the generative AI boom. Nvidia shares have surged 680% since the beginning of 2023.\n\nHowever, the market is expanding rapidly, and countless companies will benefit in the long run. Indeed, Bloomberg Intelligence says generative AI sales across hardware, software, and services could soar 2,026% to $1.4 trillion by 2032. That puts investors in front of a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\n\nHere's why Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is my pick for the best AI stock to buy now.\n\nAlphabet's growth accelerated in the first quarter\n\nAlphabet reported stellar financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to especially strong momentum in Google Cloud, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income soared 57% to $23.7 billion as the company continued to optimize its cost structure. Revenue and net income growth have now accelerated for four consecutive quarters.\n\nThe chart shows first-quarter revenue growth across Alphabet's four primary product categories. Alphabet's first-quarter revenue growth across its four primary product categories.\n\nAlphabet has a strong presence in digital advertising and cloud computing\n\nGoogle Advertising includes sales from Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network. In the first quarter, ad sales declined across the Google Network, which comprises millions of third-party web properties. But sales accelerated across Google Search and YouTube. That is encouraging because those platforms form the heart of Alphabet's dominance in digital advertising, and some investors worried generative artificial intelligence (AI) could unseat the company as the search leader.\n\nHowever, Google remains the leading internet search engine as measured by referrals (i.e., search result clicks), with more than 90% market share, according to StatCounter. Additionally, YouTube is the most popular streaming service as measured by viewing time. Those platforms let Alphabet engage internet users and capture data on an immense scale. Advertisers value the company's reach and insight -- so much so that Alphabet captured 28.1% of digital ad sales last year, 6.6 percentage points more than its closest competitor.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform is the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services. Alphabet still trails Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure by a wide margin, but it gained a percentage point of market share over the past year, and the share gains could continue as the generative AI boom builds steam.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is using generative AI to boost its advertising business\n\nAlphabet is widely regarded as a leader in artificial intelligence research, but OpenAI jumped ahead in generative AI when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. Alphabet has since scrambled to regain its footing and, despite a few missteps along the way, its latest version of Gemini (released in May) could help close the gap.\n\nGemini is a multimodal generative AI model, meaning it can process text, images, videos, and code. Alphabet is weaving Gemini into its advertising ecosystem in several different ways that could strengthen its dominance. For instance, Gemini lets marketers create media assets and build campaigns using natural language, and the company is experimenting with interactive ads tailored to individual users.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet is adding AI Overviews to Google Search, a feature that uses generative AI to provide brief synopses on queried topics. The overviews also help users quickly make sense of more complex topics. On the recent earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts that AI Overviews are boosting Google Search usage and user satisfaction.\n\nAlphabet is using generative AI to boost its cloud computing business\n\nAlphabet is also using Gemini to create monetization opportunities across Google Cloud, which is the business segment comprising cloud computing services (Google Cloud Platform) and business productivity software (Google Workspace). For instance, Gemini automates tasks across Workspace applications. It can draft text in Google Docs, organize data in Google Sheets, and create presentations in Google Slides.\n\nAdditionally, Google Cloud customers can customize Gemini with Vertex AI, a machine learning platform comprising tools for training and deployment. Customers can also use Gemini to build generative AI applications that can be prompted with (and output content in) various media formats, including text, images, videos, and computer code.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai recently told analysts that Google has the \"best infrastructure\" for artificial intelligence, including custom chips called tensor processing units (TPUs) and the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. Collectively, product innovation surrounding Gemini and powerful infrastructure are bringing businesses to Google. More than 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\n\nAlphabet shares trade at a reasonable valuation\n\nGoing forward, digital ad spending is forecasted to grow at 15% annually through 2030, and the cloud computing market is projected to expand at 21% annually during the same period. Wall Street analysts anticipate slower sales growth of 10.5% annually from Alphabet, but that leaves room for upside depending on how successfully the company monetizes generative AI across its advertising and cloud computing businesses.\n\nPersonally, I think Alphabet has a good shot at exceeding the sales growth forecasted by Wall Street analysts. But its current valuation of 7.3 times sales is reasonable in either case, so investors should consider buying a small position in this AI stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Major U.S. indices are coming off a strong performance quarter following surging gains of large-cap technology stocks fueling the bull market. Despite the slight drawback in recent weeks, Wall Street analysts are positive that there’s still enough steam left in the engines before indices could experience a retraction.\n\nTech Holding Steady\n\nOn Monday, May 20 indices across the market were pursuing new records as the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.65%, reaching an intra-day record high of 16,794.87. The broader S&P 500 furthered its winning streak, gaining 0.09% and ending the trading day at 5,309.13.\n\nOn Wall Street, all eyes were on the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had caught investors off guard following its breakout performance on Friday, May 17. The Dow ended the trading day above 40,000, a new record for the 30-stock index and the first time in its nearly 128-year history.\n\nAfter the weekend, however, the Dow Jones slightly retreated, falling 196.82 points on May 20, and closing off at 39,806.77.\n\nThough retraction levels are somewhat superficial at this time, investors are hot on the heels of large-cap technology stocks and companies that are expected to begin delivering earnings results in the following weeks.\n\nThe next couple of weeks are set to be yet another eventful time on the stock market as major players such as AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are expected to deliver earnings. Company stocks gained 2% on May 20, as investors and analysts raised their pricing positions ahead of its earnings report.\n\nNvidia continues to push beyond the glass ceiling, with stocks up more than 96% since the turn of the year and already gaining more than 206% in the last 12 months. The tech and chip titan is now the third-largest on the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion.\n\nThough elsewhere, broader economic performance continues to remain volatile despite U.S. inflation trending downwards and domestic demand for products and services cools. Inflation data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in April with CPI rising 3.4% year on year, Reuters reported.\n\nSticky inflation and wage growth have left the Federal Reserve’s decision unchanged about cutting interest rates any time soon, with the federal fund rate still sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%. A potential rate cut is expected near the end of summer, as the central bank continues to gauge inflation, employment, and wage growth as key decision-makers before losing their monetary policy. 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nNew York Wall Street sign.\n\nLooking Towards Diversifying\n\nThe overactive market conditions are bringing new and old investors to consider other possibilities that could provide them with broader diversification in the tech sector. As the competition among large-cap companies continues to swell, those looking to hold a safer position could instead be looking at tech exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an opportunity to gain market share and further diversify their holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroad tech ETFs are a corner of the market that has received major attention in recent years, with holdings in companies that are directly involved in the technology industry, including networking, software, hardware, semiconductors, social media, search engine marketing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nHere’s a breakdown of five broad tech ETFs to keep on your radar this year.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF\n\n5G connectivity is taking off at full speed despite being only in the beginning stages of its lifecycle. An Ericsson Mobility Report found that more than 1.6 billion 5G smartphone subscriptions were active by the end of 2023 with a projected two billion to be active by the end of this year.\n\nThe exceptional growth of the market has meant that mobile service providers are quickly catching wind of these developments and looking to leverage larger market opportunities in the coming years.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG) shows that 5G technology and connectivity aren’t only essential for everyday communication but instead provide a stable investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their portfolios into this seemingly untapped market.\n\nThe fund has roughly 53 holdings, offering investors transparent exposure to 5G stocks and companies engaged in connectivity services, development, research, and commercialization. The underlying index tracks 48 globally-listed stocks with various market capitalizations.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, the fund has held steady, offering a 21.68% one-year return, and roughly 9.15% since inception. Total return (NAV) is slightly in line with broader market performance, with year-to-date returns of 2.77%, as of May 2024.\n\nA diverse fund holding ensures that investors obtain the necessary exposure to large-cap technology and network stocks, with iPhone maker, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) having the top spot, with 5.67% of the fund invested in Apple shares.\n\nOther notable holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO).\n\nThe Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF is more than a fund directed at network mobility. Instead, Defiance claims that this fund allows investors to gain traction in a rapidly growing industry that’s connected to more than mobile devices, but instead sees some of its biggest customers being in healthcare, finance, and data generation.\n\niShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM) is a broad technology fund with roughly 278 holdings in North American equities. The objective of the fund is to provide investors with more diversified exposure to North American equities and companies operating in the technology sector, including communication services and the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nOn top of this, the fund manages several holdings related to hardware, software, internet marketing, and interactive media. Overall, the Expanded Tech Sector ETF aims to provide North American and international investors with an expressed view of advanced technology companies and the broader tech sector.\n\nBased on current performance data, the iShares Extended Tech Sector ETF has gained roughly 10.59 since its inception back in 2001. One year total return is currently standing at 52.97%, which for some investors might seem outlandish considering the fund's broad exposure to various capital sectors.\n\nThe staggering performance of the fund can be largely attributed to its ability to invest in a large quantity of diverse tech and software companies. At the top of the list, companies such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) make up the largest portion of fund distributions.\n\nOutside of investing in major tech companies, most of which are part of the Magnificent Seven, the fund has much of its distributions held up in the semiconductor and interactive media services, investing 24.0% and 19.31% of the fund, respectively. Other sectors of importance include application and system software, and lesser-known services such as IT consulting and communication equipment.\n\nSince the turn of the year, the fund has gained 17.73%, while the broader S&P 500 has risen 11.29% YTD, and the S&P 500 Information Technology index is up by 16.24% YTD.\n\nRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\n\nAnother suitable option for investors looking to invest in large-cap high-tech companies is the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) which invests in the top 7 tech stocks and provides investors with more exposure to heavy-weight competitors.\n\nFor investors that are not yet aware, the Magnificent Seven is the collective name given to the largest, and most prominent tech companies and includes Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nIn the last couple of years, these seven trailblazing companies have helped push technology stocks to new heights, and the widespread development of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fuel the next generation of tech and software developers.\n\nMAGS offers investors pure exposure to the Magnificent Seven companies, reducing direct volatile risk exposure and weighting out portfolio distribution. On average, distribution holdings are fairly equal, although currently 16.36% is invested in Alphabet Class A shares, with Meta Platforms taking the bottom position with 12.61% fund allocation.\n\nThough the fund offers direct pure exposure to mega-cap tech stocks, seasoned professionals might be skeptical about the long-term viability of MAGS. For starters, the fund is relatively new, coming onto the market in November 2023, meaning that many investors still have limited amounts of data to clearly define their forward-looking position of the fund.\n\nSecondly, the fund solely holds seven stocks, meaning that risk distribution to return potential is seemingly higher, and can be considered a drawback for older, more seasoned investors that are looking to lower these risks and direct capital towards more buoyant long-term options.\n\nFinally, a principal investment strategy of MAGS is to invest at least 80% of its assets, including borrowings for investment purposes in the financial instruments of its holdings that provide the best exposure, or a combination of economic characteristics.\n\nThis could mean that should one of its holdings, or several others experience a significant decline in revenue, profit, market share, or market capitalization, the fund could then possibly experience declined near-term returns.\n\nThough it’s an ambitious technology fund that gives the best possible exposure to the Magnificent Seven, perhaps investors who are looking to reduce risks and mitigate near-term volatility would be best suited to opt for something more geared towards their forward-looking goals.\n\nVanEck Robotics ETF\n\nOn paper, the VanECK Robotics ETF (IBOT) offers a multi-dynamic investment opportunity that sees the fund invest in large-scale technological projects and developments supported by global market demand.\n\nIBOT exposure is directed toward high-growth companies, the majority focusing on future industrial automation and technological acceleration. Based on current data, IBOT invests the majority of its capital in the information technology sector, followed by industrial and consumer discretionary. Other, smaller holdings are focused on healthcare, energy, and cash.\n\nThe fund aims to replicate the performance of the BlueState Robotics Index which tracks companies that are closely involved in the field of robotics research and development.\n\nOverall, the BlueStar Robotics Index has held steady performance, with the index rising 23.45% over the past 12 months. The BlueStar Robotics Index has distributions across the world, investing in highly developed and high-growth capital markets, including the U.S., Japan, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, among other countries.\n\nSince its inception back in April 2023, the VanEck robotics fund has gained roughly 21.39%, slightly below the 22.16% return reported by the BlueStar Robotics Index during the same period. However, a yearly return is currently reported at 22.17%, which could give a positive indication for investors looking to actively leverage the robotics industry.\n\nIn a report by the International Federation of Robotics, recent data showed that in 2023, manufacturing companies across the world, and primarily in the U.S. have heavily invested in production line and supply chain automation. During the period, robotic installations rose by 12%, reaching more than 44,300 units in 2023, with the automotive industry being the top adopter of automation and robotic equipment.\n\nOn the back of surging growth and demand, IBOT could be the link investors need to tap into the marketing of automation and robotic equipment. With both the private and public sectors now plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into the world of robotics automation, IBOT could perhaps be the turning point for novice and seasoned investors.\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nLast on the list is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) which aims to track the performance of a benchmark index through passively managed strategies, including a full-replication strategy when possible.\n\nAs the name suggests, VGT is focused on investment movement within the information technology sector with 27.60% of its weighted exposure allocated to the semiconductor sector. The systems software sector follows second, making up 22.90% of the fund, and technology hardware, storage, and peripherals take up 17.30%.\n\nAlthough these are only three of the primary sectors the fund is invested in, holdings such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Cisco Systems, and Accenture (NYSE: ACN) are among the 313 other companies that make up the broader diversification of VGT.\n\nFor the physical year-end 31 August 2023, Vanguard Information Technology ETF reported a strong turnover rate of 15.4%, while the fund currently has an earnings growth rate of 2.07%, according to recent fund information.\n\nOther performance data indicates that VGT managed to slightly outperform the benchmark one-year performance rate. VGT reported a 12-month return of 29.70%, while the benchmark return was 29.66%.\n\nFor investors who are seeking more weighted security and direct exposure to the domestic information technology sector, VGT is considered a reasonably safer option for long-term opportunities and provides a seemingly secure holdings distribution.\n\nRiding Out Uncertainty\n\nAs the bull run is expected to extend well into the coming months, looking toward the technology sector for better portfolio and performance buoyancy is becoming a sure strategic decision for investors and Wall Street investment firms.\n\nAlthough uncertainty continues to loom overhead, with geopolitical tension and tight interest rates keeping some investors at bay, those seeking to leverage current market conditions are holding steady on technology stocks and ETFs due to a positive turnaround in the market.\n\nArguably, conditions are looking surprisingly positive for both ends of the spectrum. The S&P 500 Information Technology index is above the broader S&P 500, gaining 16.24% compared to 11.29% year to date. On a quarterly basis, similar conditions are playing out, as the S&P tech sector index gained 3.34% compared to 1.02% on the S&P.\n\nMarket conditions are piping hot, and investors aren’t taking a backseat anytime soon. Yet, broader economic conditions and the possibility of a hard landing remain deciding factors for some seasoned investors who are hoping to ride out near-term volatility.\n\nFinishing Thoughts\n\nTechnology is rapidly changing the way we work and communicate, and the companies spearheading the race to innovation are casting a bright light on new opportunities on the stock market.\n\nThough there is still a lot of uncertainty up ahead, both in relation to macroeconomic conditions and the global political environment, investors should consider seeking out investments, and diverse funds that not only provide stability but offer them the necessary long and near-term broad exposure in advanced tech sectors that can ride out uncertainty,m while providing sufficient portfolio buoyancy.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: I recently initiated a small position in Tesla, no other positions in any other positions mentioned.\n\nRelated Content\n\n10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now Should You Hold Nvidia (NVDA)?

In case you were sunning yourself on a beach or downing hotdogs and beer instead of scrolling through Instagram (META) and X, let me get you up to speed.\n\nAI Overview is supposed to provide generative AI-based responses to search queries. Normally, it does that. But over the last week it’s also told users they can use nontoxic glue to keep cheese from sliding off their pizza, that they can eat one rock a day, and claimed Barack Obama was the first Muslim president.\n\nGoogle responded by taking down the responses and saying it’s using the errors to improve its systems. But the incidents, coupled with Google’s disastrous Gemini image generator launch that allowed the app to generate historically inaccurate images, could seriously damage the search giant’s credibility.\n\n“Google is supposed to be the premier source of information on the internet,” explained Chinmay Hegde, associate professor of computer science and engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering. “And if that product is watered down, it will slowly erode our trust in Google.”\n\nGoogle’s AI flubs\n\nGoogle’s AI Overview problems aren’t the first time the company has run into trouble since it began its generative AI drive. The company’s Bard chatbot, which Google rebranded as Gemini in February, famously showed an error in one of its responses in a promo video in February 2023, sending Google shares sliding.\n\nThen there was its Gemini image generator software, which generated photos of diverse groups of people in inaccurate settings, including as German soldiers in 1943. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., May 14, 2024. Bloopers — some funny, others disturbing — have been shared on social media since Google unleashed a makeover of its search page that frequently puts AI-generated summaries on top of search results. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAI has a history of bias, and Google tried to overcome that by including a wider diversity of ethnicities when generating images of people. But the company overcorrected, and the software ended up rejecting some requests for images of people of specific backgrounds. Google responded by temporarily taking the software offline and apologizing for the episode.\n\nThe AI Overview issues, meanwhile, cropped up because Google said users were asking uncommon questions. In the rock-eating example, a Google spokesperson said it “seems a website about geology was syndicating articles from other sources on that topic onto their site, and that happened to include an article that originally appeared on the Onion. AI Overviews linked out to that source.”\n\nThose are fine explanations, but the fact that Google continues to release products with flaws that it then needs to explain away is getting tiring.\n\nStory continues\n\n“At some point, you have to stand by the product that you roll out,” said Derek Leben, associate teaching professor of business ethics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business.\n\n“You can't just say … 'We are going to incorporate AI into all of our well-established products, and also it's in constant beta mode, and any kinds of mistakes or problems that it makes we can't be held responsible for and even blamed for,' in terms of just trust in the products themselves.”\n\nGoogle is the go-to website for finding facts online. Anytime I’ve gotten into an argument over some inane topic with a friend, one of us inevitably shouts, “Fine, Google it!” And chances are you’ve done the same. Maybe not because you wanted to prove you know some obscure Simpsons fact better than your friend, but still. The point is, Google has built a reputation of trustworthiness, and its AI flubs are slowly eating into that.\n\nA race to beat the competition\n\nSo why the slip-ups? Hegde says the company is simply moving too quickly, releasing products before they’re ready in an effort to outmaneuver competitors like Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI.\n\n“The pace of research is so quick that the gap between research and product seems to be shrinking significantly, and that is causing all these surface-level issues,” he explained.\n\nGoogle has been racing to beat back appearances that it fell behind Microsoft and OpenAI since the two teamed up to release a generative AI-powered version of its Bing search engine and chatbot in February 2023. OpenAI even managed to cut off Google ahead of its I/O developer conference earlier this month, announcing its powerful GPT-4o AI model a day before the show kicked off.\n\nBut if beating the competition means rolling out products that generate errors or harmful information, Google risks giving users the impression that its generative AI efforts can’t be trusted and, ultimately, aren't worth using.

        "title": "Virtual Victors: The Top 3 Stocks That Will Dominate the Metaverse Landscape",
        "content": "On Wall Street, reality may blur with the virtual, while investors search for top metaverse stocks.\n\nThe metaverse refers to a virtual world where users can interact, play and socialize in an immersive and interactive environment. With the rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, the metaverse is poised to revolutionize the way we live, work and play. The segment is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 41%.\n\nAs the metaverse continues to evolve, investors are seeking exposure to the companies driving this innovation with cutting-edge technologies, platforms and experiences. From gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare, the metaverse has the potential to transform industries and create new growth opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let’s delve into three top metaverse stocks to buy that are paving the way for a new era of immersive digital engagement.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is a leading innovator in haptics technology, which allows users to experience realistic touch sensations through digital devices. IMMR develops haptic feedback solutions across various industries. Those include mobile phones, automotive user interfaces and gaming peripherals. Their comprehensive portfolio enables manufacturers to integrate immersive touch feedback into their products.\n\nThe haptics technology innovator reported stellar financial results for the first quarter in April. Total revenue soared to $43.8 million, a dramatic 520% year-over-year (YOY) increase from $7.1 million. This robust performance significantly surpassed analyst estimates of $24.94 million. Net income climbed to $19.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $9.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nImmersion inked significant licensing deals in the first quarter of 2024, solidifying its market position. A February agreement granted Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) access to Immersion’s haptics patents for their hardware, software, VR, and gaming products. This deal highlighted the growing role of haptics in the metaverse. Additionally, Immersion renewed its licensing agreement with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) in March, ensuring continued use of their technology in Nintendo’s gaming products.\n\nAs a result, IMMR stock has gained 38% year-to-date (YTD), reaching multi-year highs. Shares are trading at an attractive 8.2x forward earnings and 4.4x sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $10.50 for IMMR, signaling roughly a 10% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is a real-time 3D development platform where creators can build interactive experiences. In fact, Unity’s reach extends far beyond video games. It allows a diverse set of creators to develop VR applications, architectural visualizations and automotive design simulations as well.\n\nYet, the 3D platform developer recently reported mixed financial results. Total revenues declined 8% YOY to $460.4 million, yet beat analyst estimates by 6%. Diluted net loss per share widened 12% to came in at 75 cents, higher than anticipated.\n\nIn a move poised to revolutionize the in-cabin car experience, Unity and Mazda Motor (OTCMKTS:MZDAY) have recently forged a strategic partnership. This collaboration will leverage Unity’s development platform to create a next-generation human-machine interface (HMI) and graphic user interface (GUI) for future Mazda vehicles.\n\nSo far in 2024, U stock has plunged close to 50%, while the stock is currently trading at 3.7 times sales. Yet, Wall Street remains optimistic for the prospects of U stock with a price forecast of $26, an upside of 25%. Interested investors could regard declines below $19 as opportunity to initiate positions in U shares.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nThe last top metaverse stock is the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pure-play for investing in businesses at the forefront of the metaverse market. These companies might be involved in hardware (VR headsets, haptic technology) and software development (game engines, 3D creation tools). In addition, networking infrastructure and even payment solutions that will facilitate transactions within virtual worlds enter the domain of the fund.\n\nMETV, which has 38 holdings, was launched in June 2021. The top 10 names make up about 50% of net assets of $406 million. In terms of sectors, we see gaming platform (22%) followed by computing components (19%), cloud solutions (14.9%) and video games (11.6%). About 70% of the companies are U.S.-based. Others come from China (8.7%), Japan (6.7%), South Korea (6.0%) and others. Leading holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); Roblox (NYSE:ROBLOX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nSince January, METV has returned around 10%, and recently hit a 2-year high. Yet, the current valuation appears favorable with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1x . Investors looking to capitalize on the next iteration of the internet can find the METV ETF a compelling option. Finally, potential investors should also note the expense ratio of 0.59%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry just made a big bet on gold — and dumped tech giants Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry just made a big bet on gold — and dumped tech giants Alphabet and Amazon\n\nMichael Burry’s moves tend to make headlines.\n\nThe hedge fund manager famously bet against the U.S. housing market in 2008 and won big — a move that was depicted in the hit movie “The Big Short.”\n\nSince then his investments have been closely watched.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nAccording to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Burry’s company Scion Asset Management has made quite a few adjustments to its portfolio in Q1 of 2024.\n\nAmong Burry’s notable moves were selling his stakes in Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) and increasing his holdings of Chinese companies JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA).\n\nBurry also made a substantial bet on gold by purchasing 440,729 shares of Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), valued at $7.6 million at the end of Q1, making it the fifth-largest position in his portfolio. The closed-end fund's official website says it holds “substantially all of its assets in physical gold bullion.”\n\nA unique feature of the Sprott Physical Gold Trust is that investors have the right to redeem their units for physical metals on a monthly basis, provided they meet the minimum redemption amount. This requirement is quite substantial, as \"a unitholder must have enough units to equate to one full-sized London Good Delivery bar (approximately 400 oz).\"\n\nGold’s gleaming rise\n\nGold is already experiencing a remarkable surge. At the beginning of this year, the precious metal was trading at $2,062 per ounce. Today, it’s at $2,357 per ounce, reflecting a 14.3% increase.\n\nTo put this into perspective, gold has outpaced the S&P 500, which has gained 11.7% over the same period.\n\nThere are many reasons why investors might want to add gold to their portfolios. One notable reason is inflation. Inflation often arises from central banks' ability to freely print fiat money. Gold, however, cannot be created out of thin air. Its relative scarcity and durability make it a reliable hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power when paper currency loses value.\n\nAdditionally, gold can act as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty and geopolitical tension. During periods of market volatility or global instability, investors often turn to gold for its stability and reliability. This precious metal has historically maintained its value, making it a trusted asset in uncertain times.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nFor those looking to follow Burry's lead and add a touch of gold to their portfolios, here are three easy ways to do it.\n\nBuy gold bullion\n\nThe most straightforward way to invest in gold is to buy physical gold in the form of bars or coins.\n\nGold bullion can be purchased from reputable dealers and stored securely at home or in a safety deposit box.\n\nThe advantage of owning physical gold is its stability and tangibility, providing a sense of security and ownership that isn't dependent on financial institutions. However, it requires secure storage and insurance, which can add to the overall cost of investment.\n\nInvest in gold stocks/ETFs\n\nInvestors can also purchase shares of gold mining companies. When the price of gold rises, miners tend to enjoy bigger profits, potentially boosting the value of their stocks.\n\nAdding gold mining companies to your portfolio can provide diversification. However, keep in mind that doing so also exposes investors to market risks and the performance of the underlying companies.\n\nIn addition, there are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of gold. These ETFs aim to mirror the price movements of gold by holding physical gold or gold futures contracts.\n\nBecause gold ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, investors have the ability to buy or sell shares at market prices throughout the trading day. They provide a convenient way to gain exposure to gold without the need for physical storage or dealing with the logistics of buying and selling bullion.\n\nInvest in a gold IRA\n\nIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are a popular way to save for retirement, offering tax advantages that can help grow your savings over time. Traditional IRAs allow you to contribute pre-tax income, with taxes deferred until you withdraw the funds during retirement. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, involve contributions made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\n\nA gold individual retirement account (IRA) is a specific type of IRA that allows investors to include physical gold and other precious metals in their retirement savings. This type of IRA offers the same tax advantages as traditional and Roth IRAs but provides the added benefit of diversifying your portfolio with tangible assets. Gold IRAs are appealing because gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, helping to protect your retirement savings from market volatility.\n\nThere are drawbacks, like relatively lower returns, no dividends and fees you have to pay to buy and store the actual metal.\n\nIf you believe in the yellow metal’s long-term potential, a gold IRA could be a valuable addition to your retirement strategy. However, make sure it’s only a small part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "title": "How Waymo outlasted the competition and made robo-taxis a real business",
        "content": "The road to autonomous driving is not for the faint of heart.\n\nLook behind to view the wreck of Uber’s self-driving car. In the ditch to the left is General Motors’ Cruise robo-taxi. And that scent of burning rubber? That’s from the skid marks Apple made as it careened toward the exit ramp.\n\nBut one funny-looking vehicle appears to be gaining momentum.\n\nWaymo, born 15 years ago as the “Google Self-Driving Car Project,” now offers fully autonomous rideshare services in Phoenix—where its driverless vehicles also make Uber Eats deliveries—as well as in San Francisco and part of Los Angeles; 50,000 paid Waymo rides take place across the three cities each week, the company recently announced.\n\nThat paying passengers now routinely hop into empty Waymo vehicles, which gracefully move among the surrounding jumble of human-piloted cars, is a remarkable feat of engineering and a genuine pinch-me moment for anyone who has experienced it. And while Waymo has been at it longer than most, the fact that it has become the leader in the crowded race to commercialize self-driving cars was not a given.\n\nFrederic Bruneteau, the founder of Ptolemus, a Brussels-based automation consultancy and market research firm, likens the competition in the self-driving car industry to the grueling Tour de France bicycle race: “Sometimes you see people catching up with you, and sometimes you’re getting ahead and the number of people behind you are pretty scarce. That’s what’s happened with Waymo.”\n\n50,000\n\nTotal weekly Waymo rides in L.A., Phoenix, and San Francisco. Source: Waymo\n\nAman Nalavade, Waymo’s growth and expansion chief, says a go-slow approach has proved to be the right strategy for this race. “We scale responsibly, as it’s bad business to overrun supply,” Nalavade says. For technology as novel as fully autonomous vehicles, “it takes time to build up a meaningful service and gain a community’s trust.”\n\nBut even the most bullish believers in autonomous transportation acknowledge the tech still has a ways to go before it’s reliable enough for widespread deployment on U.S. roads. And while Waymo has outlasted its rivals so far, new challenges on the regulatory and competitive front mean that it’s closer to the next phase of the race than it is to the finish line.\n\nFrom moonshot to reality\n\nGoogle launched its self-driving car program in 2009, incubating it within the X “moonshot” lab before spinning it out as a stand-alone business called Waymo (“a new way forward in mobility”) within the Alphabet parent company. The car’s physical design and functionality, as well as the team’s leadership, have gone through multiple transformations since then.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle initially designed the technology as a copilot system that allowed human drivers to let go of the controls, retaking the wheel only when necessary, but concluded the approach was unsafe. In 2015, the company began building its own pod-shaped “koala” car—a two-seater with no pedals or steering wheel—only to revert in 2017 to using modified versions of commercially available cars. Today Waymo’s fleet consists of Jaguar I-Pace electric SUVs equipped with an array of sensors.\n\nThere’s been no shortage of problems and setbacks. In December, Waymo recalled its vehicle software after two of the cars crashed into a pickup that was being towed in Phoenix. And U.S. regulators recently opened an investigation into 22 reported incidents involving Waymo cars, including 17 collisions with stationary objects such as gates and parked cars, and multiple occasions where the vehicles appeared to disobey street signs and road markings.\n\nBut whether the result of superior safeguards or mere luck, Waymo has managed to avoid the more serious road accidents that have derailed its rivals. Uber abandoned its self-driving car efforts in 2020, two years after one of its cars fatally struck a pedestrian in Arizona. A Cruise vehicle in October hit and dragged a pedestrian who had been thrown into its path after being struck by another car. Regulators made Cruise suspend its driverless operations in San Francisco, and Cruise soon halted operations nationwide.\n\n250\n\nWaymo vehicles operating in San Francisco. Source: Waymo\n\nIt was a major setback for Cruise, which, just months earlier, had gotten California regulators’ green light to offer driver-free robo-taxi services to paying customers any time of day in San Francisco. Cruise has not provided a date for when it plans to resume its robo-taxi passenger service, but recently began testing cars with human safety drivers in Arizona again.\n\nApple, meanwhile, called it quits in February, shutting down an expensive yearslong project that never reached the point of testing without human safety drivers on public roads.\n\nWaymo’s ability to “mostly stay clear of trouble,” along with its steady geographical expansion and its investors’ deep pockets, has put the robo-taxi operation “into a very good position,” says Pedro Pacheco, a vice president of research at Gartner. While other autonomous driving companies might be tempted to move too fast in order to justify themselves to their investors, he adds, Waymo’s situation as a mostly autonomous sister company to the cash-generating Google gives it “the comfort to take a somewhat cautious pace of growth.”\n\nWhat comes next\n\nThe heat may soon be on again, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised that his company will reveal its own robo-taxi in early August.\n\nTesla has so far not been a direct competitor to Waymo—its fallaciously named “full self-driving” (FSD) technology is more akin to an advanced driver-assist system, requiring a human driver to be attentive at all times (known as Level 2 autonomy in industry jargon, versus Waymo’s Level 4 vehicles, and Level 5, the highest).\n\nWhile the two companies’ vehicles use different hardware to navigate the roads—Teslas rely solely on cameras; Waymo cars draw data from cameras plus radar and lidar laser sensors—AI will play an increasingly important role.\n\nTesla’s fleet of hundreds of thousands of vehicles constantly feed data to the company’s neural networks so that its FSD software can learn to drive more like humans do. This year’s version of the software, FSD 12, is the first to let the neural network make decisions about driving. According to Gartner’s Pacheco, Tesla’s self-learning approach is a “hint of the direction in which this is heading, and now an AI breakthrough could unlock a lot of new possibilities for autonomous vehicles.”\n\nWaymo’s Nalavade says AI “has long been a part of our stack, but its role has grown massively in recent years.” The progress in AI, he notes, has made Waymo’s recent expansion possible by allowing its systems to “generalize”—to apply previously learned lessons to new environments, rather than having to start from scratch in each new place. “The Waymo Driver [system] is capable of generalizing to dozens more cities tomorrow, but we’re focused on building a valuable ride-hailing service that people want to use in the cities [in which] we operate,” he says.\n\nWhile an imminent Tesla robo-taxi has many doubters given Musk’s history of overly optimistic timelines, there are plenty of other players with no intention of ceding the future of automobiles to Waymo. Amazon subsidiary Zoox has a robo-taxi currently shuttling employees to work in certain locations. Automakers like Ford, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz are driving hard (often in partnership with startups) toward Level 3 systems, which still require occasional human intervention. And China’s rising band of automakers have various projects in the works.\n\n“We’re far from getting to the final chapter of robo-taxis,” says Pacheco.\n\nThis article appears in the Jun/July 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline \"How Waymo steered to the front of the pack and made self-driving taxis a reality.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Conor Humphries\n\nDUBLIN (Reuters) - The world's leading internet firms are engaging extensively with regulators in the European Union to ensure their artificial-intelligence products do not fall foul of the bloc's strict data protection rules, Ireland's powerful data regulator said.\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission, lead EU regulator for Alphabet's Google, Meta, Microsoft, TikTok and OpenAI, among others, said that its broad powers had not yet been tested on AI and it could in future force changes to business models to ensure data privacy is protected.\n\nAI creates a number of potential issues for data privacy, the two top officials at Ireland's Data Protection Commission said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nRegulators need to decide whether companies should be allowed to trawl the internet for public data to train AI models, and on what legal basis personal data can be used.\n\nAI operators also need to explain they can ensure individuals' data rights, including the right to erase their data. The risk of AI models giving incorrect personal data about individuals must also be addressed, the Irish officials said.\n\n\"There has been extensive engagement\" from leading U.S. tech firms including Google, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn and OpenAI, said Dale Sunderland, one of the Irish regulator's two Data Protection Commissioners.\n\n\"They're seeking our views on some of their new products in the AI space, particularly the large language model space.\"\n\nGoogle agreed to delay and make changes to its Gemini AI chatbot following consultations with the Irish regulator, he said.\n\nWhile Ireland is the lead regulator for most of the top U.S. internet firms due to the location of their EU head offices in the country, other regulators can have a say in decisions via the European Data Protection Board, which is currently working on guidance on how AI should operate under EU data protection law, he said.\n\nAI model operators from next month will have to comply with the EU's landmark new AI Act. But they will also have to comply with the bloc's key data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which can impose fines of up to 4% of a firm's total global turnover.\n\n\"The power of national regulators, including us, is quite broad,\" said Des Hogan, Ireland's other Data Protection Commissioner and chair of the commission.\n\n\"If they haven't done proper due diligence around the impacts of new products or services ... they run that risk of having to change the design downstream.\"\n\n(Reporting by Conor Humphries in Dublin; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is composed of 500 stocks from 11 different sectors, including information technology, energy, financials, and real estate. While it is the most diversified of the major U.S. stock market indexes, a select few technology stocks are having a growing influence over its performance thanks to their meteoric rise in value.\n\nAs of this writing, the following five companies have a combined market capitalization of $12.5 trillion, accounting for 27.3% of the total value of the entire S&P 500:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $2.9 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $2.8 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $1.9 trillion.\n\nThe S&P 500 index is up 11.5% in 2024 so far. However, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index -- which assigns an equal weighting to every stock regardless of its market cap -- is up just 4.9%. The difference can be explained (in large part) by the average year-to-date gain of 26.3% in the above five stocks, which highlights their influence over the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are using that experience (and their vast financial resources) to dominate new industries like artificial intelligence (AI). If they succeed, they could become even more influential over the S&P 500.\n\n1. Microsoft: 7.2% of the S&P 500\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company. It was founded in 1975, and some of its flagship products like Windows and Word are still used by billions of people today. Microsoft has expanded beyond software and into gaming, hardware (computers and devices), internet search, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the company agreed to invest $10 billion in AI start-up OpenAI, which created the ChatGPT online chatbot. Microsoft is integrating OpenAI's technology into most of its products to deliver more value for users. The Bing search engine, for example, now features a chatbot interface, and applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel are benefiting from AI's ability to rapidly craft content from text to videos.\n\nMicrosoft has cemented itself as a leader in AI thanks to the OpenAI partnership, and its products will continue to benefit from the start-up's lightning-paced innovation.\n\n2. Apple: 6.2% of the S&P 500\n\nApple makes some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, with 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. That includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. The iPhone also led to successful, billion-dollar spinoff devices like the Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's enormous installed base makes it the perfect distributor of AI software to consumers. The latest iPhone 15 Pro already comes with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, designed to process some AI workloads on-device. The company is reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet to decide which AI models will power its future devices, so consumers should expect its next iteration of chips to come with even greater processing capabilities.\n\nEventually, devices like the iPhone might come with advanced AI assistants capable of answering complex questions and crafting emails and social media content (among other things). Modern smartphones are simply pocket-sized computers, and, generally speaking, they have made humanity far more productive. AI is set to accelerate that trend.\n\n3. Nvidia: 5.9% of the S&P 500\n\nGenerative AI is developed, trained, and deployed in large, centralized data centers. Nvidia designs the graphics processing chips (GPUs) that fill those data centers, and they are the most sought-after in the industry among AI developers. During fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU drove the company's data center revenue to $47.5 billion, which was a whopping 217% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company just reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), and growth in its data center revenue accelerated to 427%. The H100 buoyed sales, but shipments of the new H200 GPU are set to begin in Q2. It can inference (the process of feeding live data to an AI model so it can make predictions) twice as fast as the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which could trigger another demand wave from leading data center operators like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\n\nIn essence, Nvidia remains far ahead of its competitors, and the development of next-generation AI models won't be possible without its GPUs. The company plans to launch a new series of chips later this year that are built on its latest Blackwell architecture, and they will deliver even greater performance.\n\n4. Alphabet: 4.3% of the S&P 500\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, and it's also home to other tech subsidiaries like YouTube, autonomous driving company Waymo, and AI developer DeepMind. Google Search remains Alphabet's largest source of revenue, but investors have questioned whether AI chatbots could unseat its dominance, given their ability to provide an instant answer to practically any question.\n\nData is king when it comes to AI, and since Google Search has been the window to the entire internet for more than two decades, it has more valuable information than practically any company on Earth. This allowed Alphabet to develop its own AI models, culminating in its latest Gemini lineup, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4 models. In some tests, Gemini is as good, if not better, at understanding and generating text, images, videos, and computer code.\n\nGoogle also embedded generative AI into its traditional search engine, which provides the user with a text-based answer at the top of the page to save them from sifting through web results to find the information they need. Alphabet's AI initiatives are resonating with investors, who have catapulted the company into the exclusive $2 trillion club this year.\n\n5. Amazon: 3.7% of the S&P 500\n\nAmazon is best known as an e-commerce company, and online sales remain its largest source of revenue. But the company has branched out into streaming, digital advertising, robotics, and cloud computing (among other things), which have all contributed to the company's position on this list. In fact, its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the biggest in the industry, and it's home to a growing number of AI services.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy wants AWS to dominate the three layers of AI. There is the infrastructure layer, the model layer, and the application layer. To achieve this, the company now designs its own AI chips for the data center, it offers a growing portfolio of ready-made large language models (LLMs), including some it developed in-house, and it recently launched a generative AI assistant called Q, which can help businesses extract more value from the AWS platform.\n\nAmazon also uses AI in its core e-commerce platform to recommend products to customers and to help advertisers craft engaging content. Simply put, this is one of the most diversified companies an investor can own during the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI is in the crosshairs at Meta and Alphabet annual meetings as shareholders vote for detailed reports",
        "content": "Generative AI is on the ballot at Big Tech companies like Meta and Alphabet, as shareholders vote on proposals calling for detailed reports by the companies about how the technology is being used to create and spread misinformation. The shareholder proposals, which will be voted on at each company’s upcoming annual general meeting, reflect growing concerns about the power and prevalence of generative AI.\n\nThe votes come as Google has faced massive blowback over the past week for its new search AI features, which has produced false and often bizarre responses, including telling users to put glue on pizza. Audio and video deepfakes created by AI technology are also proliferating online, raising concerns in an election year.\n\nShareholders in Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, will vote at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday, while investors in Google-parent company Alphabet will weigh in at the company’s annual meeting on June 7. The resolutions come just a few months after a similar proposal at Microsoft’s AGM on December 7, 2023, which was presented by Nirvana co-founder and bassist Krist Novoselic and garnered 21% of the shareholder vote.\n\nThe three proposals were led by ESG activist investor group Arjuna Capital and focus on concerns that generative AI threatens to amplify misinformation and disinformation around the world, particularly during a critical election year in countries like the US and India. A separate shareholder proposal brought to Apple focused on the risks of AI to workers, which was filed by the AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, the largest labor union federation in the US. While the proposal was ultimately voted down by Apple shareholders at its annual meeting in February, proponents of AI transparency won a victory beforehand when the SEC ruled that companies like Apple could not bar shareholders from voting on such matters.\n\nIn the proxy statement for Meta's annual meeting, the shareholder proposal states that \"with Meta’s recent development of gAI products, including conversational assistants and advertising tools, the company is increasingly at risk from misinformation and disinformation generated through its own products.\"\n\nThe proposal calls for the Meta board to “issue a report, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary or legally privileged information, to be published within one year of the Annual Meeting and updated annually thereafter, assessing the risks to the Company’s operations and finances, and to public welfare, presented by the Company’s role in facilitating misinformation and disinformation disseminated or generated via generative Artificial Intelligence; what steps the Company plans to take to remediate those harms; and how it will measure the effectiveness of such efforts.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its response urging shareholders to reject the proposal, Meta pointed to its “five pillars of Responsible AI” which are overseen by its board of directors, as well as its investments in safety and security efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation.\n\n“Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders,” the Proxy Report said.\n\nIn a response to a similar proposal, Alphabet said that its Board of Directors recommended a vote against the stockholder proposal because “Our enterprise risk frameworks, product policies, and tools provide a foundation for identifying and mitigating AI-generated mis/disinformation and other potential risks,” adding that “we continually strive to improve the quality of our generative AI models and applications through both pre-launch testing and ongoing fine-tuning, and we are transparent about our ongoing work via public reporting.”\n\nThe proposals for AI reports at Meta and Alphabet are unlikely to be approved, as both companies have dual class stock that concentrates the voting power in the hands of the founders. Still, the proposals carry symbolic power and have the potential to send a message to management if they earn widespread support from shareholders.\n\nAt December’s Microsoft AGM, Novoselic served as the spokesperson for the shareholder initiative, describing himself as a long-time shareholder. He accused the company of racing forward, “releasing this nascent technology without the appropriate guardrails.” Generative AI, he continued, “is a game-changer, there’s no question, but the rush to market seemingly prioritizes short term profits over long-term success.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "HubSpot (HUBS) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why",
        "content": "HubSpot (HUBS) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of sales and marketing software maker HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) jumped 9.5% in the morning session after CNBC's David Faber confirmed rumors that Alphabets is in talks to acquire the company. Faber added, \"There have been many reports about HubSpot being in conversations with Google...My understanding is absolutely true, all stock deal for Alphabet to acquire HubSpot.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy HubSpot? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nHubSpot's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 9 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about 2 months ago, when the stock gained 9.4% after Reuters reported that Google expressed interest in acquiring the company. According to sources, Alphabet (Google's parent company) is in talks with investment bankers about a potential offer.\n\nFollowing the news, Wall Street analysts weighed in on the development, with Stifel analyst expressing reservations regarding the deal. \"We believe this would be heavily challenged by regulators given the DOJ already has two suits pending against the company across its Search business and its Ad Tech practices.\" Stifel also touched on the potential merits of the deal, noting, \"In our view, Google would be able to leverage its rich data assets that are aggregated across Gmail, its market-leading digital advertising products (Search, YouTube, network, etc.), and its small but growing Cloud business (Hubs might entice more GCP usage)....We also believe this acquisition could help Google's position in digital advertising with greater ability to leverage first-party data, all in one platform, as Google looks to purge third-party cookies on Chrome later this year.\"\n\nHubSpot is up 18.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $647.76 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $682.02 from April 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of HubSpot's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,485.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest five-year agreement between Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and FWD Group Holdings Limited (“FWD”). The agreement is the extension of the latter’s cloud technology collaboration with AWS.\r\n\r\nThis highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.\r\n\r\nPer the agreement, AWS has become the strategic cloud provider of insurance company FWD. In order to support its cloud-first strategy, FWD intends to leverage AWS’s cloud computing capabilities, agility and scalability.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS’s customer base.\r\n\r\nAWS’s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Brightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter’s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\n\nWe believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS’s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\n(NOTE: This article is being reissued to correct an error.

        "title": "Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) Is One Of The Best Shipbuilding Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds",
        "content": "In this piece, we'll look at one of the top hedge fund shipbuilding stocks and one of the biggest shipbuilding companies in the world. We've also made a full, free list of all the largest shipbuilding companies in the world, and you can check it out by reading 15 Biggest Shipbuilding Companies in the World.\n\nShips are one of the integral components of the global transportation industry. As the population grows and living conditions improve, there will be more demand for goods, which is expected to drive the demand for goods transportation by sea. Moreover, the tourism industry is also driving demand for cruise ships and ferries. For example, mega oil tankers are responsible for maintaining a supply chain that allows millions of barrels of oil to be shipped around the globe every day. These firms can benefit from stable demand and generate profits, which makes them good investment opportunities. There are, many oil tanker stocks that pay dividends, such as Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK). Genco's forward annual dividend yield is 3.83%, higher than tech giant Google's parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nFueling these large industrial bases is the global shipbuilding industry, which according to research reports can grow to be worth as much as $220 billion by 2023 end and $279 billion in 2028. Most shipbuilding companies are concentrated in a few advanced industrial nations. Out of the top 15 shipbuilding countries in the world, Japan, Korea, and China accounted for 94.2% of global ship output as of 2021. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's (UNCTAD) data for 2023 shows that Asia maintained its global edge, accounting for 95% of global ship production.\n\nWhen looking at the top shipbuilding countries, the geographical concentration allows us to identify the biggest shipbuilding companies in the world. Since building ships requires large amounts of capital expenditures, some of the largest shipbuilding firms are subsidiaries of other companies. However, some companies are also independent and publicly-traded, such as the South Korean Hanwha Ocean Co., Ltd. (KRX:042660.KS). Hanwha Ocean is worth more than $7 billion, and the stock is up 40.6% over the past 12 months and 27.5% year-to-date. The firm is currently eyeing expansion in the lucrative Pacific shipbuilding market that has seen fresh interest after U.S. military partnerships under the AUKUS program (a trilateral partnership between the US, Australia, and South Korea) sought to grow capabilities aimed at countering the Chinese.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother beneficiary of this partnership is the Australian defense and shipbuilding firm Austal Limited (ASX:ASB.AX). Austal is one of Australia's largest shipbuilding companies and it raked in A$1.5 billion ($1.0 billion) in revenue during its last fiscal year. It is a key US and Australian partner for the AUKUS program and has received multiple contracts from Australian and US navies for patrol boats and landing craft. An Australian contract in November 2023 ordered two patrol boats for A$157 million ($104 million) and later its US division kicked off work on building patrol boats for the US Navy under a $91.5 million contract. Moreover, Austal had a takeover offer from Hanwha, which it rejected, but which also boosted the stock by 14%.\n\nAs a whole, the global shipbuilding industry is divided into categories such as oil tankers, defense products, and cargo vessels. Within these, the container ship industry has faced a lot of criticism due to its contribution to global emissions. These ships account for 3% of all of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and the heat that the industry has faced due to the emissions has also led to interesting shipbuilding solutions. For example, Schooner Apollonia is a ship that relies on wind to remove trucks and polluting fuel out of the equation for some beer shipments between Kingston and New York City. On the commercial side, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) shared in January that \"30 large commercial vessels in operation with WPT [wind-assisted propulsion technologies] installed, a further eight wind-ready ships and 16 more large vessels installations pending\" were responsible for 2.2 million dead weight tons (dwt) of shipping capacity.\n\nFinally, a smaller piece of the global shipbuilding industry is the cruise ship sector. The global cruise industry is estimated by some to grow to $15 billion by 2028 end, and after the coronavirus pandemic, analysts also believe that cruise companies might continue to benefit from strong demand.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at one of the biggest shipbuilding companies in the world.\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) Is One Of The Best Shipbuilding Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) raked in $11.5 billion in revenue over the last four quarters. This not only made it one of the largest shipbuilding companies in the world, but also made it America's largest shipbuilding company.\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is one of the most important shipbuilding firms in the U.S. This is because it makes aircraft carriers and submarines. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) reported its first-quarter earnings in April and managed to beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $2.79 billion and $3.53, respectively. The company posted $2.8 billion in revenue and $3.53 in EPS. However, the stock dipped on the back the earnings release on the back of concerns regarding cost controls.\n\nInsider Monkey took a look at hedge fund investment filings for the first quarter of 2024 and found that 31 held stakes in Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII).

        "title": "How Google’s malfunctioning AI risks ruining the internet",
        "content": "google ai\n\nHow many rocks a day should you eat? Toddlers learn fairly quickly that the answer is zero, perhaps from experience, perhaps after being scolded by a parent. But ask the world’s biggest search engine and you might get a different answer.\n\n“According to UC Berkeley geologists, you should eat at least one small rock a day,” Google confidently replied to some users last week, when asked the question.\n\n“They say that rocks are a vital source of vitamins and minerals that are important for digestive health.”\n\nThe case was not an isolated incident. Last week, Google also told search engine users that Barack Obama was America’s first Muslim president. When asked to name foods ending in “um”, it answered: “Applum, Banana, Strawberrum, Tomatum and Coconut.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoogle had not been hacked, but the real explanation was potentially more troubling. The internet giant had launched a new artificial intelligence (AI) answer feature that it hopes will be the future of its search engine.\n\nGoogle recently announced that it would start adding “AI Overviews” at the top of the billions of searches carried out each day. Whereas the company would have once linked to an array of websites that might be able to answer the query, it will instead use AI to summarise authoritative sources, providing a simple answer.\n\nThe feature has been widely introduced to US users and is due to be launched worldwide by the end of the year. But it has got off to a poor start. Users shared examples of haywire answers over the weekend, including putting glue on a pizza to make the cheese stick to its base.\n\nGoogle insisted the cases were not typical of how the tool functioned. “The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high-quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,” a spokesman said. “Many of the examples we’ve seen have been uncommon queries, and we’ve also seen examples that were doctored or that we couldn’t reproduce.”\n\nEngineers have spent recent days manually altering the queries that went viral online. The company said it had rigorously tested the feature over recent months and that it had built on decades of experience building the world’s most popular search engine.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it was not the number of embarrassing queries that raised concerns so much as their nature. Since the release of ChatGPT more than 18 months ago, it has been widely understood that AI systems “hallucinate”, making up facts in a way that exposes their lack of understanding. Google’s AI Overview did not so much hallucinate as draw on sources that no human would endorse.\n\nThe advice to eat rocks, for example, came from The Onion, a satirical news website. The recommendation to put glue on pizza was based on a joke from social network site Reddit 11 years ago. Its insistence that Barack Obama was a Muslim was based on a misinterpretation of an academic book about religion in America.\n\nIn one case – when Google claimed there was no African country beginning with the letter K – its answer appeared to have been based on a web discussion of ChatGPT getting the same question wrong. In other words, AI is now using other AI fabrications as gospel.\n\nThe fact that Google, which has a 25-year track record of directing people to the best sites, appeared unable to distinguish between authoritative sources and jokes could undermine trust in the company’s answers.\n\nGoogle has had AI flubs before. Earlier this year it was forced to suspend its Gemini chatbot’s ability to draw pictures of humans after the system would generate historically inaccurate images of black Nazis and Native American Vikings. Google suspended some features on its Gemini chatbot after it generated pictures of black Nazis and Native American Vikings\n\nChief executive Sundar Pichai apologised after the bot also took a series of strange stances, such as refusing to condemn paedophilia and equating Elon Musk to Hitler. Microsoft has also given inaccurate AI-powered results in its search engine, Bing, which is powered by ChatGPT technology.\n\nBut Google is on a different scale.\n\nThe company has a search engine market share of more than 90pc, according to Statcounter. Google is the world’s most popular website – the default on iPhones and the Chrome browser. Its parent company, Alphabet, took in $175bn (£137bn) in sales last year, making it the world’s biggest billboard. That scale has pushed Google to bring down the server costs of delivering AI answers by 80pc, which critics suggest may have reduced the quality of answers.\n\nUnlike other AI embarrassments, Google has not backtracked, perhaps because it knows it can never guarantee accuracy. It is also under pressure to plough ahead, fearing that AI rivals such as ChatGPT might eat its lunch if it does not push AI into its services.\n\n“AI threatens search’s core proposition by being more efficient than the search process in many ways, but is currently less verifiably accurate,” says Claire Holubowskyj, of Enders Analysis. “Google is scrambling to find the right balance before a competitor disintermediates its hugely valuable search product.”\n\nBut Google changing how its search engine works has also led to fears about the future of the web.\n\nFor years, the company has had a loose, unwritten contract with web publishers such as news sites, forums and blogs: it would mine them for information, and in return the search engine would send millions of users their way. An AI that answers people’s questions directly has raised fears that clicks from Google will plummet, threatening the business models that support websites.\n\n“This destroys the natural symbiosis of the web,” said James Rosewell, of Movement for an Open Web, a campaign group for the marketing industry. “If publishers can’t reach audiences they won’t create content – it’s that simple.\n\n“Google is using its monopoly power to try and enclose the open web, but in doing so they threaten the very model on which the internet is built.”\n\nGoogle has said that it will “remain focused on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators” and that the AI results encourage users to “dig deeper” by following links.\n\nThe company has a vested interest in being right: if Google stops feeding the websites that depend on it, it might end up relying on increasingly low-quality data – and recommend doing worse than eating rocks.",

        "title": "The ‘Perfect 10’ List: Alphabet and Alibaba Are Among the Top-Scoring Stocks on TipRanks",
        "content": "Successful investing is all about building the right portfolio, populating it with stocks that will generate solid returns over the long run. Sounds simple, right? The only ‘trick’ is finding stocks that fit that profile, and the key is right in front of us, waiting in the raw data of the stock market.\n\nTherein lies the rub. The markets toss up a huge volume of information, based on thousands of traders dealing in thousands of stocks – the result is millions of transactions every day, and it’s the work of a lifetime to make sense of it all. Even Wall Street’s best analysts will usually focus on a segment of the whole.\n\nThis is where the TipRanks Smart Score comes in. It’s a data sorting and collating tool, based on a combination of AI and natural language processing, designed to gather all the data on any given stock and then compare that stock’s performance to a set of factors known as accurate predictors of future outperformance. The stock’s comparison results are then distilled into a single score, on a scale of 1 to 10. A stock that rings in at a ‘Perfect 10’ is one that has definitely earned additional investor interest.\n\nThat’s especially true when market-leading companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are picking up the ‘Perfect 10’ Scores. We’ve used the TipRanks database to look up the bigger picture on both; these top-scoring stocks also bring Strong Buy ratings and double-digit upside potentials to the table. Here are the details.\n\nAlphabet\n\nFirst up, a giant of the tech world. Best known as the parent company of both Google and YouTube – Alphabet is the leader in the world of online search and holds a dominant position in online advertising and video content distribution. The company recently became just the fourth Wall Street firm to surpass $2 trillion in market cap, and is one of just six publicly traded companies with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. Currently, Alphabet is valued at $2.17 trillion.\n\nGiven its overall strong position in tech, Alphabet is at the forefront of development in the AI field, and is applying generative AI to its Google search engine, and to its Google Cloud subscription service. Alphabet even has an autonomous driving division, Waymo, that has put AI-based self-driving vehicles on the streets of San Francisco.\n\nAt the financial bottom line, Alphabet’s earnings have been on an upward trajectory for the past year. In the company’s most recent earnings report, covering 1Q24, Alphabet reported $1.89 in EPS, up from $1.17 in the prior year and 38 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company’s revenues, which totaled $80.54 billion and beat the forecast by $1.84 billion, were powered by advertising revenue. Ad revenue for the quarter came to $61.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this – the solid business model, the tech leadership, and the strong finances – have caught the attention of Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth, who writes of Alphabet, “Search and Advertising revenue will continue to see accelerating growth, and the ongoing integration of AI functionality will continue to drive its leadership position across all key technology trends and business lines. GOOGL continues to benefit from strong advertising revenue and user engagement, driving another quarter of strong results across all key business lines, including Cloud, which continues to benefit from increasing AI integration.”\n\nThe 5-star analyst goes on to give these shares a Buy rating with a $210 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 20%. (To watch Feinseth’s track record, click here)\n\nLike most tech giants, Alphabet has picked up plenty of Wall Street recommendations – no fewer than 37, with 32 Buys and 5 Holds to back up the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in GOOGL are selling for $174.99 and the $197.53 average target price implies a gain of nearly 13% in the next 12 months. (See GOOGL stock forecast)\n\nAlibaba\n\nNext up is Alibaba, best known as the ‘Amazon of China.’ That’s a bit unfair, really. Alibaba is a powerful online retail and services tech company in its own right. The company’s founder is the near-legendary Chinese tech entrepreneur and innovator Jack Ma, and his creation is the absolute leader in China’s domestic online retail market. The company has been in business since 1999, and has branched out beyond China’s borders, and beyond ecommerce.\n\nThe company does offer a wide range of online retail services on the global market, and has moved into other tech sectors, including digital media, entertainment, and cloud computing. The company has several business segments, including innovation initiatives, but its chief business remains the Chinese Commerce segment.\n\nThat core business gives Alibaba a solid foundation to stand on. China has a population of approximately 1.4 billion, including approximately 800 million in its expanding urban regions. In its domestic market, Alibaba offers an unparalleled range of products and boasts that it can deliver anything to anywhere in China, with guaranteed next-day or 2-day delivery. The company’s global online retail side features nearly 6,000 product categories and over 200,000 suppliers making more than 200 million products available in over 200 countries.\n\nAlibaba last reported financial results for fiscal 4Q24, which ended on March 31 of this year. The company’s top line came to $30.73 billion, up 7% from the prior fiscal year Q4 and some $310 million over the estimates. The company’s bottom line was reported as $1.40 by non-GAAP measures, missing the forecast by 2 cents per share.\n\nThis retail and tech company attracted a review from Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang, who thinks BABA’s strengths outweigh potential headwinds. Jiang writes, “Key drivers for the next leg of the stock, in our view, are 1) sustainability of positive market share dynamics, 2) ecommerce monetization improvement driven by new ad product launch (slated in F2H25) to close the gap of CMR and GMV; and 3) reaccelerated cloud growth bolstered by AI cloud (F2H25). Uncertainty remains in light of 1) GMV growth largely depends on consumer sentiment (recently improving); 2) investment may create profitability volatility in the near Qs and FY25. Net net, we are incrementally more comfortable for a potential full-fledged turnaround playing out in F2H25 along with a stabilizing macro backdrop.”\n\nFor Jiang, another of the Street’s 5-star stock pros, these shares have earned a Buy rating, along with a $118 price target that suggests a 45% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Jiang’s track record, click here)\n\nBABA’s 17 recent stock reviews include 14 Buys to 3 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, and the average target price, of $103.46, implies an upside of 27% from the current share price of $81.26.

        "title": "4 Solid Stocks to Gain From Nasdaq's New Milestone",
        "content": "The Nasdaq rally is in full swing after a brief pause in April as concerns over inflation and uncertainty over rate cuts grew. However, Nasdaq has been the least impacted by these and has continued its dream run after a solid 2023.\n\nOn May 24, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at an all-time high of 16,920.79. This was Nasdaq’s 12th all-time high of 2024. In fact, Nasdaq has been driving the broader market rally since the past year.\n\nRally Driven by AI Optimism\n\nThe Nasdaq has gained 12.7% year to date after rallying 43.4% in 2023 to record its best year since 2023. The rally is primarily being driven by the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI.\n\nThe AI revolution is being spearheaded by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, the largest manufacturer of generative AI chipsets, which has led several big and small tech players to explore the space.\n\nNVIDIA’s robust first-quarter earnings have further fueled the expectations of investors surrounding AI and its potential. Several experts believe that AI is still in its nascent stage, and its full potential is yet to be realized.\n\nThis has seen other tech companies shift focus toward AI.\n\nAdditionally, the advancement of smart devices is driving the expansion of the AI space, as they necessitate computing and learning capabilities for tasks such as face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nThese functions demand high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphics processors and solutions, all of which foster favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry's growth.\n\nMoreover, while uncertainties about rate cuts have caused concerns, the Federal Reserve stated earlier this month that further interest rate hikes are unlikely. High-interest rates typically have a negative impact on growth assets like technology stocks, and the Federal Reserve's comments were well received by investors.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation,Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW that have a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 893.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.7% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare and others.\n\nAlphabet’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 31.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.4% over the past 60 days. GOOGL presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 52.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 7.5% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. offers network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide. PANW’s next-generation firewall products deliver natively integrated application, user, and content visibility and control through its operating system, hardware and software architecture.\n\nPalo Alto Networks’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23.9%.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Alphabet and Arista Networks",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 28, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL and Arista Networks ANET.\n\nNVIDIA Stock: Cheaper Than It Was a Year Ago\n\nNvidiareported earnings this week and posted another quarter of stunning growth, beating analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom line and announcing a ten-for-one stock split.\n\nNvidia continues to completely dominate the AI infrastructure industry, providing all the major technology businesses of the world with the GPUs and data center products required to run the extremely demanding models.\n\nThe word \"dominating\" almost doesn't capture the influence this company is having on the industry, and its outrageous growth rates are truly something to behold.\n\nQuarterly revenue of $26 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and 262% YoY, while Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was up 23% on the quarter and 427% on the year.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $14.8 billion and is up 628% YoY. To put that growth into perspective, Nvidia's total annual revenue in 2021 was $16 billion, which is now about how much profit they make in just a quarter!\n\nCan investors Still Buy Nvidia Stock at These Elevated Levels?\n\nSometimes in the market we see growth stocks with great stories, and huge growth projections go on incredible runs in a short period, only to fall back to earth when the growth doesn't materialize. That is not what's happening at Nvidia.\n\nGrowth at Nvidia has already been realized with sales and earnings having already climbed many multiples over just the last year, and with more to come.\n\nAs of right now sales for this year are expected to increase 77.6% to $108 billion, but next year's sales growth is still fairly tepid, with forecasts of 20.5%. While this year's estimates are lofty, analysts remain grounded as they look further out.\n\nWith just 20% growth projected for next year, we could even see more upside surprises.\n\nWhen looking at relative valuations, Nvidia is actually cheaper than it was a year ago. At the beginning of 2023, NVDA was trading at a forward earnings multiple of about 90x, while today it is trading at 45.3x FY24 earnings estimates and just 36x FY25 earnings estimates.\n\nHow Is Nvidia Stock Cheaper Today?\n\nWhile yes, Nvidia's stock has appreciated nearly 4x over the last year, earnings have outpaced that growth! Earnings are up nearly 6x in that time, and margins have expanded from 18.5% to 54.3%.\n\nWith those growth rates, and improved business fundamentals, you could argue that Nvidia deserves an even richer earnings multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Steadily Climbing Earnings Estimates\n\nI don't know about other research publications, but at Zacks we have been all over Nvidia this last year. In the chart below we can see that earnings estimates began to rise in Q2 2023, and at that time it jumped onto the Zacks Rank.\n\nIt has enjoyed a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating for nearly that entire time, besides occasional periods of dropping down to a Rank #2, when analysts took breaks from upgrading it.\n\nA number of contributors here have been pounding the table about buying Nvidia stock, and if you look back, I have published a number of bullish writeups over the last year.\n\nWhich Other Stocks can I buy for AI Exposure?\n\nEven with the reasons shared here, many investors will still resist buying Nvidia stock, and I do understand the psychological difficulties with buying a stock that has rallied so much already. So, for those investors I will share my other top picks to ride the AI wave.\n\nAlphabet has quickly jumped near the front of the AI expansion. At its most recent developer conference, Alphabet shared a number of exciting new AI integration to its suite of products.\n\nAI Agents, they call them, will act as an assistant across Gmail, Search, and Android devices.\n\nAlphabet also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, as well as a historically discounted valuation. Trading at 22.8x forward earnings, it is below its 10-year median of 26.2x.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock has been showing considerable relative strength against most of the other mega-cap technology stocks, outperforming all the Magnificent Seven excluding Nvidia in the last three months.\n\nAnother AI beneficiary with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is Arista Networks.\n\nLess well known than most of its AI counterparts, Arista Networks specializes in high-performance, software-driven network switches and routers for data centers, cloud computing, and large-scale enterprise environments.\n\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in the AI boom by providing the advanced networking infrastructure required for AI workloads. Its high-speed, low-latency switches and routers facilitate the efficient data flow and massive computational power needed for AI and machine learning applications.\n\nNot everyone has missed this quiet AI-winner though, as analysts have been steadily raising earning estimates over the last year, and the stock has rallied nearly 100% over the last year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn just the last two days I have had a number of people reaching out and asking, \"is it too late to buy Nvidia?\" And my answer is no, it probably isn't too late.\n\nOf course, it would have been better to buy it last year when it was trading at $200, but even at $1,045 per share there is still upside. However, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion now, the upside is unlikely to be as pronounced as when it was much smaller.\n\nFortunately for investors, there are additional stocks to get involved in for exposure to the AI boom, and this new technology will likely lead markets for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "5 Stocks With High ROE to Profit as Markets Sway Whimsically",
        "content": "Over the past couple of trading days, the broader U.S. equity markets swayed wildly, registering the worst day of 2024 to recovering sharply to record-high tallies on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe markets seemed to backtrack as the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s May policy meeting reignited fears that the central bank might not cut interest rates in the near future. The minutes revealed that several Fed officials are of the view that although inflation has eased over the past year, it is yet to achieve the benchmark 2% level. Consequently, there is an increasing willingness to resort to stricter policy measures if inflation fails to move toward the coveted goal.\r\n\r\nHowever, solid quarterly earnings by chipmaker Nvidia and the consequent bullish sentiment on the AI behemoth that boasts a market cap of more than $2.5 trillion led to a spirited turnaround by the markets. With investors betting big on the AI boom on solid demand trends, the markets scripted a remarkable uptrend to wipe off the loss and move into record-high territories.\r\n\r\nThe upward trajectory was also buoyed by the optimism regarding a probable interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the near future. With weaker-than-expected job growth per the April nonfarm payrolls report and moderating wage gains, investors are pricing in a second rate cut by the end of the year with a nearly 50% likelihood of a 25-basis point rate cut in September.\r\n\r\nRecent data from S&P Global further revealed that U.S. Manufacturing PMI rose from 50.0 in April to 50.9 in May, portraying modest improvement in overall business conditions within the goods-producing sector. The headline S&P Global Flash U.S. PMI Composite Output Index rose sharply from 51.3 in April to 54.4 in May, implying healthy growth midway through the second quarter after a slowdown in March and April. \r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Reliance, Inc. RS, Suzano S.A. SUZ, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Banco de Chile BCH are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nWhy ROE?\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nParameters Used for Screening\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.\r\n\r\nReturn on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.\r\n\r\n5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nReliance: Los Angeles, CA-based Reliance is a leading metals service center firm engaged in value-added materials management and metals processing services. It also distributes over 100,000 metal products to more than 125,000 customers across a vast spectrum of industries. Reliance is the biggest North American metals service center company based on revenues with more than 300 locations.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 2.3% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average. It has a VGM Score of B. Reliance carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nSuzano: Headquartered in Salvador, Brazil, Suzano produces and sells eucalyptus pulp and paper products. With more than 90 years of experience, this vertically integrated firm is one of the largest producers of paper and graphic products in South America. \r\n\r\nThe company offers coated and uncoated printing and writing papers, paperboards, tissue papers and lignin. Suzano sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nPulteGroup: Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding – which accounts for the lion’s share of revenues, and Financial Services. \r\n\r\nPulteGroup has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.6% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.5%, on average. It sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nAlphabet: Headquartered in Mountain View, CA, Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Alphabet has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity and improvements in ad formats.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.3%, on average. Alphabet sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nBanco de Chile: Headquartered in Santiago, Chile, Banco de Chile provides various banking services to customers in the Latin American country. These include deposit accounts, loans, payment-related cards and insurance solutions. The company also offers services such as cash management, treasury, financial advisory, trade finance, leasing, factoring, payment, payroll, collection, mutual fund management, securities brokerage, currency trading, investment management, collection, securitization and capital markets services.\r\n\r\nIt delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.1%, on average. Banco de Chile carries a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "Google, Amazon, Apple lobby group opposes India's EU-like antitrust proposal",
        "content": "By Aditya Kalra and Arpan Chaturvedi\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A U.S. lobby group representing tech giants Google, Amazon and Apple has asked India to rethink its proposed EU-like competition law, arguing regulations against data use and preferential treatment of partners could raise user costs, a letter shows.\n\nCiting increasing market power of a few big digital companies in India, a government panel in February proposed imposing obligations on them under a new antitrust law which will complement existing regulations whose enforcement the panel said is \"time-consuming\".\n\nIndia's \"Digital Competition Bill\" is on the lines of EU's landmark Digital Markets Act 2022. It will apply to big firms, including those with a global turnover of over $30 billion and whose digital services have at least 10 million users locally, bringing some of the world's biggest tech firms under its ambit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt proposes to prohibit companies from exploiting non-public data of its users and promoting their own services over rivals, and also abolish restrictions on downloading of third-party apps.\n\nCompanies deploy these strategies to launch new product features and boost security for users, and curbing them will hit their plans, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a May 15 letter to India's Corporate Affairs Ministry, which is working on the law.\n\nThe draft Indian law is \"much further in scope\" than the EU's, says the letter, which has not been made public but was seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Targeted companies are likely to reduce investment in India, pass on increased prices for digital services, and reduce the range of services,\" it says.\n\nThe USIBC, which has asked India to reconsider the planned law, did not respond to Reuters queries, and neither did the Corporate Affairs Ministry, Apple, Amazon or Google.\n\nWith a population of 1.4 billion people and a growing affluent class, India is a lucrative market for big tech companies. Apple CEO Tim Cook said this month the company posted a \"revenue record\" in India during the March quarter, when its overall global revenue declined 4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Indian panel says the new law is needed as a few large digital enterprises \"wield immense control over the market\". As in the EU, it is recommending a penalty of up to 10% of a company's annual global turnover for violations.\n\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) has for years been investigating big tech firms.\n\nThe CCI in 2022 fined Google $161 million, ordering it to stop restricting users from removing its pre-installed apps and allow downloads without using its app store. Google denies wrongdoing and says such restrictions boost user security.\n\nAmazon is also facing an antitrust investigation for favouring select sellers on its India website, an allegation it denies. Apple, too, denies allegations but faces an investigation for alleged abuse of its dominant position in the apps market.\n\nA group of 40 Indian startups, though, has come out in support of the new Indian law, saying it can help address monopolistic practices of dominant digital platforms and create a level playing field for smaller companies.\n\nThere is no fixed timeline, but the Indian government will next review feedback on the proposal before seeking parliament approval with or without changes.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Arpan Chaturvedi; Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Kim Coghill)",

        "content": "Warren Buffett turned Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through a litany of shrewd investments. In fact, its stock price has skyrocketed more than 4,300,000% since he took control in 1965. That accomplishment has made Buffett one of the most revered figures in the financial world.\n\nSurprisingly, Buffett has never recommended Berkshire stock. Instead, he has regularly advised investors to periodically purchase shares of an index fund that tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). That strategy provides diversified exposure to hundreds of American businesses that are collectively \"bound to do well\" over time, according to Buffett.\n\nIndeed, history says investors can build an $903,800 portfolio over three decades by simply investing $350 per month in an S&P 500 index fund. Here's how.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides diversified exposure to hundreds of U.S. companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) measures the performance of 500 U.S. companies, a blend of value stocks and growth stocks from every market sector. The index fund covers about 80% of U.S. equities and nearly 50% of global equities by market capitalization, meaning it spreads money across many of the most influential companies in the world.\n\nOne tailwind that should send the S&P 500 higher in future years is artificial intelligence (AI). Just as e-commerce, mobile connectivity, and cloud computing drove the index higher in past years, many experts see AI as the next generation-defining investment theme. Indeed, the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (shown in the chart) are all well positioned to monetize AI in the future. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to hundreds of stocks that could benefit from artificial intelligence, including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nHere's a look at each company.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is the largest enterprise software vendor and the second-largest cloud computing provider. The company is monetizing artificial intelligence with generative AI Copilots for its software products, and cloud AI services. Most notably, Microsoft Azure lets developers build generative AI applications with large language models from ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has cultivated brand authority across several consumer electronics verticals, and it has a particularly strong market presence in smartphones. The company undoubtedly lags its big tech peers in monetizing artificial intelligence, but upcoming versions of iOS will reportedly feature AI-powered search, summaries, photo editing, and other automations.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) offer unparalleled performance when accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence applications. The company holds more than 80% market share in AI chips, and its extensive product ecosystem -- spanning hardware, software, and services -- makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for building entire AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the market leader in digital advertising and the third-largest cloud computing provider, and it's leaning into artificial intelligence across both product categories with its Gemini model. Specifically, Gemini simplifies ad campaign creation with natural language, supports the development of generative AI applications, and automates work in its office productivity suite Google Workspace.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) enjoys a leadership position in e-commerce, retail advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is using artificial intelligence across all three product categories. Rufus is an AI-powered shopping assistant, Amazon Ads offers generative AI for creating brand images, and Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service for developing generative AI applications.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 is a cheap, easy way to build wealth\n\nThe S&P 500 is a proven moneymaker. The index outperformed virtually every other asset class over the last two decades, from international equities and fixed income to real estate and precious metals, and it has been a profitable investment over every 20-year period in history.\n\nThe S&P 500 returned 1,970% over the last 30 years, compounding at 10.62% annually. At that pace, $350 invested monthly would be worth $74,200 in one decade, $288,100 in two decades, and $903,800 in three decades. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but even a more conservative growth rate of 10% annually would turn $350 invested monthly into $791,000 over three decades.\n\nWarren Buffett believes \"American business -- and consequently a basket of stocks -- is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.\" His logic is simple: The U.S. is the largest and arguably the most innovative economy in the world. Indeed, 16 of the 20 largest companies in the world are U.S. companies, and the U.S. stock market is by far the largest.\n\nThat makes a compelling argument for investing in U.S. stocks, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is essentially a basket of the most successful U.S. companies. Additionally, with an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning the annual fees will total $3 for every $10,000 invested, the index fund is a cheap and easy way to build wealth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Stock to Buy Before It Breaks New Ground in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Next Month",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the biggest driving forces behind the current bull market.\n\nIn the 18 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 33%. The AI trend has been fueled by announcements from Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and practically every other major tech company in the world. There's no doubt AI development has advanced considerably in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nOne company has been relatively quiet when it comes to what it's working on, but management promised to \"break new ground\" in generative AI this year. And those groundbreaking announcements could come in just a few weeks.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is set to take the wraps off its AI development and partnerships at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which starts June 10. Here's what investors can expect and what it means for the stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's AI ambitions are different from the rest of big tech\n\nCentral to Apple's brand is a focus on data privacy and security. As such, it'll highlight the fact that most of its AI features will work on your personal devices.\n\nApple has built its own large language model capable of features like summarizing missed notifications, providing a synopsis of a news article, or transcribing voice memos, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. It'll also improve upon existing features like auto-populating your calendar, suggesting apps, and editing photos.\n\nNone of these features are particularly groundbreaking in and of themselves. But the promise of more on-device AI capabilities down the road as Apple improves its LLM could be the bigger story. As AI features play an increasingly larger role in our digital lives, the ability to keep data private and secure with on-device processing may be the next big step forward in AI, with Apple leading the charge.\n\nIn the meantime, though, Apple knows there's huge demand for AI features it can't necessarily deliver with its current on-device capabilities. As such, it's struck a partnership deal with OpenAI to integrate some of its technology into the next iteration of iOS. It's also held talks with Google to use its Gemini model, but they have yet to come to an agreement.\n\nApple's secret weapon as it races to catch up in AI\n\nOne of the biggest limiting factors in developing AI technology is the need for compute power. Nvidia has a stranglehold on the high-end GPU market, and it can't make chips fast enough to keep up with demand. While that's been great for Nvidia's bottom line, it makes it extremely costly for big tech companies building out data centers full of Nvidia GPU clusters.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost every big tech company that's currently using Nvidia chips for their AI data centers is developing their own chips for training large language models, including Microsoft and Alphabet. But developing cutting-edge chips is hard, and getting them manufactured takes a long time.\n\nApple is using its own chips in its AI data centers, which saves it money and reduces the potential for bottlenecks other big tech companies may experience as they procure Nvidia chips and print their own. Apple is currently using the M2 Ultra chips found in the Mac Pro computer for its data centers. Next year, it could switch to the M4 chips found in the latest version of the iPad Pro released earlier this month. Its existing manufacturing relationships mean it can be very fast and cost effective in building out data centers as it ramps up its AI efforts.\n\nThe fact that it's using the same chips to train its LLM as it uses in its devices is also promising for the future of on-device AI capabilities for Apple's products.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nIt's unlikely Apple will monetize many of its new AI features directly. Instead, the new capabilities may push a large portion of Apple's 2.2 billion user base to upgrade their devices. On-device AI capabilities may only be available on the latest hardware and may encourage more device storage for all those AI-edited photos and videos.\n\nThe majority of iPhones in use in the United States are more than two years old, with about one-third of users holding their phones for three years or longer. These devices are ripe for an upgrade, especially if Apple gives iPhone owners a bit of a push. That could lead to a surge in sales for fiscal 2025, which starts in October. New iPhone models typically come out in September.\n\nMeanwhile, advanced AI capabilities built into the iPhone could open the door for developers to build new AI-powered apps. Apple could capitalize by building what analyst Dan Ives is calling an \"AI App Store.\" AI-enabled features, such as circle-to-search found on Google's Pixel phones, could drive more traffic to search engines. And Apple could see a nice boost to its services revenue if it does. Court documents revealed Apple receives a 36% cut of all of Google's search revenue on iPhones, Macs, and iPads.\n\nAI could fuel sales in the two biggest segments of Apple's business in fiscal 2025. The announcements next month could be just the start.\n\nWhile shares are approaching their all-time high again, the stock still looks attractive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio approaching 30 may curb its appeal for some, but a premium price is justified due to its massive share repurchase program, its existing net cash position, and the long-term outlook for another period of strong earnings growth next year and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Hedge Funds Just Picked Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) As The Top Quantum Computing Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) stand against the other quantum computing stocks.\n\nThese days, artificial intelligence is one of the hottest topics on the stock market and the media. This is because of the improvements in data analysis and decision making offered by AI models. These have augmented pre AI data analysis and text production technologies, and consequently, Wall Street has piled billions of dollars into the industry.\n\nAs AI is to data science, quantum computing is to classical computing. Or at least in some aspects. The fundamental difference between a classical and quantum computer is physics. Classical computers operate under the principles of classic physics, which means that it is easy to determine whether a semiconductor's processor is in the on (1) or off (0) state. In quantum computing's case, a transistor's equivalent is an elemental particle capable of existing in multiple states. So, a quantum 'transistor' could be on and off at the same time, to provide programmers with more flexibility to solve problems.\n\nThis ability to process more inputs means that quantum computing offers complex problems that traditional computers might not have enough capacity for. This is one reason that some estimates expect the quantum computing industry to be worth a modest $11.4 billion by 2027 despite a rapid compounded annual growth rate of 33%.\n\nAt the same time, quantum computing stocks are riskier than even traditional and typically high growth companies. This is because their products do not have sizeable markets and require considerable investment and research and development expenditure which might even take longer to recover than for biotechnology stocks.\n\nThese facts also make it trickier to analyze quantum computing stock performance since there are considerably fewer publicly traded companies to offer the convenience of simply seeing how an exchange traded fund has performed. For instance, consider the holdings of the Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM). Some of its top holdings include software firm MicroStrategy and the memory manufacturer Micron. Neither of these companies generates material income from making products that are essential for a quantum computer to perform. Another major holding is NVIDIA, and while it does make a product for a quantum processing unit's (QPU) quantum controller, most, if not all of its share price gains have been due to artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis means that we need to analyze individual quantum computing stocks to see how they have performed recently. Heading into the year's second half, investors have battled with high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, turmoil in banking, and euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence since 2022.\n\nSome quantum computing stocks that are commonly known are Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI),  IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS). Over the past five years, their shares have lost 89%, 24%, and 89%, respectively. Mind you though, this doesn't mean that quantum computing stocks never go up. For instance, take the example of IonQ. The firm listed its shares for trading in October after a merger, and between October 8th and November 19th, the stock soared by a whopping 233%. For comparison, Wall Street's AI darling NVIDIA's shares have gained 239% over the past twelve months.\n\nSo, the next question to ask is, what happened to this quantum computing stock? Well, part of the reason is a Goldman Sachs investment note that was released in November 2022. The note wondered when businesses would start adopting quantum computing into their operations, and whether the company's technology roadmap could align with this shift, as uncertainty persisted over \"which forms of quantum computer ultimately captures market share,\" according to analyst Toshiya Hari. After losing 14% in the wake of Hari's comments, the stock would proceed to bottom out over the new year in January, but its performance graph changes when we zoom into 2024's performance. April 2024 seems to have been the month for IonQ's shares as the stock is up by 17% since the 19th. Google Inc (GOOG)\n\nLarry Page Our Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best quantum computing stocks, we first made a list of pure play quantum computing companies and those that make crucial products for the industry.  These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n1. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 222\n\nMega cap tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another key player in the global quantum computing market. Like IBM and Intel, it also designs its own quantum computing chips. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also seems to be interested in the practical side of quantum computing as it announced a $5 million prize in March 2024 for those who could think of the best use cases for the technology.\n\nAfter compiling hedge fund regulatory filings for Q1 2024, Insider Monkey found Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake which was worth $6.9 billion.\n\nAs a result, GOOGL ranks first among the 12 best quantum computing stocks to buy now.

        "title": "Could Alphabet Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Online services giant Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has made plenty of millionaires over the years. You'd have more than a million dollars in the Google parent's stock today if you invested just $15,000 when it entered the public stock market in 2004. If you put the same cash to work in a broad market tracker like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) instead, you'd have a total return of just $105,000: GOOGL Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe secret sauce in million-dollar portfolios: Time and patience\n\nBut you can build a million-dollar portfolio without market-crushing stars. Take the index tracker's compound average returns of 10.3% over that 20-year period, commit to making a modest investment every month, and let it run for a few more years.\n\nFor example, imagine setting up an automatic investment of $100 per month at the age of 20. There's no seed money to start that portfolio, no contribution increases over time, and you're sticking with that S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index tracker, automatically reinvesting its dividends in more shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) along the way.\n\n$100 a month isn't nothing, but the commitment is arguably small enough to work for most people with a day job. 44 years later, at the reasonable retirement age of 64, you will have invested a grand total of $52,800 in a simple index ETF. And thanks to the magic of compound returns, you'd have about $1.07 million in your retirement account.\n\nThe bigger they are, the harder they fall\n\nMany diversified mutual funds or ETFs can handle a long-term investment like the example above. Set it, forget it, and laugh all the way to the bank after a few decades.\n\nBut very few single stocks can carry that load. Oceans rise, empires fall, and even the most robust giants aren't immune to unexpected downturns, shifting consumer tastes, and technological progress. Let's check out a couple of examples.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, General Electric(NYSE: GE) boasted the second-largest market cap of all at $508 billion. By now, the industrial empire has split into three separate companies whose market caps add up to about half of the January 2000 footprint. Enron or Lehman Brothers are more dramatic examples of crumbling empires, and the list is long. Among the 1,925 stocks in the Russell 2000 index, only 640 have a stock market history of at least 25 years. Once, I bought a couch with a lifetime warranty from what had once been the largest department store of all. Six months and a bad holiday season later, Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and liquidated the whole business. the company couldn't handle the one-two punch of big-box retailers and the early years of online shopping. So much for lifetime warranties.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Alphabet is built to last\n\nIn light of these examples, it's clear that very few companies can be expected to thrive over several decades. However, there are exceptions to the rule -- and I believe Alphabet is one of those rare survivors.\n\nBuilt to thrive in a variety of economic environments thanks to the ultra-flexible Alphabet umbrella organization, Alphabet has the ability to expand and explore in many different industries. If the online search and advertising revenues dry up, Alphabet would rely on the Android smartphone, YouTube video platform, and Google Cloud decentralized computing service in the short term. Meanwhile, promising side gigs like the Waymo self-driving taxi service, Calico medical research group, or Verily health data unit could pick up the long-term baton. Or maybe Google Cloud will just run with it instead, powered by its artificial intelligence expertise.\n\nAlphabet's portfolio of potential business stars will change over time, and I probably haven't even seen their best ideas yet. And that's exactly why I think the company is ready to run for decades to come. I don't recommend putting your entire nest egg in one basket, unless that basket holds a diversified fund -- but if you absolutely have to do it, Alphabet's stock is at the top of my candidates list.\n\nA flexible business model and proven success in building strong technology solutions position Alphabet to match or even exceed the S&P 500's long-term returns. And if the stock can indeed outperform the average S&P 500 returns in the long run, you'll reach your million-dollar retirement goal even faster.\n\nAnd a small boost to the return rate would make a big difference in 44 years -- beating the Street's average returns by a single percentage point gives you a $1.5 million portfolio in the end: Exported from Investor.gov, a service of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why We Like The Returns At Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)",
        "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Alphabet is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.29 = US$97b ÷ (US$407b - US$77b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nSo, Alphabet has an ROCE of 29%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Alphabet .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Alphabet's ROCE Trend?\n\nAlphabet is displaying some positive trends. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 29%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 57%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nOur Take On Alphabet's ROCE\n\nTo sum it up, Alphabet has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 237% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for GOOGL  that compares the share price and estimated value.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our freelist of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on our list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\n\nClick to see 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.\n\nDavid Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.\n\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\n“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper Q1'2024 Stake Value: $315,939,500\n\nDavid Tepper first bought a stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the third quarter of 2024, gradually adding to his position over the years. However, the billionaire started decreasing his hold in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) significantly in 2021. In the first quarter, Appaloosa decreased its position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 10%. The fund still owns a $316 million stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nStory continues\n\nBloomberg recently reported Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms are in talks with major Hollywood studios to license content for use in AI video generation software.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also one of the most popular AI stocks among the over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, Insider Monkey's proprietary database of hedge funds shows that 222 hedge funds reported owning stakes in the search engine giant, up from 214 funds in the previous quarter.\n\nBronte Capital Amalthea Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our biggest position is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the holding company for Google. It is currently about 12 percent of funds under management. This has been a large position for over ten years.\n\nWe bought a large position in Google in October 20104, and the stock immediately dropped 11 percent.\n\nThat was an astonishingly good purchase and if we had held it all from October 2010 until the end of this month the gain would have been about 1300 percent.\n\nAlas we did not hold it all. We have trimmed it many times – and it is now merely a large position. (We have lived to regret every single trim…)..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "title": "It's more complicated than ever to watch sports — here's why",
        "content": "Let's say you want to watch the entire upcoming NFL season. You'll need to subscribe to quite a few platforms to even come close.\n\nFor starters, you'll need access to traditional pay-TV channels like Fox (FOXA), CBS (PARA), NBC (CMCSA), and ESPN (DIS). You'll also need to subscribe to over-the-top streaming services including Netflix (NFLX), NBCUniversal's Peacock, Disney's ESPN+, and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN).\n\nAnd if you want to watch games not airing in your local area? Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide.\n\nThe NFL season is just one example of how fragmented the sports landscape has become as legacy media players and more recently tech giants compete for pricey media rights deals. The reason: Sports content is highly desired by media companies looking to gain access to massive audiences of loyal viewers. That allows sports leagues to bid up the price of rights in negotiations.\n\n\"The sports leagues are just taking advantage and trying to get as much as they can,\" Jon Christian, head of digital media supply chain at media consulting company Qvest, told Yahoo Finance. \"They do not want to do just an exclusive deal with one partner. They want to have the diversification.\"\n\nThe MLB has national television contracts with broadcasters including ESPN, Fox, and TBS (WBD). Connected TV platform Roku (ROKU) recently acquired the rights to \"Sunday Leadoff,\" which broadcasts MLB games primarily held on Sunday afternoons.\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA is in deep negotiations for its next media rights package that could fetch up to $75 billion.\n\nThe league's current contract with Warner Bros.' TNT Network and Disney's ESPN expires at the end of next season, although rumors have swirled WBD could lose the media rights to NBCUniversal. Amazon is also in talks for an exclusive streaming deal through Prime Video.\n\nEven college sports have seen increased fragmentation. Just this past week, Warner Bros. secured a handful of College Football Playoff games in a five-year deal with ESPN.\n\n'War of eyeballs' Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) puts up a shot against Indiana Pacers guard T.J. McConnell (9) in overtime of Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe competitive land grab for sports is not all that different from years past. What's changed is the players.\n\nVarious networks within the cable bundle frequently fought over the rights to air certain games, as it helped boost viewership as well as affiliate fees, or fees pay-TV providers give network owners to carry their channels.\n\nThe introduction of streaming massively altered the playing field. Not to mention the deep pockets of Big Tech.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What we have now is still that old model plus this new model, so the fragmentation looks much more severe,\" Christian said, describing the current media landscape as a \"war of eyeballs.\" Additionally, \"there is a lot more revenue to be had in terms of rights because you can separate rights between traditional linear broadcast versus digital and get even more money in that way.\"\n\nTo that point, the industry has seen more à la carte deals with streamers amid the leagues' push for diversification.\n\nNetflix, for instance, will host two Christmas Day NFL games this year as part of a three-season deal with the league. The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSimilarly, Peacock will host one exclusive in-season game after it aired an exclusive wild card playoff game this past season. The platform, which paid a reported $110 million for the rights to the playoff game, saw a significant lift in subscribers as a result.\n\nOn the surface, the moves seem like a win-win for both streamers and sports leagues.\n\nBut the experience might not be so great for consumers. The fragmentation means more money, more subscriptions, and more confusion over when, where, and how to watch.\n\nAmid the chaos, certain leagues have approached media rights differently. Major League Soccer, for example, strategically consolidated all of its rights in order to land an exclusive, one-package deal with Apple (AAPL) in 2022.\n\nThere's also been a rise in streaming bundles as media companies look to consolidate costs, reduce churn, and tilt the power away from Big Tech.\n\n\"These platforms are trying to break down the barriers of use [but] it's not necessarily one bill you're paying,\" Christian said. \"This is where users are going to get frustrated. But if you're a fan of a team or sport, you're going to figure out a way to get it.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Most investors who buy tech stocks do so for the potential for high growth and share price appreciation. Considering that the biggest winners over the past decade have been tech stocks, this makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, some investors prefer dividend-paying stocks. In some instances, it might be worth giving up some growth potential for steady, reliable dividend income.\n\nHowever, what might not be as well-known is that many high-growth tech stocks also pay a dividend. These stocks could present the best of both worlds. Investors looking for growth and stock price appreciation can also get some dividend income along the way, improving total returns over time. With this in mind, here are three dividend-paying stocks worth buying right now.\n\nASML\n\nDutch company ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) makes the lithography machines necessary for the manufacture of semiconductors. For the most cutting-edge chips, ASML is the only company in the world that sells these machines. For a company that is integral to a vital product like semiconductors, it's not a surprise that the stock is up 1,170% over the past 10 years, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 241% total return.\n\nCurrently, ASML's dividend yield is 0.71%. That's not impressive sounding at first, but when you look back at the stock's performance over the past 10 years and include dividends, the picture changes. A $1,000 investment in ASML 10 years ago would be worth $11,590 today without dividends and $12,730 with dividends.\n\nManagement is expecting 2024 to be a slow growth year as much of the semiconductor industry is in a down cycle. But ASML has enough orders to fill that it should be able to get through the year with no issues, and it expects to return to growth in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nLong known for its Windows operating system and suite of office software, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has been in the news lately because of its move into artificial intelligence (AI). With its substantial investment in OpenAI, Microsoft has begun integrating generative AI into many of its products.\n\nThe company is also seeing increased cloud revenue for its Azure cloud computing business as other companies need extra computing power for their own AI ambitions.\n\nMuch like ASML, Microsoft has been a market-beating stock over the last 10 years, with a total return of 1,160%. Without dividends, that return would have been 972%. The dividend currently yields 0.69%.\n\nMicrosoft is expecting its cloud infrastructure business Azure to grow by 30% to 31% in the current quarter, driven by AI spending by its customers. This is in line with the recently reported third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\n\nTechnically, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) isn't a dividend stock -- yet. Shareholders as of June 10 will receive Alphabet's first-ever dividend payout on June 17.\n\nThis new dividend program was announced alongside the company's first-quarter earnings in April. The initiation of a dividend isn't a total surprise considering Alphabet generated $16 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter and has more than $110 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet.\n\nTo start, Alphabet's dividend yield won't be much to write home about: approximately 0.5% based on the share price at the time of the first-quarter earnings release. But the company generates lots of cash so it's plausible that the payout could increase over time.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken the stock market by storm since the launch of ChatGPT. And it shouldn't come as a surprise that billionaire hedge fund managers and other investors are among the beneficiaries from the breakthrough technology.\n\nA number of them have made millions betting on stocks like Nvidia, which have soared since the early days of the AI boom. But what are they buying now? With the recent round of 13-F filings in the book, let's take a look at a few of the AI stocks that billionaires are getting greedy with. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has been a popular choice among AI investors since ChatGPT came on the scene. That's because Microsoft is a close partner of OpenAI, the ChatGPT creator, having invested an estimated $13 billion into the start-up. And Microsoft is reaping the benefits, having included OpenAI's technology in a wide range of its products, including Github, its office suite, Bing, and Azure, which has seen significant adoption of Azure OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft stock continued to gain through the first quarter, and is delivering strong results on the top and bottom lines, in part from its AI initiatives.\n\nA number of top investors have taken notice. Among those who bought Microsoft in the first quarter was Stanley Druckenmiller, the longtime manager of Duquesne Capital Management. His Duquesne Family Office fund added 26,150 shares of Microsoft in the quarter, representing its biggest stock holding.\n\nMicrosoft also caught the eye of Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, whose fund added 566,749 shares of Microsoft in the first quarter, roughly doubling its stake in the tech giant.\n\nFinally, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates also loaded up on Microsoft stock in the first quarter, adding 381,793 shares of Microsoft in the quarter, upping his stake to nearly 580,000 shares. Microsoft is still a relatively small holding for Bridgewater, the world's biggest hedge fund, but Dalio seems to like what he sees in the stock.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has emerged as Microsoft's top rival in AI, challenging Microsoft since shortly after the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nAlphabet released its own AI chatbot, Bard, shortly after the launch of ChatGPT, and while its AI strategy hasn't always been well received, the search leader has iterated on it, replacing Bard with Gemini. And it recently began including some AI-based answers to some search queries on Google.\n\nAlphabet was also early to invest in AI, acquiring DeepMind nearly 10 years ago. And though Alphabet was hesitant to release new AI products, the launch of ChatGPT has forced its hand -- and it's a strong one, given its dominance of search.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Google parent's stock has also surged over the last year or so, and, not surprisingly, hedge fund investors are still buying it. First-quarter purchases seem well timed, as the stock just touched an all-time high.\n\nAmong the investors buying Alphabet stock in the first quarter are Chris Hohn's TCI Fund Management, which bought 1.05 million shares of Alphabet. Hohn wrote Alphabet a letter in 2022 urging the company to slim down its cost structure, and many of his wishes have come true, including a round of layoffs in early 2023. Hohn seems to like what he sees from Alphabet, given his aggressive purchasing of the stock.\n\nAnother buyer of Alphabet in the first quarter was Paul Tudor Jones's Tudor Investments, which added 229,696 shares of Alphabet in the first quarter. Alphabet is still a relatively small holding of Tudor's, and Tudor Jones is known for prioritizing preservation of capital.\n\nFinally, Jeremy Grantham's Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company added 1.75 million shares of Alphabet in the first quarter, making it its second-largest holding after Microsoft, and its Alphabet stake is now worth more than $1 billion.\n\nGiven their massive sizes and leading positions in the tech sector, Microsoft and Alphabet are likely to continue to win dollars from the world's top investors and remain among the top AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying Up This Stock Instead",
        "content": "Taking profits in chip giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was a popular move among billionaire hedge fund managers in the first quarter, with a number of notable ones reducing their stakes in the company. Given the run the stock has had, it perhaps should be of little surprise that some big-name investors were taking some profits.\n\nAmong the billionaires reducing their stakes in Nvidia were Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Capital Management, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investments, and Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management.\n\nDruckenmiller talked about his reason for reducing his stake in Nvidia, saying in a CNBC interview that he still liked Nvidia but that artificial intelligence (AI) might be overhyped in the near term. However, he said the big payoff could be big in four to five years and that AI may be underhyped in the long term.\n\nWhile it's common to see billionaire hedge fund managers taking some profits in a stock like Nvidia, several top hedge fund managers are also piling into Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Among the investors aggressively buying the stock in Q1 were Chase Coleman of Tiger Global, Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital, Gavin Baker of Atreides Management, and Foxhaven Asset Management's Michael Pausic and Nick Lawler.\n\nLet's look at why these investors might think Alphabet is an attractive investment.\n\nAlphabet is drawing investor interest\n\nOne of the first things that tends to grab hedge fund managers' attention is valuation. Alphabet trades at a pretty large discount compared to many other AI-related stocks with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 23.6 times. A number of rivals are trading at over 35 times. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIn addition, that is below the multiple where Alphabet has traded historically before the pandemic when it would often trade above a 30 times P/E ratio. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThat gives Alphabet stock room to run higher, but valuation alone is not a reason that well-regarded hedge fund managers would buy the stock.\n\nAn investment in Alphabet is an investment in a company that has two dominant businesses with Google search and video platform YouTube. Google is nearly a monopoly with about an estimated 90% share in global search. While there have been some fears of AI impacting its search business, the company is embracing the technology, rolling out AI overlays at the top of page results to answer more complex questions.\n\nAlphabet will look toward new ad formats to help monetize its latest AI efforts to drive growth. With only about 20% of its search results including ads, this is actually a pretty large opportunity for Google search to become even more profitable in the future by monetizing the search results it doesn't make money from currently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's YouTube platform should also not be overlooked. While many streaming services outside of Netflix have struggled with profitably due to content costs, the revenue-sharing model that Alphabet uses with creators has long alleviated these issues. Meanwhile, the company has a strong opportunity to profit from short-form videos that compete with TikTok, which it has just started to monetize. If its competitor gets banned in the U.S., this could be a big opportunity for the company.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet's cloud computing business is still in the early days of ramping up profitability. Given the high fixed costs of the business, profitability should now grow much faster than revenue, which will be driven by AI adoption. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nShould retail investors follow suit and buy Alphabet?\n\nAlphabet is a relatively inexpensive stock with a dominant position in search and a big opportunity ahead of it with AI. While the stock has had a strong year, up about 27% year to date, it is not too late to follow hedge fund billionaires into the stock.\n\nThe company has a long runway of growth ahead and multiple expansion potential (which is an increase in its valuation multiples, such as P/E). Together that is a powerful combination and makes the stock a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $652,342!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company Is Leading the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution, According to Goldman Sachs (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), most investors and Wall Street analysts use the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks as a key barometer. There are good reasons for this.\n\nMicrosoft has plowed billions of dollars into OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. Moreover, demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) can provide a good idea of where and how businesses are exploring AI-driven use cases.\n\nNevertheless, investment bank Goldman Sachs sees a different member of the Magnificent Seven as the clear-cut winner of the AI revolution so far.\n\nJust days ago, Goldman hailed Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) as the leader among mega-cap AI companies. The reason? Data. Lots and lots of data.\n\nLet's break down why data is Alphabet's competitive advantage, and explore why now is a lucrative time to scoop up shares at a bargain valuation.\n\nAlphabet dominates the internet\n\nThere's no question that ChatGPT has piqued the interest of AI enthusiasts, corporate workplaces, and even students.\n\nOver the past year or so, one knock against Alphabet was that ChatGPT would pose a threat to traditional search habits. Considering that Alphabet is the parent company of internet search engine Google and video-sharing platform YouTube, some became skeptical that the company was facing an existential crisis and losing momentum when it comes to user preferences on the internet.\n\nHowever, even in the face of rising competition, Google and YouTube remain the two most visited websites in the world, each receiving north of 100 billion site visits on a monthly basis. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy is Alphabet's data so important?\n\nThe website traffic that Alphabet generates provides the company with more data points than any other competitor. In turn, Alphabet can use this data as an input to train its large language model (LLM), Gemini.\n\nHedge fund manager and Alphabet investor Bill Ackman cited Alphabet's \"substantial distribution moat\" as a unique feature for the company to sustain its lead in the AI realm.\n\nThis allows Alphabet to develop, hone, and release generative AI applications at a faster pace than alternative platforms. Moreover, the company can integrate its AI-powered tools throughout its large and expanding ecosystem -- advertising, cloud computing, social media, workplace productivity software, and more.\n\nAlphabet stock looks dirt cheap\n\nAccording to the chart below, Alphabet has the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio among its Magnificent Seven peers. GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMy take is that investors are discounting Alphabet's growth prospects, and the reason is largely rooted in competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, ChatGPT is undoubtedly popular, and Microsoft has witnessed some impressive growth since integrating the AI tool throughout its ecosystem. Moreover, semiconductor companies will likely be a long-term beneficiary of the broader AI movement as secular tailwinds continue to push demand for chips.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that Alphabet's business model is in danger. In fact, rising competition and booming use cases in AI could very well lead to a new chapter in Alphabet's growth story.\n\nI think investors are missing the forest for the trees here. Alphabet is extremely well positioned to benefit from several aspects of AI. As people continue to rely on Google and YouTube for sources of information and entertainment, Alphabet will remain as the leader in data collection. This should ultimately serve as the catalyst for the company's long-term AI roadmap.\n\nTo me, Alphabet stock is dirt cheap, and the discount compared to mega-cap peers is a buying opportunity. Investors with a long-term horizon should consider taking advantage of the valuation disparity in Alphabet stock and scoop up some shares right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here Are the 2 Growth Stocks Google's Parent Company Just Added to Its $7 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "When Google restructured its business as Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) it broke out its Other Bets segment from its core Google operations. While many investors are familiar with some of those other bets like Waymo (autonomous vehicles) and Verily (life sciences), the segment also includes a $7 billion investment fund called CapitalG.\n\nCapitalG is a venture capital fund focused on growth-stage companies. Not only does it give these companies a cash infusion in the form of an equity investment, but it also gives them access to Google's expertise. That can be a huge advantage for a young company, and CapitalG has seen 16 of the companies it's invested in make an IPO.\n\nOn top of CapitalG, Alphabet holds investments in 43 publicly traded companies, which accounted for about $2.5 billion worth of its investment holdings as of the end of last quarter, according to filings with the SEC. And there are two beaten down publicly traded growth stocks the fund added to last quarter that may be worth a closer look. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. GitLab\n\nAlphabet gave a substantial boost to its stake in GitLab(NASDAQ: GTLB) last quarter, increasing its total share count by 269%. It's now, by far, Alphabet's biggest public holding, amounting to approximately $550 million in value.\n\nGitLab is code repository management platform similar to Microsoft's GitHub. It integrates numerous software development tools and makes it easy to maintain code, track issues, and maintain security to keep all your company's code private.\n\nGitLab offers individuals its services for free, but charges for premium features or enterprise accounts. It counts more than 30 million users and 1 million active license users.\n\nThe free tier is essential to its land-and-expand strategy, which has been working well. It produced a dollar-based net retention rate of 130% in the fourth quarter, meaning existing customers were spending about 30% more on its services last quarter than the year before. The number of customers spending more than $1 million per year climbed to 96, up 52% year over year. Both helped it grow its top line 33% in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut management disappointed Wall Street with its guidance for fiscal 2025. The company expects revenue between $725 million and $731 million, resulting in EPS of $0.19 to $0.23. Those numbers came in below analysts' expectations and sent the share price down in March.\n\nThe stock valuation is high no matter which way you cut it. That makes the stock risky. But with strong revenue growth, super high gross margins, and demonstrable operating leverage in the business, it could rapidly grow earnings. Analysts covering the stock expect 38% annual growth over the next five years. While it's a somewhat risky investment, you'd have good company in Alphabet if you decide to add it to your portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Prime Medicine\n\nAlphabet is one of the largest outside investors in Prime Medicine(NASDAQ: PRME), and it increased its share count in the company last quarter by 27%. Alphabet's 15 million shares give it a 12.55% stake in the biotech company.\n\nPrime Medicine focuses on gene-editing therapies. It recently received FDA clearance to begin phase 1/2 study of its treatment for chronic granulomatous disease. It has several other treatments in the discovery or lead optimization portion of the development pipeline.\n\nAs such, Prime Medicine is pre-revenue, and investors are heavily focused on its cash burn rate and balance sheet. After offering additional shares of the stock to the public in February, the company ended the quarter with $210.7 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. It holds an additional $13.5 million in restricted cash.\n\nOver the past four quarters, cash burn has totaled about $200.6 million. What's more, that number is getting bigger as it ramps up R&D expenses related to new therapies in its pipeline. Unfortunately, Prime Medicine will in all likelihood burn through its existing cash runway before its chronic granulomatous therapy gets to market. That means, it'll have to raise cash again, likely through issuing new shares considering the current cost of debt.\n\nPrime Medicine could produce some breakthrough treatments with its gene-editing process, but its finances are very precarious. That makes it a very risky investment that could have a lot of upside but just as much downside. Be mindful of your allocation if you choose to follow Alphabet and buy shares around the current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Cats on the moon? Google's AI tool is producing misleading responses that have experts worried",
        "content": "Ask Google if cats have been on the moon and it used to spit out a ranked list of websites so you could discover the answer for yourself.\n\nNow it comes up with an instant answer generated by artificial intelligence — which may or may not be correct.\n\n“Yes, astronauts have met cats on the moon, played with them, and provided care,\" said Google's newly retooled search engine in response to a query by an Associated Press reporter.\n\nIt added: \"For example, Neil Armstrong said, ‘One small step for man’ because it was a cat’s step. Buzz Aldrin also deployed cats on the Apollo 11 mission.”\n\nNone of this is true. Similar errors — some funny, others harmful falsehoods — have been shared on social media since Google this month unleashed AI overviews, a makeover of its search page that frequently puts the summaries on top of search results.\n\nThe new feature has alarmed experts who warn it could perpetuate bias and misinformation and endanger people looking for help in an emergency.\n\nWhen Melanie Mitchell, an AI researcher at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, asked Google how many Muslims have been president of the United States, it responded confidently with a long-debunked conspiracy theory: “The United States has had one Muslim president, Barack Hussein Obama.”\n\nMitchell said the summary backed up the claim by citing a chapter in an academic book, written by historians. But the chapter didn’t make the bogus claim — it was only referring to the false theory.\n\n“Google’s AI system is not smart enough to figure out that this citation is not actually backing up the claim,” Mitchell said in an email to the AP. “Given how untrustworthy it is, I think this AI Overview feature is very irresponsible and should be taken offline.”\n\nGoogle said in a statement Friday that it's taking “swift action” to fix errors — such as the Obama falsehood — that violate its content policies; and using that to “develop broader improvements” that are already rolling out. But in most cases, Google claims the system is working the way it should thanks to extensive testing before its public release.\n\n“The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high-quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,\" Google said a written statement. “Many of the examples we’ve seen have been uncommon queries, and we’ve also seen examples that were doctored or that we couldn’t reproduce.”\n\nIt's hard to reproduce errors made by AI language models — in part because they're inherently random. They work by predicting what words would best answer the questions asked of them based on the data they've been trained on. They're prone to making things up — a widely studied problem known as hallucination.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AP tested Google's AI feature with several questions and shared some of its responses with subject matter experts. Asked what to do about a snake bite, Google gave an answer that was “impressively thorough,” said Robert Espinoza, a biology professor at the California State University, Northridge, who is also president of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.\n\nBut when people go to Google with an emergency question, the chance that an answer the tech company gives them includes a hard-to-notice error is a problem.

Google is asking that a federal judge, rather than a jury, decide whether it violated U.S. antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“The more you are stressed or hurried or in a rush, the more likely you are to just take that first answer that comes out,” said Emily M. Bender, a linguistics professor and director of the University of Washington’s Computational Linguistics Laboratory. “And in some cases, those can be life-critical situations.”\n\nThat’s not Bender’s only concern — and she has warned Google about them for several years. When Google researchers in 2021 published a paper called “Rethinking search” that proposed using AI language models as “domain experts” that could answer questions authoritatively — much like they are doing now — Bender and colleague Chirag Shah responded with a paper laying out why that was a bad idea.\n\nThey warned that such AI systems could perpetuate the racism and sexism found in the huge troves of written data they’ve been trained on.\n\n“The problem with that kind of misinformation is that we’re swimming in it,” Bender said. “And so people are likely to get their biases confirmed. And it’s harder to spot misinformation when it’s confirming your biases.”\n\nAnother concern was a deeper one — that ceding information retrieval to chatbots was degrading the serendipity of human search for knowledge, literacy about what we see online, and the value of connecting in online forums with other people who are going through the same thing.\n\nThose forums and other websites count on Google sending people to them, but Google's new AI overviews threaten to disrupt the flow of money-making internet traffic.\n\nGoogle's rivals have also been closely following the reaction. The search giant has faced pressure for more than a year to deliver more AI features as it competes with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and upstarts such as Perplexity AI, which aspires to take on Google with its own AI question-and-answer app.\n\n“This seems like this was rushed out by Google,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity’s chief business officer. “There’s just a lot of unforced errors in the quality.”\n\n—————-\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock: Cheaper than it Was a Year Ago",
        "content": "Nvidia NVDA reported earnings this week and posted another quarter of stunning growth, beating analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom line and announcing a ten-for-one stock split.\n\nNvidia continues to completely dominate the AI infrastructure industry, providing all the major technology businesses of the world with the GPUs and data center products required to run the extremely demanding models.\n\nThe word “dominating” almost doesn’t capture the influence this company is having on the industry, and its outrageous growth rates are truly something to behold.\n\nQuarterly revenue of $26 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and 262% YoY, while Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was up 23% on the quarter and 427% on the year.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $14.8 billion and is up 628% YoY. To put that growth into perspective, Nvidia’s total annual revenue in 2021 was $16 billion, which is now about how much profit they make in just a quarter!\n\nCan investors still buy Nvidia stock at these elevated levels?\n\nSometimes in the market we see growth stocks with great stories, and huge growth projections go on incredible runs in a short period, only to fall back to earth when the growth doesn’t materialize. That is not what’s happening at Nvidia.\n\nGrowth at Nvidia has already been realized with sales and earnings having already climbed many multiples over just the last year, and with more to come.\n\nAs of right now sales for this year are expected to increase 77.6% to $108 billion, but next year’s sales growth is still fairly tepid, with forecasts of 20.5%. While this year’s estimates are lofty, analysts remain grounded as they look further out.\n\nWith just 20% growth projected for next year, we could even see more upside surprises.\n\nWhen looking at relative valuations, Nvidia is actually cheaper than it was a year ago. At the beginning of 2023, NVDA was trading at a forward earnings multiple of about 90x, while today it is trading at 45.3x FY24 earnings estimates and just 36x FY25 earnings estimates.\n\nI think investors can still safely invest in Nvidia stock based on its reasonable valuation, and future expected growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow is Nvidia Stock Cheaper Today?\n\nWhile yes, Nvidia’s stock has appreciated nearly 4x over the last year, earnings have outpaced that growth! Earnings are up nearly 6x in that time, and margins have expanded from 18.5% to 54.3%.\n\nWith those growth rates, and improved business fundamentals, you could argue that Nvidia deserves and even richer earnings multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Steadily Climbing Earnings Estimates\n\nI don’t know about other research publications, but at Zacks we have been all over Nvidia this last year. In the chart below we can see that earnings estimates began to rise in Q2 2023, and at that time it jumped onto the Zacks Rank.\n\nIt has enjoyed a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating for nearly that entire time, besides for occasional periods of dropping down to a Rank #2, when analysts took breaks from upgrading it.\n\nA number of contributors here have been pounding the table about buying Nvidia stock, and if you look back, I have published a number of bullish writeups over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhich Other Stocks can I buy for AI Exposure?\n\nEven with the reasons shared here, many investors will still resist buying Nvidia stock, and I do understand the psychological difficulties with buying a stock that has rallied so much already. So, for those investors I will share my other top picks to ride the AI wave.\n\nAlphabet GOOGL has quickly jumped near the front of the AI expansion. At its most recent developer conference, Alphabet shared a number of exciting new AI integration to its suite of products.\n\nAI Agents, they call them, will act as an assistant across Gmail, Search, and Android devices.\n\nAlphabet also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, as well as a historically discounted valuation. Trading at 22.8x forward earnings, it is below its 10-year median of 26.2x.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock has been showing considerable relative strength against most of the other mega-cap technology stocks, outperforming all the Magnificent Seven excluding Nvidia in the last three months. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAnother AI beneficiary with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is Arista Networks ANET.\n\nLess well known than most of its AI counterparts, Arista Networks specializes in high-performance, software-driven network switches and routers for data centers, cloud computing, and large-scale enterprise environments.\n\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in the AI boom by providing the advanced networking infrastructure required for AI workloads. Its high-speed, low-latency switches and routers facilitate the efficient data flow and massive computational power needed for AI and machine learning applications.\n\nNot everyone has missed this quiet AI-winner though, as analysts have been steadily raising earning estimates over the last year, and the stock has rallied nearly 100% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn just the last two days I have had a number of people reaching out and asking, “is it too late to buy Nvidia?” And my answer is no, it probably isn’t too late.\n\nOf course, it would have been better to buy it last year when it was trading $200, but even at $1,045 per share there is still upside. However, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion now, the upside is unlikely to be as pronounced as when it was much smaller.\n\nFortunately for investors, there are additional stocks to get involved in for exposure to the AI boom, and this new technology will likely lead markets for the foreseeable future.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Lobbying groups representing airlines, hotels and retailers have urged European Union tech regulators to ensure that Google takes their views into account, and not just large intermediaries, when making changes to comply with landmark tech rules.\n\nAirlines for Europe group that has Air France KLM and British Airways owner IAG> as members, hotel group Hotrec, European Hotel Forum, EuroCommerce, Ecommerce Europe and Independent Retail Europe had in March expressed their concerns about the impact of the new rules.\n\nEU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) imposes a list of dos and don'ts on Google and five other tech giants aimed at giving users more choice and rivals a better chance to compete, but the groups voiced concerns the the adjustments could hurt their revenues.\n\nIn a joint letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton dated May 22 they said their worries have mounted since then.\n\n\"Our industries have serious concerns that currently considered solutions and requirements for implementing the DMA could further increase discrimination,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Initial observations indicate that these changes risk severely depleting direct sales revenues of companies by giving more prominence to powerful online intermediaries due to the preferential treatment they would receive,\" they said.\n\nThe Commission, which is now investigating Google for possible DMA breaches, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle, which in a March blog post said changes to search results give large intermediaries and aggregators more traffic and less for hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants, had no immediate comment.\n\n\"We are concerned that the non-compliance investigation refers only to the need to treat third-party services in a fair and non-discriminatory manner, without any acknowledgement of European businesses that also offer their services on Google,\" the groups said.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction among sports clients on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest five-year agreement between Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and FWD Group Holdings Limited (“FWD”). The agreement is the extension of the latter’s cloud technology collaboration with AWS.\r\n\r\nThis highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.\r\n\r\nPer the agreement, AWS has become the strategic cloud provider of FWD. In order to support its cloud-first strategy, FWD intends to leverage AWS’s cloud computing capabilities, agility and scalability.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of FWD has added strength to AWS’s customer base.\r\n\r\nAWS’s concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike CRWD extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. Notably, CrowdStrike is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases. More precisely, CrowdStrike aims to accelerate the development of generative AI capabilities in its Falcon Platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Brightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media, and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cyber security operations.\r\n\r\nZilch extended its collaboration with AWS to expand the use of the latter’s AI and ML services in order to accelerate sales in the next two years, and improve customer service and lending decisions.\r\nWe believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become the key catalyst of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 20.3% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWe believe that AWS’s growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reports indicate that 17 Waymo vehicles crashed into objects including gates, chains and parked cars. The agency also cited 5 instances in which the automated-driving system appeared to violate traffic rules, such as driving in opposing lanes with nearby oncoming traffic.\n\nRead More: Alphabet’s Waymo Probed by US After Autonomous Car Incidents\n\nNHTSA said in the letter, which is dated May 23 but was posted to the agency’s website on Friday, that some of the new incidents were reported by Waymo under a 2021 standing order that requires carmakers to inform regulators of any accidents involving automated driving systems. The agency said some of the other new incidents were identified by regulators who reviewed publicly available information.\n\nThe defects office said it’s “concerned that ADS-equipped vehicles exhibiting such unexpected driving behaviors may increase the risk of crash, property damage, and injury.”\n\nWaymo didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHighway safety regulators have been subjecting both driver-assistance systems and more advanced autonomous vehicles to greater scrutiny. In addition to the ongoing Waymo investigation, probes have recently been launched into Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot, Ford Motor Co.’s BlueCruise and Amazon.com Inc.’s Zoox.\n\nThe NHTSA also opened an investigation in October of possible defects in the automated-driving system developed by General Motors Co.’s self-driving unit, Cruise, which reached a settlement of more than $8 million after one of its vehicles hit and then dragged a pedestrian.\n\nRead More: Self-Driving Car Investigations Surge After Crashes and Mishaps\n\n--With assistance from Bill Haubert.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn’t TikTok Video Playing on Finance Bro Stereotype Becomes a Viral Hit The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Hold for a Decade of Life-Changing Wealth Creation",
        "content": "Investing is quite certainly a slow-and-steady journey that resembles a marathon; patience and consistency are the keys to success. But let’s face it – we all try to identify which stocks have the potential to create life-changing wealth!\n\nWhile the largest chunk of my portfolio is more securely nestled in ETFs, I also maintain a handful of carefully chosen positions that I plan to hold for a decade or more. This is fueled by the speculation that they may outperform the overall market.\n\nThe following three names feature strong growth and profitability prospects, forming quite compelling investment cases that could power strong wealth creation over the next decade. It’s important to remember, that with singled-out stock, your risk exposure is higher, as there is no guarantee those companies will remain solvent over time. However, with the right picks, this can be avoided.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) has consistently outperformed the market over the years, creating massive amounts of wealth for its shareholders. Yet, it may still be in the early stages of market domination. The company has been on a journey to empower law enforcement agencies with cutting-edge technology and ultimately save more lives.\n\nIt all began with their iconic Taser device, which aims to render bullets obsolete. Since then, the company has grown tremendously, offering a diverse portfolio that includes cutting-edge body cameras and advanced evidence management software. What’s more, all of these offerings seamlessly integrate within its cloud platform, forming a powerful ecosystem for police departments and other agencies.\n\nTo illustrate the company’s ongoing momentum, Axon’s revenues between 2014 and 2024 grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.5%. Even more special is the fact that Axon’s growth has accelerated in recent years. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 63x, AXON stock is obviously trading at a premium multiple. Yet, its rapid penetration into this niche yet exciting industry likely justifies it.\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is one of my largest positions and one I plan to hold for at least a decade from today. The rather funny nature of the company’s iconic clog shoe might make it a bit hard to take Crocs seriously as a potential investment. However, Crocs is so much more than that. The company has shown remarkable adaptability, transcending its initial perception as a novelty footwear brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo elaborate, while its iconic clog remains a staple, Crocs has diversified its offerings to include a wide range of styles catering to various consumer preferences. The HEYDUDE acquisition, which closed in early 2022, significantly expanded its target group. Notably, the company has been rapidly paying down the debt issued to fund this acquisition and can, therefore, resume share repurchases.\n\nThe reason Crocs has grown to be one of my largest positions lately is that its shares seem to be trading at a discounted valuation. Despite Crocs having grown its revenues at a 10-year CAGR of 12.7% while featuring industry-leading margins, the stock is trading at a forward P/E of just 11.3x. Thus, investors should have a notable margin of safety as well.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) is far from a hidden gem. Most investors likely already have some exposure to this tech giant, as it’s one of the largest holdings in major indices. Nevertheless, on an individual level, Alphabet’s potential for significant wealth creation remains outstanding.\n\nCritics have long voiced concerns about the company’s investment case, especially when it comes to the looming impact of AI platforms like ChatGPT on its core search engine business. Yet, Alphabet has consistently delivered robust growth across all fronts lately, effectively debunking such claims. If anything, Alphabet’s own AI developments have been driving strong targeting results for advertisers, leading to significant revenue growth.\n\nIn its most recent results, Google Search revenues rose by 14%, reaching $46.2 billion. Its YouTube Ads revenues saw an even stronger increase of 21%, totaling $8.1 billion. These numbers contradict the prevailing concerns voiced by skeptics. Simultaneously, Alphabet boasts one of the healthiest balance sheets on Wall Street. Its strong growth and underlying fundamentals position the stock for robust wealth creation moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis held long positions in AXON, CROX, and GOOGL/GOOG.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Salesforce",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Salesforce CRM.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Boosts AWS Clientele with NinjaTech AI Deal\n\nAmazon continues to ride on its robust cloud computing arm — Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\"). The solid customer momentum of AWS is driving the company's top line. Shares of Amazon have rallied 20.4% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 index's growth of 12.7%.\n\nThe latest partnership of a generative AI company called NinjaTech AI with AWS is a testament to the above-mentioned fact.\n\nThe former launched the next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using AWS's machine learning (ML) chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\n\nApart from these next-generation chips, NinjaTech AI is leveraging Amazon SageMaker in a bid to make training of the underlined AI agents fast, flexible and affordable.\n\nWith the help of AWS cloud solutions, Ninja is capable of saving time and money by implementing generative AI in everyday workflows.\n\nAWS's Portfolio Strength: A Key Catalyst\n\nNinjaTech AI's latest move highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services. Moreover, it has added strength to AWS's customer base.\n\nBoth Trainium and Inferentia2 chips are designed to support the larger 70B variants of the latest popular open-source models like Llama 3. While Trainium chips help train Large Language Models at low costs by powering high-performance compute clusters on AWS, Inferentia2 chips enable models to generate inferences faster and at much lower costs.\n\nIn addition to these chips, AWS recently introduced Amazon Bedrock innovations in order to bolster generative AI strength. These innovations include the latest custom model import capability and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails, which are designed to deliver easy, fast and secure ways to develop advanced generative AI applications and experiences.\n\nAWS also made its generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q generally available.\n\nAWS's growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings are likely to continue driving customer momentum. This, in turn, will continue to drive AWS's top-line growth in the near term and the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn first-quarter 2024, AWS sales (18% of the total sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion.\n\nStrengthening the AWS segment, in turn, will boost Amazon's overall financial performance.\n\nFor second-quarter 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $148.54 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.5%.\n\nThe same for earnings per share stands at $1.02, which indicates a year-over-year rise of 61.9%.\n\nRising Competition\n\nAmazon's solidifying prospects in the promising cloud computing market are expected to continue providing a competitive advantage over its peers like Microsoft and Alphabet's Google, which are also gaining steam.\n\nMicrosoft is continuously riding on strong momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business, driven by the solid adoption of Azure. Strength in Azure AI remains a positive. The company's strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI are noteworthy. Also, growth in AI Copilot is contributing well to Microsoft's cloud business.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud, which has turned out to be the key catalyst for Alphabet's growth, is gaining from the growing generative AI capabilities, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace remains a major positive.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Salesforce, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nShares of Salesforce have gained 8.3% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for CRM is 17.45%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

They are cautious about licensing content without control over its use.\n\nRecently, Scarlett Johansson demanded that OpenAI stop using a voice resembling hers for its chatbot.\n\nOn Wednesday, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) (NASDAQ:NWSA) agreed to let OpenAI use content from its publications in a deal potentially worth over $250 million over five years. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) is open to licensing specific programs but not its entire library.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) are interested in other collaborations but not licensing their content.\n\nNew AI tools, like OpenAI’s Sora and Alphabet’s Veo, promise to help filmmakers create vivid clips from text descriptions, causing excitement and anxiety in the industry.\n\nPreviously, the U.S. Big Tech companies and news publishers were at loggerheads over AI’s influence, particularly regarding the unauthorized use of the latter’s content for AI training.\n\nGoogle’s AI search bred concerns for publishers over losing a substantial portion of their Google-generated traffic.\n\nReports indicated Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet committed over $32 billion in AI infrastructure in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nPrice Actions: At the last check Friday, GOOGL shares traded higher by 0.52% at $174.45 premarket.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +10.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 7.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +11.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32.8%. This estimate has changed +13.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.74 indicates a change of +13.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +12.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $291.26 billion and $325.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.6% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Dan Loeb Just Loaded Up on These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "One of the best ways to get a glimpse into the minds of prominent investors is to look at their 13F filings. These forms are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and break down the buying and selling activity of large institutional money managers.\n\nRecently, I parsed through the 13F of Third Point, a hedge fund started by billionaire investor Dan Loeb. Given the moves he is making, I would say that Loeb is bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). While this shouldn't come as a surprise, I was intrigued by the particular companies he's buying.\n\nThe AI narrative has been dominated by Microsoft and Nvidia so far. Nevertheless, Loeb made some splashy buys in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" recently buying 900,000 shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and 3 million shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nI like these moves a lot. Let's break down how Amazon and Alphabet are quietly emerging as leaders in the AI realm, and explore why each stock is a lucrative buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon: The cash-flow machine\n\nAmazon is primarily known for its e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nBut over the years, the company has quietly expanded into other growth areas including streaming, advertising, grocery delivery, and more. Building such a diversified business has provided Amazon with a unique opportunity.\n\nThe thesis is that Amazon can integrate AI-powered services across its ecosystem, thereby reaching consumers on a broader level and cross-selling more products to them.\n\nOne of the most important moves Amazon made in the last year was a $4 billion investment in an AI start-up called Anthropic. The main idea was to use Anthropic to accelerate growth in AWS. It uses AWS as its primary cloud provider and is training its generative AI models on Amazon's infrastructure.\n\nThis is important because Anthropic is ultimately serving as a source of lead generation for AWS, helping propel deals for new products including Amazon Bedrock.\n\nAnother move is Amazon's investments in data centers. The company recently committed $11 billion to build new data centers in Indiana. This decision came at a crucial time.\n\nAt the moment, Nvidia dominates the market for AI semiconductors. But Amazon is developing its own line of chips, Trainium and Inferentia. Building its own data centers should help it become more independent with chips in the long run. It also provides Amazon with a path to keep the majority of its AI ambitions internal, relying less on third-party providers.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEven though the AI revolution is very much in its infancy, over the last 12 months Amazon has generated $50 billion of free cash flow as the company witnesses new growth across its entire business.\n\nI think AWS in particular has a bright future. Furthermore, as AI becomes more engrained across Amazon's entire business, the investments it is making today are extremely savvy, and I am bullish on the long-term payoff.\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 3.3, nearly identical to its 10-year average. I think a lot of investors are discounting Amazon's position in the AI landscape and are underappreciating the potential upside the company could see in the long run. To me, the stock is a bargain, and I am aligned with Loeb's decision to scoop up shares.\n\n2. Alphabet: A rising star in the cloud\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google and YouTube. With the broad reach each of these has on the internet, it's not surprising that Alphabet's largest source of revenue is advertising.\n\nWhile the company is certainly a leader in online advertising, Alphabet does face some stiff competition from the likes of Meta Platforms and TikTok. And the advertising industry is cyclical and can be unreliable.\n\nOne way that Alphabet is responding is through its competitive advantage: data. It owns one of the biggest libraries of consumer search trends, a huge asset that it can use to train its large language model, called Gemini.\n\nThe pace at which Gemini can be trained is also important. As Google and YouTube remain dominant forces online, Alphabet is strongly positioned to store, analyze, and process myriad data sets to hone Gemini and create more products and services.\n\nOne area where Alphabet is already demonstrating some impressive growth is in cloud computing. Google Cloud Platform is Alphabet's fastest growing business and is already generating operating profits.\n\nAs with Amazon, I wouldn't sleep on Alphabet's potential to become a strong force in AI. The company is building a full-spectrum AI business, spanning workplace productivity tools, cloud computing, e-commerce, consumer search, and more.\n\nAt a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.3, the stock trades at a discount to each of its Magnificent Seven peers except Meta. To me, Alphabet shares look dirt cheap, and I think long-term investors will enjoy market-beating returns as AI continues to play a big role in the company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement",
        "content": "Alongside its latest earnings results, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10:1 stock split and a 150% dividend raise following the market closed on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia shares, now the ninth most expensive in the S&P 500, opened above $1,000 a day after the print. A 10:1 split would imply a $100/share price, all else being equal, after trading opens on Monday, June 10th.\n\nThis year, eight companies announced stock splits, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in January and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) in March. The surge in Big Tech share prices prompted four splits among the ‘Magnificent 7’ mega-cap stocks since 2022, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making shares more accessible. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) split in 2020, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are nearing the $500/share threshold.\n\n“S&P 500 stocks with share prices over $500 represent $7.4tn in market cap, or about 16% of the index,” Bank of America analysts said in a Thursday note.\n\nIn their recently updated research, BofA found that stock splits are typically bullish for companies that enact them. On average, returns one year post-split are 25%, compared to around 12% for the broader market.\n\n“Splits seem to be bullish across market regimes, something management teams might consider if shares look too expensive for buybacks,” analysts wrote.\n\nWhen comparing the distribution of stock split returns relative to the S&P 500, it can be seen that a few strong companies often improve average performance. For instance, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) gained 56% in the 12 months following its October 2022 split announcement, while Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) rose 39% after declaring its split in August 2022, BofA highlighted.\n\nGiven that gains are more common and typically larger than losses, stock splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets. For example, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Valero experienced strong performance after their split announcements, regardless of their prior trading behavior.\n\nHowever, outperformance is not guaranteed, BofA’s team cautions. Roughly 30% of stocks see negative returns 12 months post-split, with an average decline of 22%. While splits may indicate strong momentum, companies can still struggle in a challenging macro environment.\n\n“Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked. Amazon is a good example of how stocks can recover, however, and was up 26% in the 24 months after its split announcement,” the firm noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent NVDA shareholders will receive 10 shares for every share they own today, while the market capitalization of the AI giant will remain unchanged.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement\n\nExclusive-KKR set for unconditional EU antitrust okay for Telecom Italia deal, sources say\n\nWorkday shares dive 12% on lowered subscription revenue outlook\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon readies Alexa for its second act—but it has an uphill battle",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\n\nBefore ChatGPT could talk, there was Alexa. The decade-old Amazon voice assistant, however, never fully delivered on its potential and was useful for little more than setting a kitchen timer or telling you the weather.\n\nBut now with the full force of generative AI at its disposal, Amazon is looking toward Alexa’s second act. Sometime this year, the company plans to launch an overhauled, “more conversational” version of Alexa, sources told CNBC. Along with new and improved generative AI-powered capabilities, Amazon also plans to introduce a new business model for Alexa. Rather than be included with the company’s Prime subscription, Alexa will require its own monthly subscription.\n\nWhile Alexa has previously dominated voice assistant competitors, including Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant, the recent steady release of powerful generative AI-powered chatbots has made clear this space is newly up for grabs. Amazon has already sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, according to Amazon, which could give the company a leg up.\n\nAt the same time, Amazon hasn’t exactly shown itself to be an AI disrupter—the company is certainly supporting the AI boom via Amazon Web Services and has hitched its wagon to AI startup Anthropic by investing billions of dollars in it, but it hasn’t released any leading AI models that would put it in the same realm as OpenAI, Google, or Meta.\n\nA generative AI-powered Alexa could be Amazon’s opportunity to finally get in on the AI boom, not to mention finally deliver on the true vision of Alexa. But it faces real challenges: its own lagging position in AI, technical hurdles and runaway compute costs still plaguing the industry, and fierce competition from other tech giants that are all vying to deliver the best AI assistant experience.\n\nDespite the recent controversy around the Scarlett Johansson-esque voice for ChatGPT, OpenAI put a stake in the ground with its demo of the latest version of its product last week. Google has also rolled out voice support for its Gemini model. And next month at its annual developers conference, Apple is expected to unveil a new generative AI-powered, more conversational Siri. Apple faces many of the same challenges as Amazon in terms of its AI position, but the company is reportedly negotiating with Google to bring its leading Gemini model to the iPhone.\n\n“A lot of us have had this vision for what a powerful assistant can be, but we were held back by the underlying technology not being able to serve that goal,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the Decoder podcast this week. “I think we have a technology that is better able to serve that. That’s why you’re seeing the progress again. I think that’s exciting.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf these products succeed, they could completely change how we interact with technology, get information, organize our lives, and use products and services. The New York Times reported that Apple executives worry new AI technology could displace its iPhone’s iOS software and threaten its dominance over the smartphone market. With an ecosystem of AI agents, we may no longer need apps or the app store.\n\nThat’s the exact future wearable maker Humane was betting on with its Ai Pin, though it’s clear we’re still quite a ways off. The Ai Pin was designed to speak out loud to people wearing it and handle many of the same tasks as Alexa and Siri, but it failed to deliver. Gadget reviewer Marques Brownlee dubbed it “the worst product I’ve ever reviewed…for now”, and yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Humane is seeking to be acquired after the product’s rocky launch.\n\nThe dream of finally delivering a true AI assistant feels closer than ever before, and at the same time, still very far away. In OpenAI’s demo last week, Sky very much sounded like a real person—both in terms of its voice and how it answered questions (and as always, it’s important to remember that we can only trust a demo so much). But sounding like a real person is only half the battle. These models are still limited by the fact that they’re confidently wrong all the time. As I continue to test ChatGPT, I am floored by how consistently wrong it is. I feel like I can’t trust a word it says.\n\n“I wonder if the intelligence is increasing at the same rate as the facility with language,” Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, said to Pichai during the Decoder conversation. “I kind of don’t see it, to be perfectly honest. I see computers getting much better at language and actually in some cases getting dumber.”\n\nAnd with that, here’s more AI news.\n\nSage Lazzaro\r\nsage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\r\nsagelazzaro.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Judge weighs proposed changes to Google's Android app store to prevent anticompetitive tactics",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google is tried to confront the latest in a succession of legal attacks on its digital empire on Thursday as federal judge began to address anticompetitive practices in the app market for smartphones powered by its Android software.\n\nThe San Francisco court hearing before U.S. District Judge James Donato comes five months after a nine-person jury decided Google had turned its Play Store for Android phone apps into an illegal monopoly following a four-week trial in an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Donato told lawyers for both parties not to revisit the jury's verdict, which is now “carved in stone.” He also said that the case is about “competing generally,” and he is “not looking for a relief that gives a helping hand just to Epic.”\n\nThe verdict has given Epic a chance to persuade Donato to impose sweeping restrictions and other changes on how Google manages the distribution of Android apps. Those apps enable a wide range of services on virtually every phone that isn't made by Apple.\n\nAt Thursday's hearing, Donato heard from experts on both sides arguing over Epic's sweeping proposed changes to Google's app store. Under Epic’s key proposals, Google would be required to make all Android apps in the Play Store available to competing stores — and also distribute rival app stores directly to consumers who want to download them. Basically, it would have to put competing app stores in its own app store to boost rivals' chances of getting discovered by consumers.\n\nThis, Epic argues, would help level the playing field for new and smaller competitors since Google‘s app is boosted by a network effect — it has the dominant app and the most users.\n\nThese remedies would eventually expire, although it is not clear when. Epic proposed six years, but it was unclear if Donato would allow that. Six years, he said, “strikes me as an awfully long time.”\n\nGoogle — which as Donato pointed out filed 90 pages of objections to Epic's proposals earlier this month — argued that its network effect advantages existed long before it gained monopoly power.\n\nEpic also wants Donato to forbid Google from requiring the Play Store to be automatically installed on Android phones and appoint an oversight committee to ensure the new order is followed.\n\nIn court documents leading up to Thursday’s hearing, Google argued Epic’s proposals would have a chilling effect on the Play Store that would do more harm than good for the consumers and developers of Android apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the hearing, Donato appeared skeptical of this argument, saying that while Google seems to be assuming “without any evidence” a dark, dystopian future if Epic gets its way, “there is an equally reasonable probability that it will be the best thing that has ever happened, so it is a value-neutral choice.”\n\nTo Google's arguments that rival, unscrupulous app stores could compromise consumer privacy, Donato said the tech giant doesn't have data to support it — and asked if it's “in any way different than what Google already does?”\n\nWhile Google is predicting a “terrifying world of chaos and anarchy” if Epic's proposals are implemented, Donato said, “I just don't buy it.”\n\nThis, he said, is the consequence of breaking antitrust laws.\n\n“You are going to repair the damage, and that means you (might) have a less-than-ideal situation from a competitive perspective for a remedial period,” he said.\n\nAs Apple does on its store for iPhone apps, Google makes billions of dollars annually from its Play Store for Android apps through a commission system that charges a fee of 15% to 30% on a variety of digital transactions. Epic and other makers of popular apps, such as Spotify and Match Group, have been attacking those in-app commissions as an abusive tactic that gouges consumers as well as them.\n\nEpic is pushing Donato to require Google to ban many of the practices that enabled the Play Store to stifle alternatives to the Play Store that would have charged far lower commissions that could help bring down prices and foster more competition that could spawn more innovation.\n\nDonato did not make a ruling Thursday but said closing arguments for the case would likely be held in August. He gave Google 30 days\n\nGoogle is trying to minimize the upheaval to its lucrative Android ecosystem just weeks after its lawyers delivered the closing arguments i n an even more consequential antitrust case targeting its dominant search engine. A ruling in that case filed by the U.S. Justice Department isn't expected until later this summer or autumn.\n\nIn the Play store case, Google contends a series of concessions that it's making as part of a $700 million settlement it made in another antitrust case brought by attorneys general across the U.S. already have ensured there will be more competition.\n\nThe settlement, reached before the Epic case went to trial, will pay at least $2 to each of the more than 100 million consumers covered by it while requiring Google to lower the barriers that have made it difficult for rival options to the Play Store.\n\nEpic, which has derided the attorneys general settlement as ineffectual, is seeking more stringent measures that would handcuff Google and make it easier for rival app stores to connect with consumers with Android phones.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet, Meta Offer Millions to Partner With Hollywood on AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have held discussions with major Hollywood studios about licensing content for use in the tech giants’ artificial intelligence video generation software, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Stock Surges as Sales Forecast Delivers on AI Hopes Harvard Students Walk Out of Commencement Protesting Suspensions Stocks Join Bonds in Falling as Fed-Cut Bets Wane: Markets Wrap SpaceX Weighs Plan to Sell Shares at $200 Billion Valuation Israel to Restart Gaza Talks After Hostage Video Sparks Outrage\n\nBoth companies are developing technology that can create realistic scenes from a text prompt, and have offered tens of millions of dollars to partner with studios in some capacity. Rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft Corp., is having similar conversations. Alphabet, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment on the talks.\n\nHollywood studios are keen to discuss ways to use AI to reduce costs while also protecting themselves from having their work stolen. They are wary of giving films and TV shows to tech companies without control over how that content is used. Just this week, the actress Scarlett Johansson demanded OpenAI stop using a voice that sounded like her to power its chatbot after she refused to work with the company.\n\nBig money is at stake. On Wednesday, News Corp., parent of the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets, agreed to allow OpenAI to use content from more than a dozen of its publications in a deal that could be worth more than $250 million over five years.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery Inc. has expressed a willingness to license some of its programs to train the models, but only for specific divisions — not its entire library. Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc. aren’t willing to license their content to these companies, but have expressed an interest in other types of collaborations.\n\nHollywood studios are already using artificial intelligence in production, as are many filmmakers. Tyler Perry has used the technology to re-create the makeup he wears for his Madea character in movies. Director Robert Zemeckis has deployed artificial intelligence to de-age Tom Hanks in an upcoming film.\n\nBut a new crop of tools, including OpenAI’s Sora and Alphabet’s Veo, go a step further by promising to help filmmakers quickly create vivid, hyper-realistic clips based on just a few words of description. Their capabilities have elicited excitement and anxiety in Hollywood, where actors and writers staged a monthslong strike last year over concern about how AI could take their jobs.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerry, an actor, filmmaker and studio owner, was so amazed by a demonstration of Sora that he put plans for an $800 million studio expansion on hold earlier this year. He has been vocal about the opportunities AI represents for studios, but also in raising the alarm about the technology’s impact on labor. He has called for the industry to rally together and formulate some sort of regulations. “If not, I just don’t see how we survive,” he told the Hollywood Reporter in February.\n\nThe music industry has adopted a tough stance against AI use. Universal Music Group NV sued Anthropic, a budding AI startup, for copying song lyrics and temporarily pulled its music from TikTok in part to secure protections for its artists. Sony Music Group sent letters to hundreds of partners this month warning them not to train any AI models on its music.\n\nNo major studio has so far sued a tech company over AI, despite fears that many of these models have already been trained on their copyrighted material. They would like to find a way to make AI work for them rather than fight a new technology that could help significantly reshape the industry. But studios have yet to agree to major commercial relationships around the use of AI with the largest technology companies.\n\nHollywood executives worry that licensing conversations will lead to tension between studios and their creative partners. For example, studios believe they have the rights to license a movie they own to an AI company. But if that company uses the movie to train its AI model on the face or voice of an actor in that movie, the actor would also want the opportunity to approve of it or not. A few actors have already struck deals with AI companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn’t A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade How the $17 Desk Salad Won\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang believes Tesla’s (TSLA) full self-driving (FSD) system is the most advanced system out right now. It also just so happens that Tesla’s FSD is powered by Nvidia's chips.\n\n“Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,” Huang said in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"One of the things that's really revolutionary about version 12 of Tesla's full self-driving is that it's an end-to-end generative model,\" Huang added.\n\n\"It learns from watching videos — surround video — and it learns about how to drive end-to-end, and using generative AI, predict the path and how to understand and how to steer the car. So the technology is really revolutionary and the work that [Tesla’s] doing is incredible.\"\n\nTesla's latest FSD, version 12, is currently in beta mode and was rolled out in 30-day free trials to new owners earlier this year. FSD currently costs $99 a month or $8,000 up-front. Tesla reported in April that FSD had over 1.3 billion cumulative miles driven since its debut in March 2021.\n\nFSD is still considered a Level 2 autonomous system, meaning it requires supervised use, and has been subject to recalls and government inquiries into its capabilities.

(JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported automotive revenue of $329 million, a small sliver of the $22.6 billion in its data center business but up 17% sequentially and up 11% year over year.\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the company’s earnings call she expects automotive to be the “largest enterprise vertical within [the] Data Center [segment] this year,” and a potential multibillion-dollar business for the company.\n\nMost of Nvidia's Data Center revenue, which tallied $22.6 billion the first quarter, came from consumer internet customers. Cloud providers, or the so-called hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), accounted for a \"mid-40s percentage\" of this segment's revenue.\n\nHuang also told Yahoo Finance he expects one day \"every single car\" will have some level of autonomous ability — a development that will require huge amounts of computing power.\n\n“This technology is very similar to the technology of large language models, but it requires just an enormous training facility,\" Huang said, referring to Tesla's FSD system. \"And the reason for that is because there's videos, the data rate of video, the amount of data of video is so, so high.\"\n\nFor example, in order to boost Tesla’s ability to process that amount of data, Nvidia said it helped the company expand its FSD training AI cluster to 35,000 Nvidia Hopper H100 GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Nvidia's other automotive sector clients include Mercedes, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Hyundai, as well as Chinese EV upstarts like BYD (BYD) and NIO (NIO).\n\nWall Street is also bullish on Nvidia’s automotive business.\n\nIn a note published Thursday, analysts at JPMorgan boosted their Nvidia price target to $1,150 from $850, modeling the chipmaker’s data center business with a 20-30% annual growth rate with Nvidia monetizing \"an incremental ~$14 billion of auto revenue pipeline\" over the next three to four years.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The days of whackadoodle hallucinations from generative artificial intelligence might be few and far between now, but AI still can get things so completely wrong it borders on the comical.\n\nGoogle is learning this the hard way as it rolls out AI-generated answers into search—and the internet is not letting things slide. Social media has been loaded with examples of the AI’s flubs, which range from the sublime to the absolutely ridiculous.\n\nLeading the pack is the now-widely-shared example of Google suggesting you “mix about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue into the sauce” to keep cheese from sliding off of your pizza slice. The source of this advice (which we strongly suggest you do not follow) is seemingly a joke post from Reddit made 11 years ago by a user whose name we can’t repeat in a family financial publication. (The answers are almost word for word.)\n\nAsk Google which presidents went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and you’ll get an answer that not only makes history teachers weep, but could bring to mind a George Romero zombie movie. Andrew Jackson, for instance, who died in 1845, graduated in 2005, Google’s AI says. William Harrison, meanwhile, graduated in 1953 and 1974, which is especially impressive seeing as he died 31 days after his inauguration in 1841. Harry Truman, John Kennedy and others also graduated long after their death.\n\nThe source for this misinformation came from the school, actually—only Google AI failed to read the part of the page that said these were the graduation years of alumni with presidential names. No actual president has ever graduated from the school.\n\nOther examples of the AI’s goofs include:\n\nGoogle's AI Overviews appear to be presenting comedic / sarcastic / satire content as fact pic.twitter.com/gsXf8Y8eyi\n\n— Joe Youngblood (@YoungbloodJoe) May 21, 2024\n\nGood ol’ Google AI: telling you to do the exact things you *are not supposed to do* when bitten by a rattlesnake.\n\nFrom mushrooms to snakebites, AI content is genuinely dangerous. pic.twitter.com/UZXgBjsre9\n\n— ern.

        "title": "Bird Flu Is More Widespread Among Dairy Cows, Sewage Tests Suggest",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A Michigan farmworker who tested positive for bird flu is just the second person to have been infected since an outbreak in US cattle appeared in March. Surveillance of sewage suggests the virus may be more widespread among dairy cows than reported, raising workers’ risk.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarvard Students Walk Out of Commencement Protesting Suspensions Nvidia Stock Surges as Sales Forecast Delivers on AI Hopes Stocks Join Bonds in Falling as Fed-Cut Bets Wane: Markets Wrap Israel to Restart Gaza Talks After Hostage Video Sparks Outrage Citi Trader Got 711 Warning Messages Before Sparking Flash Crash\n\nAcademic and industry-run labs have been leading the way toward more nuanced and complete information about the H5N1 virus’s range by analyzing wastewater. They found bird flu in sewage samples collected before the virus had been identified in US cows. They’re seeing signs in cities that are far from infected cattle herds. And they’re already giving the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention better information about where to focus its efforts.\n\nWhile rarely seen in humans, the H5N1 strain has considered a pandemic threat for decades because it often jumps between species, sometimes causing lethal disease in people. As farmers resist testing, the US needs to expand its monitoring of sewage, particularly in rural areas around farms where the pathogen may be spreading, said Paul Friedrichs, director of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy.\n\n“We’re going to need to do more work as a nation on how do we better structure wastewater surveillance in areas that don’t have or aren’t on a municipal wastewater system,” Friedrichs, a retired major general and joint staff surgeon at the Pentagon, said in an interview. “That’s the gap we’re going to have to figure out how to bridge.”\n\nConcerned about lost income, dairy farms have resisted efforts to test cows and workers, potentially concealing the true scope of the virus’s spread.\n\nViruses are often excreted in feces, which prompted scientists to turn to wastewater early in the pandemic to track Covid’s spread, hunt for new trends and spot the emergence of concerning variants. Although it’s unable to show whether the source is infected humans, animals or products like milk, wastewater surveillance paints a more complete picture of where pathogens are emerging across broad geographic areas.\n\nIn Texas, for example, 19 out of 23 wastewater sites were found to contain traces of the virus between early March and the end of April, according to Texas Wastewater Environmental Biomonitoring. Meanwhile, the state has some 400 dairy farms, and just 14 herds have tested positive for bird flu to date, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Biden administration officials, who asked not to be named while describing the federal response, said they’re worried about the time it took the government to first spot the outbreak in cattle, which likely began in late 2023 after contact with sick migratory birds. That monthslong delay shows the limitations of US pandemic preparedness efforts and a disjointed public-health system, the officials said.\n\nFriedrichs said the US should seek the help of additional wastewater experts and operations to develop “a more robust national picture.”\n\nTracking Technology\n\nSpecialists in the field include Verily, the Alphabet Inc. life-sciences unit that began working with Stanford University and Emory University to monitor wastewater during the pandemic. With funding from Google co-founder Sergey Brin and others, Verily expanded testing for more than dozen viruses to 190 sites, and in October, it was tapped to support the CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance System that includes hundreds more facilities.\n\nSince it was first detected in US cattle in March, bird flu has been found in 52 herds from nine states. However, before the first reported case, Verily’s top wastewater scientist Bradley White noticed a strange trend: influenza A, a viral category that includes H5N1, was spiking in parts of the country. White had a hunch the surge was driven by bird flu, and developed a test for genetic signatures typical of H5N1 and its H5 cousins.\n\nUsing the assay to look back through old wastewater samples, White found an H5 virus had been present in Amarillo, Texas, as early as February — weeks before the White House was first alerted of the emerging outbreak. That shows the potential for wastewater surveillance as an early warning signal for bird flu, White said.\n\nIt appears bird flu has “run its course” in Texas, he said, as overall influenza A levels appear to be declining in the state. Verily announced this week that it had expanded its search for H5 markers to all 190 sites in an effort to better track the outbreak.\n\nRecognizing the need for more monitoring, the CDC is also putting an additional $3 million into wastewater analysis, part of a $93 million package aimed at improving H5N1 surveillance. The agency said in 2022 that it had put more than $100 million toward testing for Covid in wastewater, and expected the funds to last for an additional three years. In March, it made a fiscal 2025 budget request for an additional $20 million to test sewage for emerging diseases.\n\nThe CDC is also starting a project to check sewage at 10 new locations close to livestock, and launching a study that would help distinguish whether human or animals were responsible for virus detected in wastewater. Last week, it launched an online wastewater data dashboard tracking influenza A. Between late April and mid-May, only two of six Michigan-based wastewater sites on the CDC dashboard showed moderate levels of influenza A.\n\nPotential Mutations\n\nConcern about H5N1 soared about two decades ago when a strain of the virus began running rampant in poultry, occasionally infecting people. Health officials worldwide began looking for signs of human-to-human transmission that might have signaled a potential pandemic before the outbreak finally subsided. While some human cases have been severe, even deadly, the two farmworkers infected in the recent US outbreak both had mild symptoms and recovered. No transmission between people has been seen.\n\nH5N1 infections in cows can lead to decreased milk production and may raise their risk of other conditions, like pneumonia. Pasteurization kills the virus, and there’s no evidence of danger from commercial milk, cheese or ice cream.\n\nHealth officials are particularly concerned about tracking the virus on dairy farms where infected cows frequently come in contact with workers, and mutated viruses may find opportunities to infect humans. The dangers the virus has shown in the past raises the stakes for wastewater monitoring.\n\n“The risk is the longer this outbreak continues, the more opportunities there may be for a spillover jump from an animal species to a human,” said Al Ozonoff, an infectious disease scientist at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The next event experts worry about is, he said is “some viral evolution which creates an opportunity for human-to-human transmission.”\n\n--With assistance from Ilena Peng.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn’t A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade How the $17 Desk Salad Won\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Justice Department is widening its antitrust crackdown as it goes after Live Nation (LYV), filing a lawsuit Thursday that seeks a breakup of the entertainment giant.\n\nUS prosecutors and a group of states argue that Live Nation used its Ticketmaster ticketing monopoly to suppress competition. The lawsuit follows a two-year investigation into the company.\n\nThe suit comes 14 years after DOJ approved a merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster is a dominant provider of ticket sales across the US that processes more than 80% of sales, while Live Nation owns and operates hundreds of high-profile venues and is a giant concert promoter.\n\nThe combined company has long faced criticism of what lawmakers and regulators consider to be exorbitant fees, problematic customer service and unfair practices.\n\nLive Nation’s stock was down roughly 5% as the suit was filed in the Southern District of New York.\n\n\"Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, cited by multiple media outlets.\n\n\"The result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts, smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices for ticketing services,\" Garland added. \"It is time to break up Live Nation.\"\n\nLive Nation immediately refuted the lawsuit, calling the allegations \"baseless.\"\n\n\"The DOJ’s complaint attempts to portray Live Nation and Ticketmaster as the cause of fan frustration with the live entertainment industry,\" said Dan Wall, Live Nation executive vice president for corporate and regulatory affairs.\n\n\"It blames concert promoters and ticketing companies—neither of which control ticket prices—for high ticket prices. It ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from increasing production costs to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary tickets cost.\"\n\nThe new legal action is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nThe administration has alleged antitrust violations by tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), while taking to trial a case filed by the Trump administration against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also trying to block mergers that could eliminate competition in other industries. Joe Berchtold, president and CFO of Live Nation Entertainment, testified before a Senate committee in January 2023, in the wake of problems surrounding access to ticket purchases for Taylor Swift performances. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Win McNamee via Getty Images)\n\nSince the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was approved in 2010, the company has been at the center of antitrust concerns, with critics taking aim at sky-high ticket fees and accusing the entertainment giant of anti-competitive behavior.\n\nIn 2020, the Justice Department updated the company's consent decree, an agreement which barred Live Nation from strong-arming venues into using Ticketmaster for its tours, and extended it until 2025.\n\nIt did so after it said it found evidence the company repeatedly and over the course of several years engaged in conduct that violated its earlier agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Capitol Hill ramped up its fight against Live Nation during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at the start of last year following a 2022 fiasco with Taylor Swift concert tickets.\n\nTicketmaster's online software struggled to handle the demand for presale orders and fans complained they were denied tickets as they tried to buy.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nAt the time, multiple senators called for a breakup of the company, although some Wall Street analysts have argued a breakup wouldn't necessarily solve the problems surrounding the unregulated secondary ticket market.\n\nAnalysts have also said Live Nation would be a \"shell of itself\" without Ticketmaster as that entity makes up the bulk of the profits.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, the company saw its fiscal year 2023 revenue surge 36% year over year to $22.7 billion, while its earnings per share more than doubled to $1.37. Concert attendance climbed 20% as over 145 million fans attended over 50,000 events.\n\nAnalyst Matthew Harrigan sees a DOJ lawsuit against Live Nation as being \"significantly politicized\" amid the US election year, and says the department \"has been generally unsuccessful in applying horizontal M&A theories.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that any targeted unwinding of the 2010 Live Nation Ticketmaster merger likely has only a remote likelihood under accepted antitrust law although we would be wary of the likely initial New York State Federal Court venue,\" he said.\n\nDeutsche Bank, meanwhile, said \"the pursuit of a breakup of Live Nation by the DOJ is somewhat surprising, and raises the stakes of the investigation.\"\n\n\"We would anticipate that Live Nation plans to defend its position in court, and could still win, but this issue is likely to remain an overhang for some time,\" the bank added, noting a possible drag on the stock price.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Steve Cohen's latest portfolio to see some of his top AI stock picks.\n\nSince Alphabet(GOOG) ranks 5thth in our list of the 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen, the stock deserves a detailed look.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen is one of the few hedge fund managers who almost always dazzles with his outperformance and prescient bets. Cohen, who also owns The New York Mets, founded SAC Capital back in 1992, and since then through 2009 lost money only once. A Bloomberg report earlier this year said that Point72 Asset Management has been able to raise so much cash recently that it's starting to decline external money. The fund has reportedly raised about about $12.8 billion since 2020.\n\nPoint72's main fund returned about 11% in 2023, and 12% in the previous year.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management runs a highly diversified portfolio. As of the end of the March quarter, the portfolio's net worth was over $41.2 billion, with tech stocks accounting for 17% of the total portfolio.\n\nUnlike long-term value investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, Cohen moves with speed and adapts quickly. He's been like this for decades. When he was in Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he would often skip classes to watch stock movements at a local brokerage. He took pride in predicting stock movements based on their direction. Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen\n\nPoint72 Brings Macro Teams on Board\n\nCohen, worth over $19 billion, is yet again adapting to the quickly changing global financial landscape as investors demand steady returns. Earlier this year, it was reported that Cohen and his team is expanding macro teams at Point72 as the global economy resets to the new era of high interest rates. The report said that the fund would establish as many as 51 macro trading teams.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nSteve Cohen's Q1'2024 Stake: $258,046,983\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has become a top horse in the AI race, albeit with reactive approach, as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continues to unleash AI features in its products. Steve Cohen increased his stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 443% in the first quarter of 2024, concluding the period with a $258 million stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nBronte Capital Amalthea Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our biggest position is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the holding company for Google. It is currently about 12 percent of funds under management. This has been a large position for over ten years.\n\nWe bought a large position in Google in October 20104, and the stock immediately dropped 11 percent.\n\nThat was an astonishingly good purchase and if we had held it all from October 2010 until the end of this month the gain would have been about 1300 percent.\n\nAlas we did not hold it all. We have trimmed it many times – and it is now merely a large position. (We have lived to regret every single trim…)..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a notable AI stock pick of Cohen, it's not the best one.\n\nAlphabet ranks 5th in our list of the 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and A New Dawn Is Coming to US Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Buying These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks. Should You Buy Too?",
        "content": "Keeping tabs on what billionaire hedge fund managers do is a great way to check your investment strategy. While blindly following them isn't advisable, seeing what they're doing and checking that against your own thoughts is a good way of seeing if you're on the same page, especially when there's a hot trend like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe 13F filings for Q1 were recently released, revealing some common themes across hedge funds. While many stocks were bought, one is a clear favorite.\n\nAlphabet was a common purchase among all three hedge funds\n\nI'll focus on three hedge funds: Tiger Global Management, Soros Fund Management, and Bridgewater Associates. These funds are run by billionaires Chase Coleman, George Soros, and Ray Dalio, respectively. In Q1, all three of these funds had sizable purchases of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). For Bridgewater and Tiger, Alphabet was the most purchased stock in Q1.\n\nThis is a large nod of confidence to Alphabet, especially since many saw it struggle to roll out AI products initially. However, its Gemini generative AI technology has dramatically improved and is now starting to integrate AI into search results to summarize what you've searched for. Many investors have been waiting for Alphabet to announce this technology, and now that it has, it reinforces the fact that Alphabet is a top player in the tech world.\n\nBut that wasn't the only AI stock these hedge funds were buying.\n\nBridgewater also bought Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). While Tiger Global didn't buy any of these stocks in Q1, it's already heavily exposed, as Meta and Nvidia make up nearly 20% and 5% of its portfolio, respectively. As a result, it shouldn't be surprising that Tiger didn't add any more of these stocks due to its hefty concentration already. Soros Fund Management doesn't own either of these companies, but it isn't as tech-heavy as the other two.\n\nMeta is similar to Alphabet in that its primary business is advertising. So to improve its standing in this field, Meta has rolled out generative AI tools to advertisers, and is also starting to develop its own chips to process its AI workloads.\n\nNvidia hardly needs any introduction in the AI world, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are at the core of training and processing AI models. Despite its massive rise already, Nvidia continues to see incredibly strong demand, which will continue until all AI infrastructure is built.\n\nWith billionaires buying these three stocks, investors might be prompted to buy them now. However, these stocks were purchased between the start of the year and March 31, so it has been nearly two months since this activity occurred. So are they still buys now?\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta and Alphabet are still reasonably priced stocks\n\nAll three of these businesses are mature companies undergoing drastic changes. So I'll use their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to value them, because it considers the business shifts occurring. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNvidia trades at a healthy premium to Meta and Alphabet simply because it's rapidly growing and has the potential to do that for many years. This makes Nvidia one of the harder stocks to assess on the stock market.\n\nAlphabet and Meta trade at much more reasonable valuations and only hold slight premiums to the broader S&P 500's forward P/E of 21.6.Still, each posted solid earnings growth in Q1 (Alphabet's earnings per share rose 62%, while Meta's rose 120%), so they are on the right track.\n\nOf the three, Alphabet and Meta are probably the biggest no-brainer buys. They are executing at a high level and can be purchased at a reasonable price. Nvidia requires more work, and investors must understand the expectations built into the stock, as they are quite high. But it may still be a viable option for investors to scoop up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The email did not specify which part of the law OVD-Info was accused of violating.\n\nThe channel, Kak Teper (What's Going On), has 100,000 subscribers and features interviews with Russian opposition figures and political news segments that often touch on the war.\n\n\"We are consulting with YouTube and Google and trying to explain that the demand to block our channel is an act of political censorship,\" said OVD-Info spokesperson Dmitrii Anisimov. He said the group's other YouTube channel was not affected.\n\nContacted by Reuters two times about Youtube's discussions with OVD-Info, a spokesperson for YouTube did not respond.

        "title": "Analysis-Google acquiring HubSpot would bolster bid to challenge Microsoft",
        "content": "By Milana Vinn\n\n(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet's potential acquisition of HubSpot, a U.S. marketing software maker with a market value of $31 billion, would boost its ability to compete against Microsoft in offering cloud-based applications to companies.\n\nReuters reported last month that Google was exploring an offer for HubSpot. Such a deal would be Google's biggest, expanding its products and applications that serve businesses, analysts and investment bankers said in interviews.\n\nGoogle is already challenging the dominance of Microsoft's Office platform through its Google Workspace collaboration offerings. Buying HubSpot would make Google a competitor in the so-called customer relationship management sector, which Microsoft caters to with its Dynamics 365 products, said Cowen analyst Derrick Wood.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It does appear that Google has aspirations to try to take market share from Microsoft in the productivity suite, and they can use HubSpot to bundle applications together for clients,\" Wood said.\n\nRepresentatives for Google, HubSpot and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHubSpot, which makes marketing software for small and medium-sized businesses, is seeking ways to maintain sales growth in the face of a wider economic slowdown.\n\nHubSpot CEO Yamini Rangan said on the company's first-quarter earnings call this month that client demand had weakened, as small businesses fret about the economic impact of high interest rates.\n\nHubSpot has maintained growth despite clients downsizing, reporting a 23% rise in sales and 15% operating margin in the first quarter. However, equity analysts have warned that its shares would have taken a hit were it not for Google's acquisition interest.\n\nMost analysts covering HubSpot lowered their price target on the stock following its latest earnings report. Some have warned that the company's niche in serving smaller businesses, which sets it apart from bigger enterprise competitors such as Salesforce and Oracle, could become a weakness if a downturn makes financing harder to secure for those clients.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Tighter lending standards could have an outsized negative impact on access to funding for small and medium-sized businesses (that are HubSpot's clients),\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note on May 9.\n\nHubSpot specializes in so-called \"inbound marketing,\" in which the consumer initiates engagement with a brand. HubSpot clients use its software to produce advertising content that consumers click on online or follow up on.\n\nInbound marketing largely relies on search engines and social media to attract customers and convert them into leads, offering many synergies with Google, whose parent Alphabet also owns popular video streaming service YouTube.\n\nWhile Microsoft has focused on attracting big corporate customers, Google has sought to also appeal to smaller companies, which make up the bulk of HubSpot's client base.\n\nAcquiring HubSpot would deliver Google a trove of valuable sales leads, filling a gap as it removes tracking applications known as \"cookies\" from its Chrome browser in the second half of 2024, said Stifel analyst Parker Lane.\n\n\"Purging third-party cookies from Chrome ... places a greater emphasis on first-party data, which HubSpot bring an abundance of to the table,\" Lane said.\n\nAI IN ADVERTISING\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and other executives have said that Google views advertising as a key route to making money off its advances in artificial intelligence.\n\n\"AI innovation across our ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types,\" Google's Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said during the company's first-quarter earnings call last month.\n\nGoogle clinching a deal for HubSpot would risk a challenge from antitrust regulators, even as many experts agree the tie-up would not curb competition given the lack of business overlap in the two companies. This is because of regulators' growing aversion to technology giants getting bigger through acquisitions.\n\nMorningStar analyst Dan Romanoff said Google could decide the potential deal's benefits outweigh the possibility of a regulatory challenge.\n\n\"Amazon is the clear leader in the cloud, Microsoft is No. 2 and Google is kind of distant third. One can imagine Google saying, 'If we buy HubSpot, that'd be like having Microsoft Dynamics 365, so it'll make us more competitive there,'\" Romanoff said.\n\n(Reporting by Milana Vinn in New York; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Richard Chang)",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe internet gatekeeper is selling a new key.\n\nAfter organizing digital slices of the world's knowledge and neatly presenting that information infused with advertising, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), the search world's top dog, is staging its next act of transformation.\n\nPowered, of course, by generative AI.\n\nAI-generated answers to web searches stand to replace a flurry of clicks. Neat summaries and, eventually, distilled explanations of complex tasks as well as answers to multistep queries will come out the other end of a Google Search bar.\n\nBut the same AI-powered reinvention could upend the click-based, ad-supported business model that solidified Google's dominant status in the first place.\n\nThe new format, with an AI overview followed by sponsored ads, effectively buries the 10 blue organic links that built Google's business as well as the sponsored links that used to make up the bulk of Google's search advertising.\n\n\"Not only is it unclear how ads will look and perform in the new layout, it's a foregone conclusion that consumers will be less likely to click through to view source material,\" said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at eMarketer.\n\nAnd why would you, with AI Overviews answering your queries and questions without even needing to touch the scroll key?\n\nFor years, Google has soft-launched its zero-click capabilities by slowly expanding its search modules with info boxes from Wikipedia, weather, maps, reviewed places, people, movies, and much more.\n\nAnd now, with the AI-driven summarizations, users who previously might have been tempted to venture outside Google's modules may end their search journey paying even less attention to a sponsored link.\n\nOn top of all this, measuring the effectiveness of an ad will also get trickier in a new paradigm of conversational search.\n\n\"Without clicks as a reliable signal, it'll be hard to tell whether a consumer notices an ad, much less whether the ad influences a purchase decision,\" Mitchell-Wolf said.\n\nIn space no one can hear you scream. And in an AI-powered conservational answer engine, no one can hear you click. Perhaps we may be telling our kids about \"browsing\" someday. And so marketers will have to resort to other forms of measurement.\n\nBut AI-powered search could also lead to new ways of making money from users and their attention.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd Google has an array of platforms to condition customers on new AI services, to test out how they perform, and to experiment with advertising formats.\n\nGoogle insists that even as its search products evolve, the company will remain focused on sending valuable traffic to content creators and merchants, sharing the wealth, as it were.\n\nEarly findings shared by Google suggest that when people click on links from AI overviews, they are more likely to spend additional time on the site. Which may simply be cold comfort to businesses losing clicks.\n\nThe company does have incentives not to blow up the ad-supported search model. If fewer websites are able to publish high-quality content without dependable ad revenue, then the quality of Google search results will suffer.\n\nBut for individual websites and businesses that are reliant on Search, any change to how Google surfaces their content could be detrimental.\n\nAs Lily Ray, vice president of SEO strategy & research at Amsive, wrote in an analysis this week, Reddit (RDDT), Amazon (AMZN), and other major sites were among the SEO winners following Google's March updates to Search. Google taketh away, but Google sometimes giveth.\n\nFor Google and its backers, the company isn't jeopardizing its own search-world dominance, but attempting to justify it for a future where its most important product, and the notion of a web search, isn't guaranteed. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google Parent Alphabet Is Selling Shares of 2 Hypergrowth Stocks and Piling Into a Promising Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company",
        "content": "Once every quarter, institutional money managers with more than $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's brightest investment minds have been buying and selling in the latest quarter. However, 13Fs aren't just limited to traditional fund managers.\n\nSome of Wall Street's largest and most-influential companies also invest their capital in businesses they believe can change the world -- or at the very least that can make their company and shareholders richer. The nearly $379 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway serves as a good example. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOne such company that isn't afraid to put its capital to work in game-changing investment ideas is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, streaming site YouTube, and globally dominant internet search engine Google. Google has accounted for at least a 90% share of worldwide monthly internet search dating back more than nine years.\n\nBased on Alphabet's latest 13F filing, it had more than $2.5 billion invested across 43 companies in the technology, healthcare, and financial sectors. What's of particular interest is that Alphabet pared down its holdings in two of its largest hypergrowth companies, while absolutely piling into a rising superstar in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena.\n\nAlphabet reduces its stake in CrowdStrike Holdings by a third\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of Alphabet's investment chess moves during the March-ended quarter is that it reduced its stake in cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) by exactly one third (it sold 427,894 shares). Whereas CrowdStrike comprised more than 15% of invested assets at the end of 2023, it now accounts for just shy of 11% of Alphabet's investments.\n\nThe logical reason for this selling activity is very likely valuation. Even factoring in CrowdStrike's annual sales growth rate of nearly 30%, the company is valued at close to 17 times forecast revenue for next year, and trades at more than 70 times forward-year consensus earnings. Considering that the stock market is historically pricey at the moment, any correction could hit companies with high valuation premiums, like CrowdStrike, the hardest.\n\nBut beyond valuation, there's no reason to sell this cream-of-the-crop cybersecurity solutions provider.\n\nCrowdStrike's superior growth rate is all thanks to Falcon, which is its AI and machine learning-driven security platform. Falcon oversees trillions of events each week, which continually make it smarter and more adept at identifying and stopping potential threats to end users.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough pretty much every key performance indicator for CrowdStrike is moving in the right direction, add-on sales tell the story best. CrowdStrike offers 27 cloud modules on its Falcon platform, and 64% of its clients have purchased at least five of these cloud-module subscriptions. Thanks to existing clients continually upping their spending, CrowdStrike's adjusted subscription gross margin reached 80% in its latest quarter.\n\nLastly, don't forget that CrowdStrike and Alphabet's Google Cloud have an existing strategic partnership in place. Though Alphabet is a seller of CrowdStrike stock, the two companies continue to work together.\n\nAlphabet more than halved its position in DexCom\n\nThe other big surprise found in Alphabet's 13F is that it sold a little over 51% of its prior stake (1,891,112 shares sold) in medical-device company DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM). Though DexCom was Alphabet's largest investment holding at the end of 2023, comprising 21.2% of invested assets, it's now fallen to third in the pecking order at 9.9% of invested assets.\n\nSimilar to CrowdStrike, valuation might have been the impetus that had Alphabet's investment team pressing the sell button. Despite sustained annual sales growth of near 20%, this maker of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) is valued at 10 times consensus sales for 2025 and roughly 58 times forward-year earnings per share (EPS).\n\nFurthermore, there have concerns that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist drugs could adversely affect the need for CGMs. However, DexCom has alleviated these concerns by pointing to studies that show GLP-1 users are more likely to use their CGMs.\n\nThe biggest factor working in DexCom's favor is time. Between 2000 and 2021, the number of people worldwide with diabetes more than tripled to 537 million. By 2045, IDF Diabetes Atlas predicts 783 million people globally will be diabetic. The addressable market for CGMs keeps expanding, which gives DexCom a seemingly unlimited double-digit growth runway.\n\nInnovation has played a key role in DexCom's success, too. The company has developed multiple generations of CGMs, and made regular improvements to its devices that allow for wireless readings and the seamless sharing of vital data with primary-care physicians.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's life sciences division (known as Verily) and DexCom have been partners for nine years. This collaborative partnership is unlikely to end anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe parent of Google makes GitLab its largest position\n\nWith DexCom removed from its pedestal as Alphabet's largest holding, and CrowdStrike staying put in the No. 2 slot, it's development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) software developer GitLab(NASDAQ: GTLB) that's now taken the crown in Alphabet's more than $2.5 billion investment portfolio. Alphabet purchased over 7.11 million shares of GitLab in the March-ended quarter, which increased its previous stake in the company by about 269%!\n\nGitLab's DevSecOps platform helps businesses throughout the software development lifecycle. The key aspect of GitLab's platform is the automated integration of security throughout this development and implementation process.\n\nWhat might be particularly attractive for Alphabet is the role artificial intelligence could play in growing GitLab's top-and-bottom line. A perfect example being the introduction of AI capabilities within GitLab Duo Pro. These features include coding suggestions, which can be particularly useful for large language models, as well as Duo Chat, which can generate and process text to identity useful information.\n\nFrom an operating standpoint, GitLab appears to be firing on all cylinders. The company is profitable on an adjusted basis and generating positive free cash flow. Further, Wall Street is forecasting sales growth of at least 25% in the current and upcoming year, which is to be expected with a dollar-based net retention rate of 130%. This figure shows that existing clients are spending 30% more on a year-over-year basis with GitLab.\n\nThe keep with the common theme of this list, Alphabet's Google Cloud has an ongoing partnership with GitLab. The latter is providing AI-driven solutions that allow Google Cloud to more quickly and securely roll out solutions to its customers.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "You may not realize it, but last week marked one of the most important data releases of the quarter for investors -- and I'm not talking about the highly anticipated April inflation report.\n\nMay 15 was the deadline for institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows investors to look over the proverbial shoulders of Wall Street's greatest investors to see what they were buying and selling in the latest quarter (in this instance, the quarter ended in March).\n\nSince the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been credited with pushing the broad-market indexes to record highs, it's only logical to examine how Wall Street's smartest billionaire investors approached these companies in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm talking about seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country today, including:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhat these stocks share in common is a massive outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500 over the trailing-10-year period, along with well-defined competitive advantages. For instance, Alphabet's Google has maintained at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back nine years. Meanwhile, Apple has the most robust capital-return program on the planet among publicly traded companies. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it's repurchased $674 billion of its own stock. Buybacks of this magnitude can provide a hearty lift to earnings per share.\n\nHowever, billionaires have very different outlooks for these seven stocks. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, billionaires dumped shares of two Magnificent Seven stocks, while absolutely piling into another.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires sent to the chopping block: Nvidia\n\nThe first member of the Magnificent Seven that prominent billionaire investors seemingly wanted nothing to do with in the first quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia. Just as we witnessed during the fourth quarter, eight well-known billionaires were sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would billionaires sell what's arguably been the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street? Aside from simple profit-taking, there are a few potential red flags that Wall Street's brightest investors may be focusing on.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia is set to face increased competition from all angles. Although it's well publicized that external competitors will be vying for graphics processing unit (GPU) market share in AI-accelerated data centers this year, the bigger threat may come from Nvidia's own top customers.\n\nInterestingly, Magnificent Seven components Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four top customers -- about 40% of net sales. Each of these companies is developing their own AI-GPUs to deploy in collaboration with Nvidia's H100 GPUs in their high-compute data centers. The internal development of AI-GPUs from other Magnificent Seven businesses strongly suggests that we're witnessing a peak in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nHistory has also been incredibly unkind to next-big-thing investment trends. Over the last three decades, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation or trend that didn't undergo a bubble-bursting event fairly early into its existence. Investors commonly overestimate the uptake and enterprise adoption of new technologies, which leads to bubbles. If the artificial intelligence bubble were to follow history and burst, no company would be hit harder than Nvidia, which saw its sales more than double last year because of AI-GPU demand.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires showed to the door: Meta Platforms\n\nThe second surprising Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires were casting aside during the quarter ended in March is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms. Nine successful billionaires -- or 10, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Meta stock, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,259,650 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,313,528 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,164,151 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (779,637 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (735,911 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (727,500 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (175,614 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (29,157 shares)\n\nThe top reason behind this selling was very likely profit-taking. Since hitting its bear market low in 2022, shares of Meta had gained close to 500%.\n\nBillionaires may also have been leery about Meta's somewhat unpredictable capital expenditure forecasts. Shares came under pressure in 2022 because of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's desire to spend on the metaverse and augmented/virtual reality innovations. They began rallying in a big way last year when spending forecasts were reined in a bit. But based on Meta's 2024 guidance, it appears as if Zuckerberg and his team are willing to aggressively spend, once again, on AI and other innovations that may not have a sizable payoff for years to come.\n\nThe third possibility for this selling activity might be concern about the health of the U.S. economy. Meta generates nearly 98% of its sales from advertising, and ad spending is highly cyclical. The stock market is incredibly pricey at the moment, and a historic decline in M2 money supply -- the first since the Great Depression -- suggests a recession might occur in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBut unlike Nvidia, I believe billionaires will regret paring down their stakes in Meta. It owns the top social media assets worldwide (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger), and has been able to sustain strong ad pricing power in most economic climates. Meta remains one of the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, based on forward-year cash flow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire investors can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nWhile trading activity in the Magnificent Seven leaned decisively to the sell side with Nvidia and Meta, and was mixed with other constituents, the one member that billionaires absolutely couldn't stop buying is e-commerce leader Amazon. Nine billionaire investors were willing buyers of Amazon stock during the first quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAlthough Amazon is best-known for its world-leading online marketplace, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income and cash flow from a couple of its faster-growing ancillary segments. It's these ancillary operations that likely attracted billionaires to buy shares of Amazon hand over fist during the March-ended quarter.\n\nArguably no operating segment is more important than cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, and is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. Best of all, cloud-service margins are significantly higher than online retail margins, which means AWS typically accounts for a majority of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAdvertising services and subscription services are holding their own, as well, with sustained double-digit sales growth. Amazon draws more than 2 billion people to its site each month, which affords it exceptional ad-pricing power. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscriptions in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe final selling point for billionaires might be Amazon's valuation. Since Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business, cash flow is a far better valuation metric than the traditional price-to-earnings ratio. After spending the entirety of the 2010s at a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow, Amazon can be purchased right now for just 12.4 times consensus cash flow for 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "TMUS, T, AMZN: Which “Strong Buy” Communications Play Is Best?",
        "content": "The communications scene is home to some intriguing companies, many of which boast fairly reasonable valuations at this point in the bull market. Undoubtedly, the communications scene entails a high degree of spending. In a falling-rate environment, such heavy spenders may catch more of a break. In any case, the following firms — TMUS, T, and AMZN (even though AMZN may not seem like a communications play at first) — seem worth checking out while the analyst community views them as Strong Buys.\n\nTherefore, let’s check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to get a better gauge of which stock may be the best bet for the long haul.\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)\n\nMany legacy telecom firms fumbled the ball in a big way many years ago, allowing T-Mobile to not only grab the ball but sprint at explosive speed toward the endzone. Today, TMUS stock is pretty much the go-to telecom stock to own if you seek steady gains. Over the past 10 and five years, shares have soared over 380% and 112%, respectively.\n\nThough the momentum has slowed in recent years, with a bit more volatility (shares lost almost 33% from peak to trough of their value in the back half of 2021), I still view T-Mobile as a winner with the means to keep on taking share and powering growth. As such, I’m staying bullish, even if the pace of gains has slowed a bit.\n\nIt’s not just heavy investment in an enviable 5G wireless infrastructure that’s given T-Mobile the edge over rivals, but the firm has also not been afraid to undercut rivals. Whether it’s through aggressive promotions or new plan “types,” T-Mobile certainly stands out as an aggressor in a market of firms that seemingly only know how to play defense.\n\nRecently, T-Mobile unveiled its “Flex” plans, which include a “free” phone for subscribers, among other perks. The plans are also pretty affordable, starting at $50 per month for unlimited 5G data, talk, text, a robocall-blocking service (goodbye annoying spam calls), and a very generous 100GB in cloud storage space courtesy of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google One.\n\nIf that sounds like a deal too good to pass up, that’s because it is, especially in an uncertain economic landscape with many consumers still “hungover” from inflation. At this pace, it seems like TMUS stock is bound to pick up momentum as the company gains more market share while holding onto the share it already has.\n\nIts first-quarter results saw T-Mobile add 532,000 postpaid customers, topping rivals but coming in line with the additions enjoyed in the same quarter a year prior. With the new Flex plan, count me as unsurprised if additions get a big jolt.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of TMUS Stock?\n\nTMUS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 15 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average TMUS stock price target of $188.15 implies 13.7% upside potential.\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T)\n\nAT&T is one of the laggards in the telecom scene, as it’s struggling to catch up to the top dog, T-Mobile. Despite the multi-year slump, the main draw to AT&T stock is the nice dividend (6.33% yield) and the potentially “deep” value to be had in shares. At 7.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), T stock goes for far less than T-Mobile, which boasts an 18.3 times forward P/E at writing. And though T-Mobile recently announced a dividend (current yield of 1.6%), it represents just a fraction of AT&T’s dividend yield.\n\nPersonally, I’d much rather be in the market leader that’s taking share than a firm that’s undergoing a massive transformation where success is no guarantee. As such, I’m neutral on the stock, though I am enticed by its recent deal with satellite network firm AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS), which could put the legacy telecom firm on the cutting edge of tech again with “space-based direct-to-mobile technology.”\n\nCould satellite connectivity be the next frontier for the telecoms? It could be. And it could represent an opportunity for AT&T to hit back at T-Mobile. By investing wisely, AT&T could attract and retain remote consumers who rely on satellite for a decent internet connection.\n\nIn any case, it’s too hard to tell when AT&T’s AST SpaceMobile deal will pay off. It could be many years if not more than a decade. Though less material over the medium term, I view it as an encouraging sign of where AT&T could be looking for next-generation growth.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of T Stock?\n\nT stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with nine Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average T stock price target of $21.25 implies 21.4% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon is an e-commerce and cloud-computing firm that has a hand in many pies, from groceries (think Whole Foods) to video streaming (Prime Video) and even gamer-focused social media (Twitch). The communications scene is just another market that Amazon could look to make a lateral move into as it expands its many service segments.\n\nCall Amazon a digital retailer or cloud service provider, if you will. However, it can pay dividends (not literally) to view the firm as more of a market disruptor that’s not satisfied unless it’s disrupting new markets to fuel its growth profile. Given its ability to sustain growth by targeting new markets, I have to stay bullish even with new all-time highs in sight.\n\nOn the surface, Amazon doesn’t seem to have all that much exposure to communications, at least compared to other media and telecom pure-plays. Digging deeper, though, it becomes more apparent that Amazon is an influential force in the communications scene. In fact, I’d argue that the communications landscape is ripe for disruption and could become a serious growth market for Amazon in the distant future.\n\nLive-streaming platform Twitch and audiobook platform Audible are just two “media” businesses that the firm can build off of in a big way. Such businesses represent a sliver of the overall Amazon pie today, but perhaps they could be part of a budding communications segment at some point down the road, especially as AI is thrown into the mix.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon’s more experimental projects may just put the telecom scene on notice a decade or more from now. Specifically, Amazon’s Project Kuiper, which is shooting to construct a broadband internet network of 3,236 satellites, could be a development to watch closely as Elon Musk’s satellite internet firm Starlink shows signs of early success. For Amazon, Project Kuiper represents a potential threat to traditional telecoms in the future.\n\nWith AMZN stock going for just north of 40 times forward P/E, I not only think such a project is not being baked in to the valuation, but the full potential of its AI-enabled cloud business may not be as well.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?\n\nAMZN stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 42 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average AMZN stock price target of $220.60 implies 20.5% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nAnalysts hold communications stocks in high regard these days. The competitive landscape may be fierce, but with next-generation innovation (think 6G, satellite connectivity, and beyond) and potentially lower rates thrown in, I view the communications market as intriguing. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside in T stock for the year ahead.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) Can Still Rise Despite Sitting at the Top",
        "content": "Numero Uno stock Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a $3 trillion market cap, has delivered a return of around 1,154% over the last decade. Sitting at the top of the global stock markets, will it continue to give similar returns in the next decade? I believe the answer is yes. Microsoft’s consistently strong performance, cloud & AI-driven tailwinds, and robust margins despite substantial AI investments make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll take advantage of any market weakness in the coming months to purchase MSFT.\n\nMicrosoft’s Recent Results Were Strong Yet Again\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft reported impressive Fiscal Q3 results for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all business segments. Q3 adjusted earnings of $2.94 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $2.82 per share. Also, earnings jumped 20% year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.45 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, revenues soared 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion. The Intelligent Cloud business segment, encompassing Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and Windows, among others, grew 23% year-over-year to $26.7 billion, beating expectations yet again. The much-watched segment now comprises 35% of total revenues, with AI playing a significant role as a catalyst driving growth.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of AI by businesses, there is a substantial demand for Microsoft’s Azure and related cloud services. Not surprisingly, Azure and other cloud services witnessed solid revenue growth of 31% (28% in constant currency), significantly surpassing Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nDespite the strong Q3 performance, Microsoft provided a conservative outlook, slightly below expectations. Fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to be $64 billion compared to consensus expectations of $64.5 billion, with Azure revenues expected to grow between 30% and 31%.\n\nOn a positive note, Microsoft offered its FY2025 outlook, anticipating double-digit growth in both revenues and operating income. This forecast reassures investors of the company’s sustained growth trajectory.\n\nAI Will Continue to Act as a Long-Term Catalyst for MSFT\n\nAI has propelled Microsoft to become the largest stock in the world, and it will continue to be the driving force behind its growth story in the coming decade. Microsoft’s early investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT has positioned it ahead of other tech giants.\n\nThe demand for AI remains insatiable, with Microsoft management stating that it exceeds available capacity. This high demand drives continuous heavy investment in AI by Microsoft and other tech titans.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s AI investment plans align with those of its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the space. For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported CAPEX (capital expenditures) of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) spent $6.72 billion. Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Microsoft reported a 22% sequential jump in CAPEX (including finance leases) to $14 billion versus $11.5 billion in the prior quarter. The majority of that amount is assigned to scaling its AI infrastructure and securing processors from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for running large AI models.\n\nIncreasing CAPEX may impact margins. However, Microsoft’s management is taking the initiative to keep costs low and protect margins. For instance, newer and more efficient AI products like GPT-4o and Mai-1 are expected to increase scale and keep costs under control. Furthermore, Mai-1 will compete with major rivals, namely Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nAzure AI Services, which includes AI training and other AI-related services, is experiencing remarkable growth. Azure competes directly with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Google’s cloud business and is closely watched by investors. Notably, Azure AI Services is now estimated to be an over $4 billion run rate business. For comparison (although not a direct comparison), Amazon’s AWS has reached a $100 billion annual run rate. This underscores the substantial opportunity for Azure powered by AI in the coming years.\n\nDuring the earnings call, management confirmed that Azure continues to gain market share, with 65% of Fortune 500 companies using Azure Open AI. There’s a clear acceleration in Azure’s growth, marked by the signing of large deals across several diverse industries, with names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) being added to its clientele. Azure will likely continue to see the growth momentum with increased market share gains in the coming months.\n\nFurther, Microsoft 365 Copilot (AI-backed online assistant) is showing steady adoption. Management stated that 60% of Fortune 500 companies now use the Copilot AI program. The company remains optimistic about its growing contribution to revenues in the coming years.\n\nIt’s not just Azure and Copilot. Microsoft’s AI investments and capabilities are expected to boost revenues and profitability across other product portfolios, such as GitHub, Fabric, and Security.\n\nOn a separate note, MSFT’s acquisition of gaming software rival Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will continue to add to MSFT’s diversified revenue stream. Microsoft recently announced the unveiling of its own mobile store game, equivalent to Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Google’s Play Store.\n\nMicrosoft’s Valuation Isn’t Cheap but Isn’t Expensive Either\n\nDespite being the most valuable stock in the world, Microsoft’s valuation isn’t as expensive as one would think. At first glance, It may look expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37x currently. Nonetheless, I believe the premium is justified, given its favorable industry-leading market position, robust margins, diversified revenue stream, and huge exposure to high-growth AI and cloud businesses.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, online retail and cloud computing giant Amazon is trading at a P/E of 51x, while social networking company Meta Platforms is trading at a 27x P/E.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Microsoft stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the earnings report. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past month. Microsoft stock’s average price target of $491.56 implies 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying MSFT for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm, and Microsoft continues to lead the charge. Microsoft’s early investments in AI have positioned it as a frontrunner in the industry, yielding significant rewards. I believe that Microsoft’s GenAI innovations will continue to drive revenues, profits, and cash flows in the coming years.\n\nWith a long runway for growth and profitability ahead, Microsoft remains a compelling investment. I plan to keep adding MSFT to my portfolio, taking advantage of any market weaknesses in the coming months.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "'Demand is just so strong': Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells Yahoo Finance supply can't keep up",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn't lack demand. What he lacks is supply.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's first quarter earnings report Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\n\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\n\nNvidia is transitioning from its current Hopper AI platform to its more advanced Blackwell system. Ahead of the company's results on Wednesday, some analysts on Wall Street had raised questions about whether some customers would be more cautious with Hopper orders ahead of the more Blackwell units later this year.\n\n\"Hopper demand grew throughout this quarter — after we announced Blackwell — and so that kind of tells you how much demand there is out there,\" Huang said.\n\nHuang added that demand for both platforms will outstrip supply well into next year, with the complexity of these chips also challenging the company's efforts to keep pace.\n\n\"Every component, every part of our data center, is the most complex computer the world's ever made,\" Huang said. \"And so it's sensible that almost everything is constrained.\"\n\nFor the first quarter, Nvidia reported results that topped Wall Street forecasts, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a 461% and 262% jump from the prior year, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income tallied $18.1 billion in the first quarter. Nvidia's quarterly results topped expectations again on Wednesday. (Source: Company Filings)\n\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue to reach $28 billion plus or minus 2%. That’s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected.\n\nThe company also announced a 10-to-1 stock split — in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own — that will go into effect June 10 for shareholders as of June 7.\n\nNvidia also joined its Big Tech peers in boosting its quarterly dividend, with shareholders now set to receive a dividend of $0.10 per share, up from $0.04.\n\nNvidia stock rose as much as 6% in extended trading on Wednesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangs speaks at the company's office in Santa Clara, Calif., April 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nHuang also discussed how Nvidia will navigate the transition from AI training, in which companies train AI models, to AI inferencing, where those same companies deploy models for customers to use.\n\nQuestions have swirled about whether large-scale cloud providers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) would drop Nvidia's chips for inferencing in favor of their own offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Huang sees Nvidia's offerings being just as powerful for inference as they are for training.\n\n\"We have a great position in inference, because inference is just a really complicated problem,\" he said.\n\n\"The software stack is complicated. The type of models that people use is complicated. The vast majority of inferencing today is done on Nvidia. And so, we expect that to continue.\"\n\nThe CEO also touched on the growth the company is seeing in sales to customers beyond major cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, saying that companies ranging from Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) to pharmaceutical firms are increasingly buying up Nvidia chips. In fact, the biggest industry using Nvidia's data-center chip, excluding the cloud companies. is automotive.\n\n\"Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,\" Huang said. \"But every single car, someday we will have to have autonomous capability.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google's AI search overhaul raises 'more questions than answers' for its dominant ad business",
        "content": "By the end of the year more than a billion people around the world will experience a different Google search.\n\nNew generative AI features will give users more complete and direct answers, offering a conversational overview powered by AI technology.\n\nThe transition marks an overhaul of Google’s core search product. And since many people experience the internet through Google, these changes amount to a remaking of how millions use the web and the billions of dollars companies make from them.\n\nGoogle’s transition into an AI-powered answer engine is a bulwark against an emergent AI threat.\n\nIt’s also a strategic gamble: to disrupt the lucrative search ecosystem that Google erected will pay out by making room for an AI-inflected new world order.\n\n“There are still more questions than answers as to how Google's search ad revenues will fare with the introduction of AI Overviews,” said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at eMarketer.\n\nBut OpenAI and Big Tech rivals are surging ahead. They are deploying new AI services as forays against Mountain View’s search empire. For Google to stand by while others push forward poses its own risks.\n\nWhile Google's AI initiatives are designed to improve how internet queries work, many sites that rely upon traditional search results could suffer under a new paradigm. So could Google’s ad-supported search business, the heart of its money-making operation.\n\nThat Google has cemented itself as an everyday verb, the dominant way of tapping into information on the web, speaks to its enduring power as an all-encompassing gatekeeper.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the company's total yearly revenue comes from online advertising. And the search business is a huge part of that. Google commands more than 90% of the market, dwarfing the 4% claimed by rival Microsoft's (MSFT) Bing, according to data from Statcounter.\n\nIn ways both obvious and subtle, if something isn’t discoverable through Google, it may as well not exist. Google claims default status across browsers and devices. And for most people on the internet, Google search is the path of least resistance; there’s too much friction to search for something somewhere else. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai waves at a Google I/O event in Mountain View, Calif., Tuesday, May 14, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat’s what makes Google’s shift to AI-powered search so significant. “The average consumer wasn't going to adapt their search behaviors to generative AI until Google rolled it out,” Mitchell-Wolf said.\n\nAgainst criticisms that Google’s AI push could cannibalize the existing business, executives have likened AI initiatives to other technology shifts that led to growth and new formats and engagement for advertisers. Search, in Google’s view, is more than just a list of blue links, and people turn to the service with their questions, from quick checks to profound explorations.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We have a deep understanding of information needs, and a strong technological foundation, and we continue to rethink what Search can be to serve users in new ways,” Google said in a statement.\n\nThe company is relentlessly data-driven, so it’s likely that internal testing shows that AI overview summarizations lead to different kinds of click-throughs and activity, not necessarily overall less web usage, said John Wihbey, professor of media and technology at Northeastern University.\n\nEarly findings that Google has shared publicly suggest AI Overviews can boost engagement.\n\nAt the Google Marketing Live event on Tuesday, the company said that the links included in AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query. Google also said that people who use AI Overviews use Search more and are more satisfied with their results.\n\nAt least for now, AI Overviews offer a spruced-up version of search advertising.\n\nEchoing Google’s earlier move to place ads at the top of search results, selling prime digital real estate, the company announced on Tuesday that it will begin placing ads in a section labeled “sponsored” within the AI Overview.\n\nRand Fishkin, the CEO of SparkToro, an audience research software company, said Google likely believes two things to be true: that they reduce the risk of disruption or competition from other AI-powered answer engines by implementing their own; and they view the risks to their core, paid advertising business as relatively light, or even nonexistent.\n\nIt could be that AI Overview features don’t impact paid search volume negatively, perhaps because they rarely interfere with the average number of clicks on paid results, he said. Or they have a positive effect on the average number of searches that people engage in, negating any drop in ad clicks.\n\nIn a less flattering light, Google’s AI efforts resemble a desperate scramble.\n\nScott Jenson, a former Google employee who left the company last month, said the AI projects he was working on “were poorly motivated and driven by this panic that as long as it had ‘AI’ in it, it would be great.” In a post on LinkedIn earlier this week, he said the company’s shortsighted approach wasn’t fueled by user needs, but by “a stone cold panic that they are getting left behind.”\n\nBut what some critics view as a clumsy, reactionary posture, others describe as an urgent defense.\n\nIf AI models are the next platform, akin to the transition to mobile phones and apps, Google can't afford to miss out.\n\nAnother way to think about Google’s approach is to recall the early days of social media and other burgeoning but now established tech platforms. Their sales pitch to the market was based on growth. At least for a time, amassing users and staking out territory were more important than making money.\n\n“Any time a consumer opts for another search destination, that's a missed opportunity for Google,” said Mitchell-Wolf. “If it's left behind in the AI-generated search race and consumers end up preferring AI-led search experiences, there will be fewer queries for it to monetize. How monetization will happen is secondary to whether it can happen at all.\"\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Big Tech employees missed out on $5.1 billion in 401(k) gains over the last decade because of fossil fuels, new research finds",
        "content": "Do you know how your 401(k) funds are invested—the kind of companies they hold, and what those companies are doing to respond to urgent global risks like climate change? There’s a good chance that, like almost half of workers, you don’t. You hand your contributions over to the plan, which puts them in whatever investments your employer and their fund manager have picked.\n\nThen you sit back and hope your balance grows. Whether it does, and how much, depends on where those fund managers are putting your money. Since default allocations and target date funds are how most people’s 401(k) funds get invested, it’s imperative that they reflect the financial interests of employee-investors like you.\n\nBig Tech companies have tens of billions of employee 401(k) funds invested. One of the easiest ways they can help their employees’ money grow faster is to switch their default option to a sustainable fund and stop putting it into fossil fuel companies—which will help protect the climate, too.\n\nNew research conducted at the University of Waterloo (Canada) in partnership with the shareholder organization I lead, As You Sow, looked at the 401(k) plans of 12 tech-sector companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Netflix. It found that 2 million tech workers could have earned an estimated $5.1 billion in additional returns if their employers had pulled their retirement plan holdings out of fossil fuels a decade ago. Google employees alone lost out on an estimated $1.1 billion in gains. On average, investments in fossil-free portfolios did 8.9% better over 10 years. Compound that over an employee’s whole career—and it's big money.\n\nThat’s because, as the global economy rapidly transitions to renewable energy, fossil fuels are an objectively risky investment compared to the market overall. And the risk is accelerating: One study suggests that half of the world’s fossil fuel assets could be worthless by 2036.\n\nThe amount of employees’ money that Big Tech 401(k) plans have invested in fossil fuels, especially through target date funds, is stunning. Google employees are believed to have roughly $2 billion in fossil fuels. Apple employees to have another billion. The bulk of this money is invested not by choice but by default, through target date funds. Moving it out of risky fossil fuel investments into safer, future-forward assets is the best choice for employees and it aligns with these companies’ stated sustainability goals.\n\nAs You Sow presented these findings to the 12 companies prior to the public release of the study. None of the companies offered a substantive response. However, it’s also not the first time they’ve learned that their 401(k) plans are out of alignment with their publicly stated climate commitments. In fact, As You Sow has previously met with senior management and filed shareholder resolutions over several years, raising the issue at several of the companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo why aren’t Big Tech companies fixing the problem? It’s particularly puzzling given that they’ve all implemented their climate goals in their operations. Google markets its “third decade of climate action” on its main landing page, and clearly states on its sustainability landing page that it is critical to “track our progress and be transparent with what we’ve accomplished and where we’re going.” Amazon encourages consumers to “discover and shop for more sustainable products” as part of its “Climate Pledge Friendly” program. Apple’s 2030 plan commits to using “recycled and renewable materials, clean electricity, and low-carbon shipping” to bring its net emissions to zero. Yet, their employee retirement plans are counteracting those efforts while also resulting in lower returns.\n\nAddressing the systemic risk of investing in high-carbon companies is a proven win-win strategy for companies looking to reduce their emissions while protecting their employees from climate-related financial risk. Big Tech companies could do it with one call to Vanguard or BlackRock telling them to provide fossil-free default investment funds for their employees’ money.\n\nThat one phone call would change the face of 401(k) investing. It would be a substantive step toward climate change mitigation and would earn employees better investment returns for retirement. It would send the global business community a message that fulfilling their fiduciary duty to choose the funds with the greatest long-term sustainable growth potential is not hard. It will protect employees from climate-related financial risk, demonstrate that the company applies its sustainability goals holistically, create a positive culture that attracts and retains the best and brightest employees, and build customer loyalty.\n\nAndrew Behar is the CEO of As You Sow.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nFannie Mae CEO: Beyoncé is right.

The lead into the fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings call is just as busy, but this year Nvidia is being mentioned in rooms even when they aren't physically present as conference participants.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nWall Street Horizon has found that while a standalone event such as a company's upcoming earnings release date may affect volatility, investigating multiple events closely in relationship to one another can have a stronger impact on a company's corporate financial health. Observing the information pre-event, during the event and post-event and how they interact is critical to understand how events relate to trading and risk strategies. Currently we see a notable event cluster lining up for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is working the May conferencecircuit - Whether in attendance or not\n\nNot only has Nvidia been busy as participants on the May conference circuit, speaking at the RSA Cybersecurity Conference in San Francisco on May 6-9, as well as the Macquarie Asia Conference on May 13 in Hong Kong, but they are being praised at other highly watched AI events where they aren't even necessarily in attendance.\n\nAt the onset of the AI event cluster last week, OpenAI demoed their latest update of their generative AI product for consumers, GPT - 4o, on Monday, May 13. Their chief technology officer, Mira Murati, thanked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for bringing us the most advanced chips to make that presentation possible.[1]\n\nThen on Tuesday, May 14, Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) held their annual developer conference. At that event, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also gave Nvidia a shoutout. He referenced their longstanding partnership and revealed that Google Cloud will begin using the chipmaker's Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) in early 2025.[2]\n\nMay 21-23 - Microsoft Build 2024 (Redmond, WA)This week, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds its annual Build conference in Redmond, Washington from May 21 - 23. Nvidia again will be at the center of attention as MSFT provides servers to OpenAI and is expected to announce the latest updates to its AI suite which utilizes Nvidia's GPUs.[3] Many of Nvidia's top talent are featured speakers at the event, including Adel El Hallak, senior director of Product Management for Enterprise AI, Ganesh Sivaraman, director of Omniverse Partnerships, and Jesse Clayton, director of Product Management and Product Marketing, Windows AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nMay 22 - Fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings report and conference call (2:00PM PT)This will all be taking place as Nvidia readies itself to report first-quarter earnings later today, with a webcast to follow at 5:00PM ET. According to FactSet data, they are expected to post bottom-line growth of 414% and revenue growth of 242%, making it one of the biggest contributors to S&P 500 growth this season.\n\nJune 26 - Annual shareholder meeting (9:00AM PT, Virtual)The frenzy of events will come to a close on June 26 when Nvidia holds its annual shareholder meeting, another chance for investors to get important updates on the company. The meeting will be held virtually at 9:00AM PT.\n\nConference season mostly wraps up ahead of summer break in July and August. After their shareholder meeting, the next time we are likely to hear an update from Nvidia is on their fiscal second-quarter 2025 earnings call on Aug. 21 (projected date).\n\n1 OpenAI gave Jensen Huang a shout-out at the GPT-4o launch in a nod to Nvidia's huge influence on AI, Business Insider, May 14, 2024, https://www.businessinsider.com2 Google I/O Highlights: Unpacking Gemini Updates and AI Overviews, CNET, May 15, 2024, https://www.cnet.com3 Microsoft and NVIDIA Announce Major Integrations to Accelerate Generative AI for Enterprises Everywhere, March 18, 2024, https://nvidianews.nvidia.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Alphabet (GOOGL)",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this internet search leader a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.6%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.1%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 12.2% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlphabet has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Alphabet well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia Is the Final Hurdle for Mega Tech’s Earnings Victory Lap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A surprisingly strong earnings season for big tech reaches its grand finale Wednesday afternoon when Nvidia Corp., the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant, reports its results and gives a much anticipated outlook that could set the tone for the second half of the year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Flight Routes Suffer the World’s Worst Turbulence One Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence ‘It Felt Like We Had Crashed’: Singapore Air Passenger Describes Turbulence Terror Barclays Managers Warn Some Staff to Prepare for Five Days a Week in Office\n\nInvestors were nervous as technology companies started reporting, with questions about whether the AI boom had run too far and if the group could meet the lofty expectations set for it. A month later, most of those concerns have been put to rest with the S&P 500 Index sitting at an all-time high on the back of strong corporate profits.\n\nSo, Nvidia arrives with the expectation that it will confirm the enthusiasm — and potentially offer a glimpse into the future for stocks. The company’s shares have been on a rocket ride since its blow-out fiscal fourth-quarter results and outlook a year ago, soaring 212% and adding roughly $1.5 trillion in market value in the past 12 months. With a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion, Nvidia’s weighting in the S&P 500 is more than 5%, up from 2.2% a year ago.\n\nNvidia shares slipped about 1% in early trading on Wednesday, after closing at a record the day before.\n\n“It is the leader, and if the demand remains strong in Nvidia then you know that means demand is going to be strong across the board,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. “That will dictate not only the next leg in the AI-deemed stocks in the semiconductor space, but it could dictate the market.”\n\nThe AI Chip Behind Nvidia’s Supersonic Stock Rally: QuickTake\n\nMagnificent Seven Rides\n\nAn index that tracks seven of the biggest US technology stocks is at a record high after earnings from the likes of Microsoft Corp., Google-parent Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. showed that demand for AI services is helping to fuel revenue growth. Alphabet has rallied 13% since beating first-quarter sales estimates and initiating a dividend last month. And Apple Inc., whose shares had slumped as much as 14% this year, is close to turning positive for the year after its strong results.\n\n“The market has gotten a lot of what it’s wanted this earnings season,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer of Ladenburg Asset Management and chief market strategist at its parent Osaic Holdings Inc. “Nvidia is sort of icing on the cake.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter four-consecutive quarters of Nvidia earnings that have blown past Wall Street estimates, investors have come to expect a repeat performance. What’s less certain is how the shares will respond. The stock has gained 0.1%, lost 2.5% and jumped 16% following the company’s last three reports. With an implied day-after-earnings move of about 8%, it’s a high stakes event for the entire market.\n\nNvidia shares tumbled 10% on April 19, their worst day since March 2020, as investors seemed to grow skeptical of the AI boom. But subsequent earnings reports from Alphabet, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc. showed how much companies are planning to spend on computing infrastructure. That helped propel the stock to a record close on Tuesday.\n\n“The demand is still outstripping the supply,” said Mike Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management. “You can always have an overreaction to the upside and downside in the short term, but fundamentals for the business have not changed.”\n\nFading Enthusiasm\n\nStill, there are signs that the exuberance is starting to fade. In the options market, the premium for Nvidia calls over puts has disappeared in the past two months, an indication that investors are “hesitant to take long positions ahead of the report,” said Stuart Kaiser, head of equity trading strategy at Citigroup.\n\nTo that point, the debate is less about whether Nvidia will top expectations than about how much of a beat is needed for the stock to rally. To avoid a selloff, the company will have to top profit and sales estimates by at least 15%, said David Miller, senior portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds.\n\nIn its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia is projected to deliver earnings of $13.2 billion on sales of $24.7 billion, up 544% and 243%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nNvidia has beaten its revenue forecast by about $2 billion in each of the past two quarters, and Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore expect a similar performance this time. However, the rollout of a new chip dubbed Blackwell later this year has some investors concerned that customers could slow purchases of its predecessor until the new one is available.\n\n“For now our checks continue to point to strong, steady growth even as we transition to Blackwell,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, there’s also the normal cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, where sales booms can be followed by lulls as customers digest their inventory.\n\n“There’s going to be that day where we hit an air pocket,” said Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. “I don’t know if it’s this quarter, next quarter, next year or 10 years from now, but I know that these sales, you know, you tend to build ahead of things and then you pause.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple shares wavered in early trading on Wednesday, but are on track to notch their longest winning streak since 2022 if they’re able to recapture gains.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nBritish personal computer maker Raspberry Pi confirmed its plan for an initial public offering in London, marking a small step for the city that’s fallen behind a broader listings revival in Europe. Paytm warned of job cuts and said it would trim non-core assets after reporting its first sales decline on record, reflecting fallout from a regulatory probe that curtailed much of the Indian fintech pioneer’s business. Apple Inc. plans to ask a court to throw out the Justice Department’s antitrust case against the iPhone maker, making a long-shot bid to ward off what promises to be a lengthly legal battle. Snowflake Inc.’s talks to acquire startup Reka AI for more than $1 billion have broken down, dashing an effort by the software company to bring more generative AI muscle in-house. Sonos Inc. is entering the headphone market with a $449 device, part of an effort to turn the home-speaker company into a broader maker of consumer technology.\n\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna.\n\n(Updates stock moves at market open, adds Tech Chart of the Day)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Nvidia stock retreats from record high ahead of crucial first quarter earnings report",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock retreated from a record high on Wednesday ahead of its first quarter earnings report set for release after the bell. The report is expected to be one of the most consequential for investors this year, as Nvidia has been at the center of the AI boom driving markets over the last 18 months.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to report revenue and profits that rose more than 200% and 400%, respectively, from the prior-year period as the company experiences a surge in demand for its chips amid the AI boom.\n\nAnalysts expect adjusted earnings per share to total $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nNvidia stock has been on a tear over the last year, rising over 200% and closing at a record high on Tuesday. The stock has risen nearly 700% since the stock market lows in October 2022. Shares were off around 0.4% in early trade on Tuesday.\n\nThe vast majority of Nvidia's revenue will come from its Data Center business, which is set to pull in $21 billion, up from $4.28 billion in Q1 last year.\n\nThe company’s Gaming division, formerly its largest segment, is expected to see revenue of $3.5 billion, up from $2.24 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nAhead of Nvidia’s earnings announcement, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on the company’s share price to $1,085 from $910, saying that he anticipates Nvidia will once again beat expectations on the top and bottom lines and raise its guidance for the next quarter.\n\nDemand for its chips from hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and others has boosted the company's results, making Wednesday's report a key check on the industry's appetite for further AI investment.\n\nAnd as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, the AI trade has moved beyond the borders of tech, with investors looking to energy and power companies as derivative plays on the AI boom.\n\nBut Roy, like analysts at BofA Global Research and Loop Capital, says there remain near-term concerns about how much the transition from Nvidia’s current Hopper line of AI chips to its Blackwell line will impact overall sales.\n\nThe fear is that customers will put some of their orders for Hopper chips on hold while they wait for Nvidia to roll out its more powerful Blackwell products. On Tuesday, Amazon said it had transitioned an upcoming supercomputer project to Blackwell chips after a report from The Financial Times suggested the retail giant had paused some chip orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nLoop Capital’s Ananda Baruah argued it's possible Nvidia won't let companies put their Hopper orders on hold without losing their place in line to purchase Blackwell chips. If enough customers put their orders on hold in favor of Blackwell chips, Nvidia could see a temporary dip in quarter-over-quarter sales. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang displays products onstage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia is also contending with the threat of its customers building their own in-house AI chips.\n\nSo far Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are using — or are working toward — their own AI chips that provide better power efficiency than Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nThat doesn’t mean those companies will completely abandon Nvidia’s chips, though the push to their own products could cut into the chip giant’s market share. AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are gaining steam when it comes to their own AI chips.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft announced during its Build conference that it would begin offering AMD’s MI300X chips for developers looking to train and deploy AI models. The Windows maker also made sure, however, to point out that it is using Nvidia’s chips as well. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about the importance of The Dow Jones Industrial Average touching the 40,000 mark for the first time ever. Cramer said that the Dow hitting its new highs was a \"team effort\" with stocks from many different sectors adding to the index's gains, instead of just the gains from major tech stocks with size and growth similar to the likes of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nCramer said that many of the Dow stocks should have been \"hurt\" by the consistent rate hikes by the Fed.\n\n\"They should have been crushed by the inflationary spiral. They should have been annihilated by supply chain problems during COVID. None of that happened.\"\n\nCramer Doesn't See \"Anything\" Like 2008 Crisis Happening\n\nCramer said that it's been almost 20 years since the 2008 financial crisis. Cramer said when he \"surveys\" today's market \"landscape\" he sees the situation totally different from what it was back then.\n\n\"I just don’t see anything like that happening.\"\n\nCramer said that many people would argue that no one saw the 2008 financial crisis coming, but in fact there were many who were warning about the impending collapse, including him.\n\nJim Cramer said that back in 2007 he was \"screaming\" about the \"danger.\"\n\nCramer Laments Over Negativity in the Market\n\nCramer lamented that younger investors from millennials and Generation Z have grown to be pessimists when it comes to the stock market. He wondered whether its his \"job\" to celebrate the Dow hitting 40,000 to infuse some positivity in the market. Cramer said his generation (the Baby Boomers) believed that they were better off when compared to their previous generation financially and had a positive attitude in the stock market.\n\nJim Cramer wondered what's wrong with celebrating when stocks go high.\n\n\"We have so much negativity that surrounds us. We are drowning in it. All of a sudden something positive falls into our lap, a major milestone… does it make sense to scoff at it?\" Cramer said.\n\n\"I'm Not Asking for Champagnes or Trophies\"\n\nThe CNBC host said he's not asking for \"champagnes\" or \"trophies\" to celebrate the Dow's new milestone. What Cramer wants is the rejection of \"nihilism\" and skepticism that's prevailing in the market. Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks\n\nJim Cramer recommended several stocks in his latest programs aired on CNBC.

        "title": "Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Alphabet fair value estimate is US$216 Alphabet's US$178 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$191 analyst price target for GOOGL is 12% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$80.4b US$92.1b US$107.0b US$114.0b US$129.5b US$140.2b US$149.3b US$157.1b US$164.0b US$170.2b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x17 Analyst x18 Analyst x10 Analyst x3 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.25% Est @ 6.49% Est @ 5.26% Est @ 4.39% Est @ 3.79% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$75.0k US$80.2k US$86.8k US$86.3k US$91.5k US$92.4k US$91.8k US$90.1k US$87.8k US$85.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$867b\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$170b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.4%) = US$3.6t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.6t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.8t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.7t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$178, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.046. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Alphabet\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings, revenue expected to surge first quarter as AI trade faces latest test",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is set report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday in what will be one of the most consequential reports for investors this year.\n\nWall Street is expecting Nvidia to report revenue and profits that rose more than 200% and 400%, respectively, from the prior year period as the company experiences a surge in demand for its chips amid the AI boom.\n\nAnalysts expect adjusted earnings per share to total $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nNvidia stock has been on a tear over the last year, rising over 200%. The stock has risen nearly 700% since the stock market lows in October 2022.\n\nThe vast majority of Nvidia's revenue will come from its Data Center business, which is set to pull in $21 billion, up from $4.28 billion in Q1 last year.\n\nThe company’s Gaming division, formerly its largest segment, is expected to see revenue of $3.5 billion, up from $2.24 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nAhead of Nvidia’s earnings announcement, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on the company’s share price to $1,085 from $910, saying that he anticipates Nvidia will once again beat expectations on the top and bottom line and raise its guidance for the next quarter.\n\nDemand for its chips from hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and others has boosted the company's results, making Wednesday's report a key check on the industry's appetite for further AI investment.\n\nAnd as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, the AI trade has moved beyond the borders of tech, with investors looking to energy and power companies as derivative plays on the AI boom.\n\nBut Roy, like analysts at BofA Global Research and Loop Capital, says there remain near-term concerns about how much the transition from Nvidia’s current Hopper line of AI chips to its Blackwell line will impact overall sales.\n\nThe fear is that customers will put some of their orders for Hopper chips on hold while they wait for Nvidia to roll out its more powerful Blackwell products. The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Amazon had paused some orders from Nvidia as it waits for more advanced Blackwell chips to be made available.\n\nLoop Capital’s Ananda Baruah argued it's possible Nvidia won't let companies put their Hopper orders on hold without losing their place in line to purchase Blackwell chips. If enough customers put their orders on hold in favor of Blackwell chips, Nvidia could see a temporary dip in quarter-over-quarter sales.\n\nStory continues NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang displays products on-stage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, California, on March 18, 2024. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia is also contending with the threat of its customers building their own in-house AI chips.\n\nSo far Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are using — or are working toward — their own AI chips that provide better power efficiency than Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nThat doesn’t mean those companies will completely abandon Nvidia’s chips, though the push to their own products could cut into the chip giant’s market share. AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are gaining steam when it comes to their own AI chips.\n\nOn Tuesday, for instance, Microsoft announced it will begin offering AMD’s MI300X chips for developers looking to train and deploy AI models during its Build conference. The Windows maker also made sure, however, to point out that it is using Nvidia’s chips as well. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. plans to ask a court to throw out the Justice Department’s antitrust case against the iPhone maker, making a long-shot bid to ward off what promises to be a lengthly legal battle.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence ASML, TSMC Can Disable Chip Machines If China Invades Taiwan Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Tesla Shareholder Group Slams Elon Musk’s $56 Billion Pay Package Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is ‘Well on the Way’\n\nLawyers representing the company sent a letter to the judge overseeing the case in New Jersey outlining the arguments it will include when it files a formal motion to dismiss the lawsuit next month. The company said in the letter that the government’s complaint doesn’t allege anticompetitive conduct, substantial anticompetitive effects or monopoly power in a relevant market.\n\n“This court should reject the invitation to forge a new theory of antitrust liability that no court has recognized, that would harm innovation, and that would only deprive consumers of the key competitive features that make iPhone distinctive,” Apple wrote in its filing.\n\nThe US government is due to respond to Apple’s letter by May 30, while the court’s ruling on the formal motion to dismiss is due either later in 2024 or early next year. If the case ultimately goes to trial, proceedings likely wouldn’t occur for at least a few years.\n\nRead More: Justice Department Risks Picking the Wrong Fight With Apple\n\nMotions to dismiss are commonly filed in antitrust cases, though rarely granted in government lawsuits. Alphabet Inc.’s Google filed one in the Justice Department case concerning its advertising technology business, but failed to get the case tossed out.\n\nBy contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. successfully persuaded a federal judge to dismiss a Federal Trade Commission complaint by arguing that the agency didn’t provide enough evidence that the company had a monopoly in social networking. The FTC subsequently filed an amended complaint that the judge allowed to move forward.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Apple in March, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals and app developers from accessing key hardware and software features. The complaint marked the conclusion of a half-decade probe into Apple and followed moves by other regions, including the European Union, to rein in Apple’s power.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its control over app distribution to thwart innovation and make it harder for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This case is about freeing smartphone markets from Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future,” according to the suit, which seeks changes to Apple’s practices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "What Nvidia says about AI chip demand could matter for more than just the tech trade",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence enthusiasm has been spreading across the stock market.\n\nWednesday night's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings call will mark a year since the chipmaker first shocked Wall Street with its demand for AI chips. Since then, mentions of AI have skyrocketed on earnings calls, growing 186% since the first quarter of 2023, per Bank of America Research.\n\nThis comes as the conversation around AI has quickly moved from AI chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) to AI power users like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). More recently, strategists have highlighted a broadening out to other sectors that could benefit from the increased power usage, like Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), and Commodities.\n\n\"It's not just about NVDA anymore,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nThis shift has already been underway in the market. Several precious metals, including copper (HG=F), which strategists have said will benefit from AI spend, have hit recent highs. The Utilities and Energy sectors are two of the top-performing sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this year, up about 15% and 13%, respectively.\n\nThis has trickled down to individual names that are now rivaling the meteoric stock rise of Nvidia since the start of 2024. Texas-based Vistra Corp (VST) is up roughly 140% this year, while Constellation Energy (CEG) shares have risen nearly 90%, which is about in line with Nvidia's rise this year.\n\nIn a note on Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson listed Utilities as an Overweight sector, noting it offers \"upside to the AI power theme.\" Wilson highlighted that the Power and Utilities team at Morgan Stanley believes electricity could rise from 3% of total US consumption in 2023 to about 10% by 2030, driven by new AI data centers that are 50 times the size of previous ones.\n\n\"Both traditional and alternative energy providers have upside revisions potential amid the increasing need for AI data center power and more favorable data center power deals,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nAnd companies have been playing up their role in the AI buildout too.\n\nResearch from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter. More than 66% of companies in the Energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.\n\nGiven the big-picture implications, investors will be closely watching Nvidia's report for color on AI chip demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus far, Nvidia has repeatedly surprised investors on this front, continuously topping analyst expectations for quarterly results and boosting its outlook for the coming quarter amid robust demand for its AI servers.\n\nWhether this trend holds or breaks could now have repercussions for a variety of sectors.\n\n\"If markets wake up to say, 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit,' and that's reflected in those valuations,\"' JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley told Yahoo Finance, \"that's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\" Nvidia Corporation logo is displayed on a smartphone screen, with a graphic representation of the stock market in the background.

        "content": "Comcast (CMCSA) revealed the price of its recently announced StreamSaver bundle, which will package Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier (NFLX) and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\n\nThe new offering, available to Comcast’s broadband internet and TV subscribers, will launch next week at a price point of $15 a month, yielding savings of around 35% compared to the cost of subscribing to the three services separately, Comcast said.\n\nCustomers can also access Netflix and Apple TV+ subscriptions through Comcast's Now TV streaming platform, which includes Peacock and 40 other channels, for $30 a month (as opposed to $20 a month without the additional services.)\n\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\nOn average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. Streamers have found it difficult to retain subscribers over the longterm.\n\n\"One of the biggest issues the industry has faced is serial churners,\" Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley told Yahoo Finance. \"Even for the top platforms like Netflix, churn is still a very real problem. ... Bundling is a big effort to try to mitigate that.\"\n\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.\n\nDisney (DIS), which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year.\n\nThe move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney announced a new streaming bundle that will combine Disney+, Hulu, and Max, with a launch date set for this summer in the US. In December, WBD partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon (VZ).\n\nAnd earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall. Last week, the companies announced its name: Venu.\n\nStory continues Comcast revealed the price of its recently announced StreamSaver bundle, which will package Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier and Apple TV+.

        "title": "Microsoft unveils GPT-4o for Azure, new AI apps in fight against Google, Amazon",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday debuted a host of new AI features during its Build conference in Seattle, including OpenAI’s new GPT-4o, a trio of small language models, and Microsoft’s new Cobalt 100 CPU.\n\nThe announcements come as Silicon Valley turbocharges its AI investments and tech giants like Microsoft, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) race to outmaneuver one another during the biggest tech scramble in years.\n\nMicrosoft offering OpenAI’s GPT-4o through its Azure AI Studio was the company's biggest announcement on Tuesday.\n\nThe model, which OpenAI debuted during a live-streamed event last week, is multimodal and can understand inputs via text, audio, and video. That demo has since become embroiled in controversy after actress Scarlett Johansson on Monday demanded the company change the voice of its chatbot, which OpenAI featured answering questions.\n\nMicrosoft’s news also comes a week after Google debuted a slew of AI products during its I/O developers conference, including a new version of Google Search with generative AI-based responses to users’ queries. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during an event titled \"Microsoft Build: AI Day\" in Jakarta, Indonesia, Tuesday, April 30, 2024. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMicrosoft said users will now be able to develop their own copilots — essentially AI-powered programs — using GPT-4o to make apps that can respond to images, voice, and text. The Windows maker also said it will make its preview of Copilot in Azure available to all customers in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMicrosoft also showed off its Phi-3-small, Phi-3-medium, and Phi-3-vision small language models. Designed to run on devices, the Phi-3 models don’t need to connect to the web, allowing users to access them in environments where they otherwise wouldn’t be able to run cloud-based models like GPT-4o.\n\nPhi-3-vision is especially interesting, as it allows users to input images and text and then receive information about them via text outputs. So, for example, users will be able to do things like ask questions about charts, graphs, or images without needing to jump online.\n\nMicrosoft 365 is also getting copilot upgrades, with Copilot for Microsoft 365’s new Team Copilot. The app, Microsoft says, can manage meeting agendas and take notes, summarize Teams chats and answer questions related to those conversations. The app can also track user deadlines and notify individual team members when they need to take action.\n\nIn addition to new software and developer capabilities, Microsoft also said it will begin previewing Azure virtual machines running on the company’s new Arm-based Cobalt 100 cloud CPUs.\n\nVirtual machines are basically software-simulated versions of computers. So, instead of having to run 50 individual desktops, you can run 50 virtual machines on a high-powered server.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft claims that its Cobalt 100 chip provides 40% better performance than prior ARM-based virtual machine systems. In addition to the Cobalt 100 CPU, the company says it will begin offering AMD’s (AMD) MI300X chip for developers looking to train and deploy AI apps.\n\nAll of this is part of Microsoft’s effort to continue growing its cloud business through AI apps. Google and Amazon are using a similar strategy to expand their respective cloud empires as well, but Microsoft's multibillion-dollar investment in partner OpenAI has helped catapult the company to the top of the AI discussion.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Microsoft said its AI products contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter.\n\nA year ago, Microsoft first broke out its AI percentage contributions to Azure, saying it added 1 percentage point to Azure revenue at the time.

Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had said in his 2000 letter to investors that while value investing might underperform the broader market amid changing investment sentiment, value investing as a basic investment principle and strategy would never go out of style.\n\n\"We are not seeking to keep up with any particular market index or benchmark. Rather, we are attempting to achieve good risk-adjusted investment results over time through the successful implementation of our investment philosophy. We continue to believe strongly in a value investment approach, attempting to buy assets or businesses at a considerable discount to underlying value. Bargains exist because the financial markets are inefficient, yet many investors lack the requisite patience and discipline to take advantage of them. A value approach may outperform or underperform the overall market at various times because of changing investor sentiment, but we believe that a value philosophy never goes out of style. When sentiment towards undervalued sectors of the market is at its nadir, it is the best time to be buying value.\"\n\nSeth Klarman is Investing in AI, Growth Stocks in 2024\n\nA cursory glance at Seth Klarman's Q1'2024 portfolio shows that the value investor is no longer limiting himself to defensive stocks with attractive valuation metrics. He's investing in some high-growth, loss-making companies as well which are expected to grow in the future. Klarman has time and again said that value investing does not mean adhering to a set pattern without any flexibility.\n\nWhat Makes a Stock Undervalued According to Klarman?\n\nIn his 2000 letter he said that he'd consider a stock undervalued if its undervaluation is \"substantial\" and there are enough catalysts to help it reach its true value in the future. Klarman also said the underlying business of the company he'd like to investing should be \"growing, not eroding.\"\n\nSeth Klarman wrote \"Margin of Safety\" back in 1991. The book, just like Klarman's investments, aged well, and after years of gaining no attention from the Wall Street, became a value investing bible and cult classic in the investing landscape. Talking about his book and investing philosophy on Capital Allocators with Ted Seides last year, Klarman said any piece of financial writing or advice should stand the test of time. He gave the example of  Security Analysis written by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, saying the companies and case studies mentioned in the book are no more, but the principles and strategies continue to stay relevant. Klarman thinks even if humans are replaced by computers, these timeless investing principles will stay valid.\n\nStory continues\n\nKlarman also said chances of making money by investing in \"widely-followed\" stocks are not that high.\n\n\"Looking at what everybody else is looking at is probably not that interesting. If you are doing to look at what everybody else looks at, look at it in a highly differentiated way. But you are not going to make money by outsmarting people on widely followed stocks with an undifferentiated opinion.\" Seth Klarman Portfolio 2024\n\nBaupost Group Returns\n\nThe media-shy billionaire, worth about $1.3 billion, founded Baupost Group in 1982. While the fund doesn’t publicly share its returns, a Wall Street Journal report last year disclosed that Baupost has returned on average about 20% annually since its inception.\n\nFor this article we scanned Klarman's Q1'2024 portfolio and chose three exciting stocks he bought new stakes in during the first quarter. Unlike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), which everyone is buying, you will see some new names in the portfolio.

(NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $5,554,000\n\nValue investor Seth Klarman piling into a high-growth AI stock that has run more than 163% so far this year is news in its own. SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a California-based AI voice and speech recognition solutions company that came to the limelight following the AI revolution after the launch of ChatGPT. Seth Klarman's Baupost reported owning a $5,554,000 stake in SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) during the first quarter of 2024. In addition to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), AI-focused investors are also buying SOUN.\n\nFortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $12,194,000\n\nHealthcare solutions company Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) is one of the stocks Seth Klarman is buying in 2024. His hedge fund Baupost opened a $12,194,000 stake in Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) during the March quarter this year.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of 2023, 31 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE).\n\nIn May Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) posted Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at -$0.04, missing estimates by $0.04. Revenue fell 4.6% year over year to $662.1 million, missing estimates by $92.48 million.\n\nUnlike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), FTRE is a small company with low hedge fund sentiment.\n\nVltava Fund mentioned Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“Value can be created in various ways. Acquisition is one possibility. So-called spin-offs represent another. This involves hiving off a part of a company into a separate entity and taking it to market. One such spin-off occurred last summer with LabCorp. It spun off a smaller part of the company under the name Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE). For each of their shares, LabCorp shareholders received one share of the new Fortrea. It started trading at a fairly attractive price, so we sold immediately. Considering the price we got, we could say that this spin-off brought us some value, but it was only a one-off transaction and not a very large one at that.”\n\nGDS Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GDS)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $17,290,000\n\nChina-based data center company GDS Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GDS) is another growth stock Seth Klarman bought in the first three months of 2024.

        "title": "Here's Why Alphabet (GOOGL) is a Strong Growth Stock",
        "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nFor growth investors, a company's financial strength, overall health, and future outlook take precedence, so they'll want to zero in on the Growth Style Score. This Score examines things like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will generate sustainable growth over time.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nGOOGL sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), holds a Growth Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of B. Earnings and sales are forecasted to increase 31.2% and 15.2% year-over-year, respectively.\n\n17 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.84 to $7.61 per share for 2024. GOOGL boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.3%.\n\nAlphabet is also cash rich. The company has generated cash flow growth of 15.1%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 16.7% in 2024.\n\nWith solid fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, GOOGL should be on investors' short lists.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 13.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $178.77 in the previous session. Alphabet has gained 26.7% since the start of the year compared to the 16.9% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 22.6% return for the Zacks Internet - Services industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2024, Alphabet reported EPS of $1.89 versus consensus estimate of $1.49 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.35%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $7.61 per share on $295.53 billion in revenues. This represents a 31.21% change in EPS on a 15.21% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.65 per share on $329.71 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.68% and 11.57%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nAlphabet may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nAlphabet has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 23.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 25.7X versus its peer group's average of 11.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Alphabet meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Alphabet shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nHow Does GOOGL Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of GOOGL have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Dropbox, Inc. (DBX). DBX has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of C.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Dropbox, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 18.37%, and for the current fiscal year, DBX is expected to post earnings of $2.05 per share on revenue of $2.54 billion.\n\nShares of Dropbox, Inc. have gained 2.5% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 11.67X and a P/CF of 13.35X.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is in the top 28% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GOOGL and DBX, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Holistic AI Is Now H, a New French Startup With $220 Million Out of the Gate",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A French artificial intelligence startup, simply called H, has raised $220 million in initial financing from a slew of billionaires and venture capitalists on the promise of building the next generation of powerful AI tools.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence ASML and TSMC Can Disable Chip Machines If China Invades Taiwan Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is ‘Well on the Way’ Iran State TV Says ‘No Sign of Life’ at Helicopter Crash Site\n\nFor months, a group of French scientists who worked at Google DeepMind have been quietly pitching investors on their project, which they had called Holistic AI. The startup announced its new name on Tuesday and said it would produce models capable of reasoning, planning and performing complex tasks.\n\nBillionaires Bernard Arnault — who invested through his fund Aglaé Ventures — Eric Schmidt, Xavier Niel and Yuri Milner took part in the round along with Accel Partners LP, Amazon.com Inc., Samsung and enterprise software firm UiPath Inc.\n\nCharles Kantor, the startup’s chief executive officer and a former computational mathematics student at Stanford University, said the company is working toward “full-AGI” — referencing a type of superhuman AI that can be deployed across a wide range of tasks, which DeepMind-owner Alphabet Inc. and OpenAI have also said they’re striving for. H’s other co-founders are veteran engineers from Google DeepMind, who worked on some of the AI lab’s seminal research.\n\n“The H team’s vision of creating a large action model to automate business tasks has the ability to be transformational across all industries,” Philippe Botteri, a partner at Accel, said in a statement.\n\nFrance has become a hotbed of AI in Europe, drawing in investments from US venture capitalists and tech giants. Parisian startup Mistral AI raised more than $500 million since forming in early 2023. Mistral develops large-language models, like OpenAI’s GPT and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, that power AI chatbots and image-generators. Bpifrance, which backed Mistral, is also investing in H. As are a number of French venture firms, including Elaia Partners and Motier Ventures.\n\nThe newest French entrant is arriving in a crowded field. Several startups are working on AI agents — systems that perform range of tasks without human supervision and accomplish things that existing AI models can’t. Some companies are already using these agents to help with employee on-boarding and managing supply chains. Google, Microsoft and OpenAI are all working this “agentic” AI, which many in the industry have described as the next step in the field.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile courting investors, the founders of H highlighted their technical expertise in developing “multi-agent” AI — systems that interact and learn from their environment and each other. So far, that AI method has mostly been used in video games.\n\nKarl Tuyls, one of the startup’s co-founders, led the game theory and multi-agent research teams at DeepMind. In its investor pitch, H described this multi-agent approach as moving “beyond” current language models with AI capable of planning and memory, according to a presentation viewed by Bloomberg News.\n\nOn Tuesday, H said it had recruited 25 “AI engineers and scientists” for its initial team. The startup said it will build AI models “with capabilities across business and consumer verticals.”\n\nBloomberg News first reported on the startup’s existence and completion of the first tranche of its funding round. Business Insider previously reported details on the financing and some of the investors involved. Investors had discussed putting in roughly 40% of the financing in equity with the remainder coming in convertible debt, a vehicle increasingly used to purchase computing power for AI companies, people familiar with the matter said previously. H declined to comment on the details of its financing.\n\nRead More: DeepMind Alumni Raise $200 Million Round for Holistic AI\n\nAccording to an earlier company filing, UiPath put $32.5 million into the startup, splitting the investment into equity and convertible debt. In the release from H, the startup said it will be working with UiPath and other strategic partners on “commercial, market access and computing partnerships,” without providing further details.\n\n--With assistance from Lizette Chapman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +13.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 12.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, indicating a change of +28.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.61 points to a change of +31.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +12.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.65 indicates a change of +13.7% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOGL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $295.53 billion and $329.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.2% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures moved little in evening deals on Monday as momentum on Wall Street stalled after buying into technology stocks, ahead of earnings from market darling Nvidia, put the Nasdaq at record highs.\n\nUncertainty over interest rates also remained in play as warnings on sticky inflation from Federal Reserve officials continued to trickle in, with focus on the minutes of the central bank’s late-April meeting due this Wednesday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,331.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.1% to 18,748.50 points by 19:20 ET (23:20 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,923.0 points.\n\nTech strengthens ahead of Nvidia earnings\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to report quarterly earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, with focus squarely on whether the firm can meet market expectations for an exponential jump in earnings.\n\nThe company is seen as a bellwether for the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industry, and its earnings are likely to set the tone for the broader technology sector.\n\nNvidia is at the heart of a massive spike in market valuations over the past year, amid increasing hype over the rapidly-growing AI industry.\n\nTech stocks saw sustained buying ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, which also helped push the NASDAQ Composite to a record high close on Monday. The index vastly outperformed its Wall Street peers.\n\nNvidia rose 2.5% and was close to a record high. Its peers Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, with all three stocks seeing some gains in aftermarket trade.\n\nTech heavyweights including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) advanced between 0.4 and 1.3%.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 5,308.13 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.7% to a record high of 16,794.87 points on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, falling 0.5% to 39,806.77 points.\n\nMore Fed cues awaited amid rate uncertainty\n\nMarkets still remained on edge ahead of more cues from the Fed this week, specifically the minutes of its last meeting and addresses by several officials.\n\nWhile mildly softer consumer inflation readings for April sparked a rally on Wall Street, a slew of Fed officials warned that the bank still needed much more confidence that inflation was coming down, before it could begin cutting interest rates.\n\nRichmond Fed President Tom Barkin and New York Fed President John Williams are set to speak later on Tuesday. Both officials are members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe central bank is expected to potentially begin trimming rates by September, although this will also largely depend on the path of inflation.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures tread water; Nvidia anticipation puts Nasdaq at record high\n\nUS regulator to probe VinFast crash in California in which four died\n\nTrip.com ADR earnings missed by Â¥1.09, revenue fell short of estimates\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft debuts new Copilot+ PCs using OpenAI's GPT-4o while taking shots at Apple",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) is going all in on AI for the PC.\n\nThe company on Monday announced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, a new variety of computers equipped with so-called AI PC chips and running Microsoft's latest version of Windows 11 and its Copilot AI software.\n\nMicrosoft also revealed that its Copilot+ PCs will now run on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, allowing the assistant to interact with your PC via text, video, and voice. Users will also be able to share their screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app.\n\n\"The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert. This in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Monday. \"For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows.\"\n\nMicrosoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gives his keynote during the company's Windows event on Monday, May 20 at its headquarters in Redmond. (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nCopilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance.\n\nIn a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item.\n\nMicrosoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance.\n\nMicrosoft also touted the performance of its Copilot+ PCs and hammered home what it sees as a performance advantage over similar Apple (AAPL) devices.\n\nAccording to the company, a laptop running one of Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite chips will provide 20% more battery life than Apple's MacBook Air, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance. The company also demonstrated Adobe's Photoshop running on its Surface laptop and beating Apple's MacBook Air with M3 chips in certain tasks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to rolling out Copilot+ PC versions of its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro devices, Microsoft said this software will be featured in Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung products.\n\nMicrosoft's announcements come just a few weeks before rival Apple (AAPL) is expected to debut its own AI features across its product lines, including the iPhone and Mac, at its WWDC developer event on June 10.

        "content": "Microsoft To Unveil New Surface Devices At Redmond Event\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to reveal new hardware and software for consumer devices at an event on its Redmond, Washington campus on Monday.\n\nReuters reported that the announcement will include new versions of the Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, both of which will feature Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) chips based on Arm Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:ARM) architecture.\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips, equipped with a neural processing unit, will power the new devices, enhancing AI-focused applications like Microsoft’s Copilot software.\n\nThis move marks a significant shift from Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), whose processors have long dominated the PC market, towards lower-power Arm components vying for a share in Windows PCs.\n\nThis showcase comes just a day before Microsoft’s annual developer conference. Microsoft aims to solidify its position in the burgeoning market for consumer-friendly AI tools, a field in which it gained an early lead through its partnership with OpenAI.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft Unveils AMD-Powered AI Chips To Rival Nvidia: Report\n\nOpenAI and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently presented competing AI technologies capable of real-time, interruptible voice responses.\n\nGoogle’s updates include several new generative AI features for its search engine, underscoring the fierce competition among tech giants to lead in AI innovation.\n\nThe PC industry faces growing competition from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has seen success with its Arm-based custom chips, offering Macs enhanced battery life and performance.\n\nIn response, Microsoft has partnered with Qualcomm since 2016 to transition Windows to Arm’s architecture.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm’s exclusivity on Windows devices ends this year, potentially opening the market to other chipmakers like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nMicrosoft stock has gained more than 30% in the past 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and IShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW).\n\nPrice Action: MSFT shares are trading higher by 1.11% at $424.86 at the last check Monday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Microsoft’s Game-Changer!

Google cited this growing demand for AI as a key reason for its substantial investment.\n\nThe Hamina data center in Finland, which already operates with 97% carbon-free energy, exemplifies Google’s commitment to sustainable practices.\n\nThe facility will also contribute to the local community by redirecting excess heat to Hamina's district heating network, benefiting households, schools, and public buildings.\n\nGoogle has set an ambitious target to achieve net zero emissions across all its operations and value chain by 2030.\n\nThe Finnish investment is part of a broader strategy, which includes recent announcements of new data centers in the Netherlands and Belgium, aimed at expanding Google’s infrastructure while adhering to environmental sustainability goals.\n\nThe tech giant made several announcements around Gemini and its upcoming AI-powered features at its annual I/O developer conference.\n\nAlphabet stock has gained more than 40% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Cisco Surpasses Estimates As It Finally Gets Some AI Action Despite Steepest Revenue Drop Since 2009",
        "content": "Cisco Surpasses Estimates As It Finally Gets Some AI Action Despite Steepest Revenue Drop Since 2009\n\nOn Wednesday, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal third quarter results and both its top and bottom-line surpassed Wall Street’s estimates. However, this does not change the fact that revenue suffered its steepest decline in 15 years. Like in its previous quarterly report, Cisco attributed the sales softness by consumers setting up the equipment they received during earlier quarters, stating that it expects such installations to be mostly done by the end of the fiscal year. Despite the revenue decline, its stock still went up 8% during extended trading.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 27th, Cisco reported revenue contracted about 13% as it amounted to $12.7 billion, still surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $12.53 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings amounted to 88 cents per share, also topping LSEG’s consensus of 82 cents. But net income tanked 41% to $1.89 billion, or 46 cents per share.\n\nNetworking revenue which makes the majority of sales also melted as it dropped by 27% to $6.52 billion.\n\nCisco made a big step forward in the AI direction.\n\nDuring the quarter, the $28 billion acquisition of security software maker Splunk was completed and although it lowered the adjusted earnings per share by a penny, it also lifted revenue with a $413 million infusion. Over time, Cisco is expected to lower costs. But what’s more important is that Cisco’s acquisition of Splunk means a big boost in its cybersecurity and AI ambitions, as this is its biggest acquisition in its history that spans over a big less than four decades. With Splunk, Cisco is gaining a tool to face off its rivals, like Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CRWD), and the chance to stay relevant in a universe dominated by vicious tech titans, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon. Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google. Cisco is well-aware it cannot go alone against the giants anymore which is why it joined forces with its long-time rival Microsoft back in 2022. The response of consumers was so good that Microsoft and Cisco expanded their partnership, offering more solutions. Together, Microsoft and Cisco showed that with joint efforts, they can help their customers even better and power their digital transformation.\n\nCisco Altered Its Fiscal 2024 Guidance\n\nCisco lifted the full year revenue guidance range it provided in February, as it now expects a figure between $53.6 billion and $53.8 billion.\n\nIt also narrowed its adjusted earnings range as it now expects them between $3.69 to $3.71. As for fiscal 2025 revenue, CFO Scott Herren expects low- to mid-single digits growth rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins expressed his content that Cisco is approaching the end of supply chain challenges it has been struggling with for years. Cisco has undoubtedly been undergoing many changes and although recent quarters have been particularly challenging, Cisco is finally getting some AI action while there are early signs that enterprise spending is starting to recover.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Google invests 1 billion euros in Finnish data centre to drive AI growth",
        "content": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - Alphabet-owned Google will invest a further 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) into the expansion of its data centre campus in Finland to drive its artificial intelligence (AI) business growth in Europe, it said in a statement on Monday.\n\nIn recent years, many data centres have been located in the Nordic countries because of the region's cooler climate, tax breaks and abundant availability of renewable power.\n\nFinland's Nordic neighbours Sweden and Norway have recently grown increasingly critical of hosting them, with some industry experts arguing the Nordic countries should use their renewable power for products such as green steel that could leave higher surplus value in the countries.\n\nBut Finland's wind power capacity has increased so rapidly in recent years, by 75% to 5,677 megawatts in 2022 alone, that on windy days prices have plummeted to negative, industry statistics showed.\n\nTherefore there is still renewable capacity available for data centres such as Google's, which acquires wind power in Finland under long term contracts.\n\nAnalysts believe data centres' power consumption is set to massively increase due to the rapid growth in AI usage, which Google, too, cited for one of the reasons behind its investment decision, alongside its Hamina data centre in Finland already operating with 97% carbon-free energy.\n\n\"Heat coming out of our Finnish data center will be re-routed to the district heating network in nearby Hamina, covering local households, schools and public service buildings,\" Google said in the statement. It added that it aimed to achieve net zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030.\n\nIn addition to its Finnish investment, the search and cloud giant announced last month it would build new data centres in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n($1 = 0.9225 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Anne Kauranen in Helsinki; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n\nView comments",

Google declined to disclose what impact the investment will have on data capacity at the site.\n\nThe facility is located in Hamina, on the nation’s south coast. The region offers a good supply of renewable power, which is vital for the firm’s target to run every office and data center on green energy by the end of this decade.\n\nThe tech giant is also pioneering a project with the local utility to feed excess heat into the network of pipes that’s used to warm up homes in the area. The technology, called district heating, is common in parts of northern Europe. If successful, it could help to guide future investments, Ben Townsend, Google’s global head of infrastructure strategy and sustainability, said in an interview.\n\n“It may start to steer new site selection opportunities to locations where waste heat recovery and district heating is more readily implementable,” he said. The pilot project will provide the recovered heat for free to utility Haminan Energia Oy.\n\nGoogle is not the first tech firm in the Nordic region to offer its heat to local energy companies. Microsoft Corp. joined the Finnish utility Fortum Oyj in 2022 to capture and distribute the energy source to the local network.

        "title": "Microsoft to unveil AI devices and features ahead of developer conference",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft plans to announce several pieces of hardware and software related to consumer devices on Monday at an event at its Redmond, Washington, campus.\n\nThe Windows maker is expected to reveal a new version of its Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the personal computer market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft's product event, a day before the start of its annual developer conference, is open to journalists and industry analysts who attend in person. It will not be live-streamed.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet, as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "title": "Google Attacks Microsoft Cyber Failures in Effort to Steal Customers",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google is betting Microsoft Corp.’s very public cybersecurity failures — along with deep discounts — will persuade corporate and government customers to use the search giant’s productivity software rather than Office.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran State TV Says ‘No Sign of Life’ at Helicopter Crash Site Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is ‘Well on the Way’ One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks\n\nGovernment agencies that switch 500 or more users to Google Workspace Enterprise Plus for three years will get one year free and be eligible for a “significant discount” for the rest of the contract, said Andy Wen, the senior director of product management for Workspace. The Alphabet Inc. division is offering 18 months free to corporate customers that sign a three-year contract, a hefty discount after that and incident response services from Google’s Mandiant security business. All customers will receive free consulting services to help them make the switch.\n\nGoogle also released a white paper Monday highlighting its rival’s security lapses, and is considering launching similarly-themed social-media and advertising campaigns.\n\n“The repeated security challenges with Microsoft call for a better alternative for enterprises and public-sector organizations alike,” Google wrote in the white paper. “We believe Google Workspace presents a safer alternative, with a proven track record of engineering excellence, deep investment in cutting edge defenses, and a transparent culture where providing security for customers is treated as a profound responsibility.”\n\nLast month, the US Cyber Safety Review Board issued a scathing report documenting Microsoft’s inability to stop China-linked hackers from breaking into the email accounts of US officials last year. The report called on Microsoft to institute urgent reforms, which the company has pledged to do as part of its biggest security overhaul in more than two decades.\n\nRead More: Microsoft, Beset by Hacks, Grapples With Problem Years in the Making\n\nGoogle has struggled to persuade customers to ditch Office but says Microsoft’s cybersecurity travails have made customers more open to switching. At a recent Google conference, according to Wen, corporate customers said their boards and executives had given them a deadline to stop using Microsoft because they could “no longer sustain the risk.”\n\nWen also noted that Google conducted its own security overhaul after a 2009 hack that saw Chinese-linked attackers breach the company’s servers and gain access to a database containing details of US surveillance targets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe timing could be advantageous. People are increasingly familiar with Google’s applications after using them at home and school, while some corporations are unhappy with Office price increases and additional fees to use new artificial intelligence features.\n\nThere also is some appetite to reduce government agencies’ reliance on one vendor — especially one with security issues — according to Jeanette Manfra, a former Department of Homeland Security official who now runs Google’s global risk and compliance operation.\n\nStill, Google will have to overcome cultural resistance, she said, in part because many federal chief information officers are in their roles for only a few years and typically shy away from major new projects.\n\n“It’s a lot easier to just stick with your same path,” she said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "U.S. futures inch higher, Nvidia to report this week - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge higher after the Dow ended trading on Friday above the 40,000 mark for the first time. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is due to headline this week's corporate earnings calendar, with the maker of artificial intelligence-optimized chips expected to report another quarter of surging revenues. Elsewhere, several Fed officials are set to speak on Monday, as investors attempt to gauge to road ahead for the central bank's monetary policy.\n\n1. Futures point higher\n\nU.S. stock futures were broadly higher on Monday, suggesting an extension in a rally in the prior session that drove the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average to its first-ever close above the 40,000 level.\n\nBy 03:48 ET (07:48 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 19 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 4 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 22 points or 0.1%.\n\nRecent data indicating a possible cooling in the U.S. economy have alleviated some persistent inflation concerns, fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve will start to bring interest rates down from more than two-decade highs as soon as September. Along with the Dow, the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all touched record marks last week.\n\nThe durability of the strength on Wall Street will likely be tested by a fresh batch of corporate results this week, including quarterly returns from artificial intelligence darling Nvidia (see below). Durable goods and consumer sentiment data will also be in focus as markets hunt for more evidence that growth is moderating enough to give the Fed justification for rolling out rate cuts this year.\n\n2. Nvidia earnings ahead this week\n\nNvidia is set to highlight the earnings calendar this week, with traders keen to see if the maker of AI-specialized graphics processing units will once again post spiking revenues at its all-important data center unit.\n\nShares in the company have rocketed higher by nearly 92% this year, making it one of the focal points of the AI boom. In February, Nvidia said it expects revenues to jump to $24 billion in the first quarter, with Chief Executive Jensen Huang noting that he believed \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\"\n\nComments from Huang will also likely be in the spotlight. Nvidia faces competition from rival chipmakers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as supply chain constraints and geopolitical tensions that threaten AI chip exports from the U.S. to China. Meanwhile, major tech players like Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are reportedly beginning to build their own AI chips in-house, potentially limiting their need for Nvidia's chips.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Fed speakers, minutes on tap\n\nSeveral Fed officials are due to deliver speeches on Monday that may provide insight into the path ahead for the central bank's moentary policy.\n\nFed board members Christopher Waller, Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr are scheduled to speak at separate events.\n\nLater in the week, the Fed is set to publish the minutes from its April 30-May 1 meeting, when Chair Jerome Powell indicated that rates are likely to remain higher for longer because of lingering inflationary pressures.\n\nHowever, since then, data has shown that U.S. consumer prices -- a key gauge of inflation -- increased at a slower than anticipated pace in April, while a crucial labor market report undershot estimates.\n\nThe numbers bolstered wagers that the Fed will introduce two 25-basis point cuts to borrowing costs this year. Rates currently stand at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\n4. China keeps loan prime rate unchanged\n\nThe People’s Bank of China kept its benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) unchanged on Monday as widely expected, even as Beijing continued to roll out other stimulus measures to support the economy.\n\nThe PBOC maintained its one-year LPR at 3.45%, while the five-year rate, which is used to determine mortgage rates, was left at 3.95%.\n\nBoth rates were kept at record lows, as Beijing sought to shore up economic growth by keeping local monetary conditions as loose as possible.\n\nElsewhere, Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland Chinese property developers dropped despite Beijing announcing fresh measures last week aimed at supporting the ailing industry. China has unveiled a string of these policies in recent weeks, including a softening of home buying restrictions across several major cities and funds for local governments to buy real estate from developers.\n\n5. Crude gains amid Iran uncertainty\n\nCrude prices edged higher Monday, adding to the previous week’s gains, as uncertainty swirled around the political situation in the Middle East following the reported death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nBy 03:44 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.3% higher at $79.81 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $84.23 a barrel. Brent had ended the previous week up about 1%, its first weekly gain in three weeks, while WTI rose 2% on improved economic indicators from the U.S. and China, the world's largest oil consumers.\n\nIranian state media said Raisi, who was seen a possible successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash on Sunday in a remote region in the country's north-west.\n\nRaisi’s death comes amid simmering tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, with Israel and the militant group Hamas at war in Gaza. Israel and Iran also launched strikes against each other earlier this year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. futures inch higher, Nvidia to report this week - what's moving markets\n\nJapan manufacturers want BOJ to keep yen stable, survey shows\n\nTop Japan companies agree to 5.58% average pay hike, business lobby says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "Over the past few years, Michael Burry has gained more media attention with his recession warnings and market crash \"predictions\" than he did for accurately foreseeing the 2008 financial crisis. But his persistent warnings about recession and market crashes never realized, denting his reputation as an expert and hedge fund manager.\n\nWere Michael Burry's Recession Warnings Wrong?\n\nA cursory look at Burry's portfolio moves shows that he's becoming more fickle than ever, constantly buying stocks and then selling them after a few months. In 2022, when the inflation storm was at its peak and the market was panicking, Burry tweeted:\n\n\"As I said about 2008, it is like watching a plane crash. It hurts, it is not fun, and I'm not smiling.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Wall Street Journal analyzed Michael Burry's recession warnings and found that he's made at least five \"dire\" market predictions. But that's not the news. The news is that each time he predicted something horrifying about the market, the S&P 500 saw positive returns over the next six months. Six-month average annualized gain posted by the S&P 500 following these five Burry predictions was 34%.\n\n\"Overconfidence\" or Something Else?\n\nWhy are Michael Burry's market predictions not accurate anymore? Researchers Jerker Denrell and Christina Fang in 2010 published an interesting research paper titled Predicting the Next Big Thing: Success as a Signal of Poor Judgment. The paper talked about the reasons why experts who make accurate predictions about \"extreme\" events often follow up with more, and fail. The paper highlighted several reasons behind this trend, but one of these was overconfidence.\n\n\"An alternative explanation of our results is that a successful prediction generates overconfidence. Overconfident individuals, who overestimate the precision of their private information relative to publicly available information, are likely to make less accurate predictions. For example, Hilary and Menzly (2006) show that analysts who have predicted earnings more accurately than the median analyst in the previous four quarters tend to be simultaneously less accurate and further from the consensus in their subsequent predictions.\"\n\nDespite his recession warnings not playing out as he predicted, Michael Burry remains one of the market geniuses whose moves are watched keenly by investors. For this article we scanned Michael Burry's Q1'2024 portfolio and picked some notable stocks he sold in the quarter. These are just five stocks that he sold in the March quarter. Insider Monkey had published a long list of stocks dumped by Burry in the first three months of 2024. Some notable names include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL). Click to see 7 Stocks Michael Burry is Selling in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBig Lots Inc (NYSE:BIG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 10\n\nDiscount retailer Big Lots Inc (NYSE:BIG) was a disappointment for Michael Burry. The Big Short investor had bought 225,000 shares of Big Lots Inc (NYSE:BIG) back in the fourth quarter of 2023. The stock has lost about 53% in value over the past one year, and 9% in the last six months.\n\nGEN Restaurant Group Inc (NASDAQ:GENK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 10\n\nCalifornia-based restaurant company GEN Restaurant Group Inc (NASDAQ:GENK) is one of the stocks Michael Burry is selling in 2024. Scion Asset Management sold all 154,142 shares of GEN Restaurant Group Inc (NASDAQ:GENK) it had owned in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWasatch Micro Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding GEN Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:GENK) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“GEN Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:GENK) was the strategy’s greatest detractor. The company owns GEN Korean BBQ, a fast-growing experiential restaurant chain operating in seven states of the U.S. GENK offers customers a unique dining experience where they serve as their own chefs, preparing meals on embedded grills in the center of each table. The extensive menu consists of traditional Korean and Korean-American food, including high-quality meats, seafood and mixed vegetables. We bought GENK as an initial public offering (IPO). Afterward, we purchased additional shares on the open market. During the year prior to the IPO, we met with the management team and visited the restaurants several times—and our qualitative assessment was extremely positive. In terms of our quantitative assessment, we were impressed with GENK’s contribution margins in the vicinity of 20% and its EV-to-EBITDA valuation, which was below high-quality peers in the restaurant business. For the most part, the company’s fundamentals have progressed in line with our initial expectations. And every one of GENK’s 36 locations generates positive cash flow. But small operational improvements are needed in seven locations. Unfortunately, investors are inherently impatient with a newly public company that isn’t firing on all cylinders. While we’re disappointed that GENK stumbled in the aftermath of its IPO, we remain comfortable investing alongside company insiders, who still own 87% of the outstanding shares.”\n\nQurate Retail Inc Series A (NASDAQ:QRTEA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nMichael Burry sold all 600,000 Qurate Retail Inc Series A (NASDAQ:QRTEA) shares he had in his portfolio in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nSilver Ring Value Partners stated the following regarding Qurate Retail, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRTEA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Qurate Retail, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRTEA): I let our remaining call options expire in January, and have not replaced them. The company is now a turnaround that is dealing with a stretched balance sheet and a potential recession. I have not yet been able to discern material evidence that the turnaround is already succeeding. Meanwhile, if the cycle were to occur sooner and be deeper than currently expected, the equity would quickly become worthless.\n\nIt’s tempting to double-down on one’s bets especially when there is such a huge amount of upside if the company is able to turn itself around and avoid bankruptcy. After all, there is still the chance of the equity being worth $10+ vs. the under $1 share price. However, merely being lured by the large upside is a mistake – lottery tickets also have huge upside relative to the price paid, but they are known for their negative expected value. At this point I don’t have any differentiated insights that would allow me to assign probabilities better than the market to the various scenarios, and so I am going to avoid gambling and pass.\n\nI will keep monitoring the situation and if there are signs that the turnaround is succeeding, I would be happy to revisit my decision even at a much higher price. In turnarounds, the best expected return is usually obtained when the odds have shifted in the company’s favor even if the upside has been reduced.”\n\nLike QRTEA, Burry is also selling Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nNexstar Media Group Inc (NASDAQ:NXST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nMichael Burry had started cutting his stakes in Nexstar Media Group Inc (NASDAQ:NXST) in the fourth quarter of 2023. But in the March quarter this year, he sold the entire 32,500 shares of the Texas-based media company.\n\nOver the past one year the stock has gained about 5.7%.\n\nBurr is also dumping major names like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nBruker Corp (NASDAQ:BRKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nScientific instruments company Bruker Corp (NASDAQ:BRKR) is in our list of the stocks Michael Burry is selling in 2024. Burry had bought 50,000 shares of Bruker Corp (NASDAQ:BRKR) in the last quarter of 2023, only to sell all of them in the following quarter. Over the past six months Bruker shares are up 22%.\n\nThese were just 5 stocks Michael Burry sold in 2024. He's selling many more this year.\n\nClick to see 7 More Stocks Michael Burry is Selling in 2024.\n\nDisclosure.None.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Stock in the Newest Member of the $2 Trillion Club?",
        "content": "There are only seven companies in the world with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion. Among these businesses, only Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) have reached an even more exclusive club.\n\nNo, I'm not talking about gaining access to the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- although each of those companies is in that club, too. All four of these tech giants have a market cap of at least $2 trillion, and Alphabet is the newest member to reach that milestone.\n\nFollowing an encouraging first-quarter earnings report, Alphabet's shares have soared as high as 9%. Is it too late for growth investors to scoop up shares in Alphabet since eclipsing a $2 trillion valuation?\n\nI don't think so. In fact, now looks like as good a time as ever to scoop up some shares. Let's explore why.\n\nDon't sleep on the advertising business\n\nOne of the biggest knocks against Alphabet over the last couple of years is that its core advertising business has been slowing down. Stiff competition from Meta Platforms, TikTok, and some smaller players, such as Pinterest and Snap, have found ways to attract cyclical advertising dollars away from Alphabet.\n\nWhat I think investors are missing is that even though Alphabet's advertising business may not be growing at levels seen in the past, this segment remains enormously profitable for the company. In fact, Alphabet's advertising and services operations account for nearly all the company's operating income -- with cloud computing contributing nominal profitability. GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe chart above demonstrates the growth in Alphabet's operating income relative to revenue. Although Alphabet's revenue has started slowing down a bit, the company is still achieving an impressive level of operating efficiency. This has resulted in significant margin expansion and robust free-cash-flow generation for Alphabet. It's these excess profits that are fueling the next frontier of Alphabet beyond advertising. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAn end-to-end artificial intelligence platform\n\nThe hottest ticket in the technology realm right now is artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last year or so, Alphabet has made a number of strategic investments in AI. Namely, the company's generative AI model (called Gemini) is Alphabet's response to the highly popular ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough ChatGPT may have a first-mover advantage, Alphabet has a secret weapon of its own: data. Remember, Alphabet owns Google and YouTube -- the world's top two most visited websites.\n\nAlphabet collects an unprecedented amount of data. Considering large language models (LLMs) essentially rely on vast libraries of data, Alphabet has a competitive advantage that will be hard to match.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere Alphabet really has an opportunity to leapfrog the competition is in integrating AI across its entire ecosystem. While Alphabet may be best known for Google and YouTube, keep in mind that the company also has a workplace productivity suite akin to Microsoft Office and a budding cloud computing business that grew 28% just during the first quarter.\n\nThe valuation narrative is compelling\n\nThe chart below benchmarks the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio among mega-cap tech. Alphabet's forward P/E of 22.6 is the lowest among this cohort. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nShares in Alphabet rose significantly following first-quarter earnings due to the company's demonstrated growth across the business and the strides it's making in AI. Yet, even after a big upswing, the company is still valued at a noticeable discount compared to most of its peers.\n\nIt's very possible that many investors are still narrowly focused on advertising revenue and missing the bigger picture: margin expansion, rising cash flow, and how Alphabet reinvests these profits. I think Alphabet stock is dirt cheap right now, and I see the disparity in valuation multiples above as a compelling buying opportunity.\n\nNow looks like a lucrative time to take advantage of the current trading activity in Alphabet and scoop up some shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Snapchat’s Spiegel Shifts Focus to AI After Reviving Ad Business",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc. Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said he’s investing more aggressively in bringing artificial intelligence and machine learning to Snapchat to make it more interesting for its users, the next major shift after years spent overhauling its advertising business.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran’s President Missing After Helicopter Crash in Dense Fog Even If Alito Is Right, the Upside-Down Flag Was Wrong Gantz Says He’ll Quit Unless Netanyahu Moves to New War Plan China-Bound Oil Tanker Hit by Houthi Missile in Red Sea, US Says Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge\n\n“There was a recognition that we’d fallen behind the curve on the machine learning side, which, to some degree, was reflected in the business performance,” Spiegel said in an interview. “We needed to improve there and bring together some of our most senior machine learning folks to just talk about what it would look like for us to get to state of the art and really invest.”\n\nBeing able to spend more time on fun improvements — like making the content on the Snapchat app more personalized or building artificial reality filters and software — has been a hard-earned accomplishment for Spiegel. His company has been grappling with monumental shifts in how people use social media apps and what kind of digital ads marketers want to buy on them. He spent much of his time the last few years overseeing the revamp of Snapchat’s money-making advertising business, making big changes that are finally showing signs they’re working.\n\nIn 2021, the Snapchat experience revolved around messaging and Stories from friends and camera filters that spiced up posts. For advertisers, it was largely about telling brands’ stories that stirred emotions, not so much campaigning for immediate purchases. Snap needed to evolve its app for both of those important groups, a change that would require new technology, expensive infrastructure and a reshaped organization.\n\nNow, the company is funneling money into building machine learning, AI and augmented reality features that play into Snap’s ads business and user feeds. Instead of building it all in-house like peers at Alphabet Inc. or Meta Platforms Inc., Snap is working with big tech partners like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet’s Google for cloud partnerships, freeing it up to work on product innovations and new Snapchat experiences.\n\nStill, Snap expects to continue investing about 84 cents per daily user each quarter going forward on infrastructure alone. That’s roughly $1.5 billion a year, just over half estimated annual operating expenses, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nStory continues\n\nDirect Ads\n\nIt’s an investment strategy made possible by the necessary yet self-inflicted pain of overhauling the company’s advertising business. Snap has moved from a focus on brand advertising to expanding into direct response campaigns that prompt a more immediate purchase or app download — ads that are more technically challenging to build, but also much more lucrative.\n\nThe overhaul has come at a price. Snap’s stock has fallen more than 70% since its pandemic highs, but the company has made the improvements that Spiegel promised. After posting the first two quarters ever of declining revenue in 2023, Snap’s new ad offerings are catching on. Snap is back to growing double digits and analysts expect its best sales year ever. After a positive earnings report last month, the stock is up more than 71% from a year ago.\n\n“We just try to be brutally realistic about the operating environment, but then really have faith in our team and our ability to execute through it,” Spiegel said from the stage at the Bloomberg Tech Summit earlier this month. “That allows us to keep that positivity that I think is so critical in such a volatile period of time.”\n\nAnalysts, too, are taking notice.\n\n“Years of diligent work are beginning to pay off for Snap’s ad business,” Max Willens, a senior analyst at Emarketer, said after the latest earnings report. “Snap appears to be developing some credibility as a platform that can deliver.”\n\nBuilding Again\n\nWith ad revenue growing again, Snapchat plans to expand its content offerings and augmented reality experiences – areas where Spiegel plans on spending more time personally. It’s also pushing new product experiences. Snap is hoping to improve its recommendation algorithms for Stories and its short-form video feature, Spotlight, which competes with TikTok. The next big swing for Snapchat is to bring those two products together. “I think that’s going to be really beneficial to the way that people discover our content on our service, so that’s a big priority,” Spiegel said.\n\nHaving to play catchup is a unique position for Spiegel, who’s developed a reputation for being ahead of the competition when it comes to identifying trends in the social media industry. Some cases have been a positive — like Stories and face filters, or an in-app AI chatbot and a successful social media subscription offering.\n\nOther trends that Spiegel has spotted have been harder to stomach. He sounded the alarm early on the post-pandemic pullback in marketing spending, and was among the first to initiate deep layoffs and other cost-cutting at Snap, killing projects to refocus the business on fewer priorities.\n\nWhen it comes to the future of computing, Snap is hoping that Spiegel’s product instincts will pay off again. The CEO initially put his stake in augmented reality, while the company’s chief public competitor, Meta, went all in on virtual reality. When Snap was building glasses and filters that change the world around you when captured on camera, Meta was working on bulky headsets and transporting users to virtual worlds. Meta has since spent more time and resources on smart glasses, and recently rolled out Ray-Ban sunglasses equipped with cameras — much like Snap’s own camera glasses, called Spectacles, that were launched in 2016.\n\nSnap hasn’t released a new pair of its own glasses in more than three years, but it’s still building and developing the technology behind the scenes. Users already see the work within Snapchat, like in an uncannily realistic filter that shows what you’d look like with 1990’s style, or filters that work live at LA Rams football games and alter fans’ faces on the jumbotron.\n\nFor Spiegel, augmented reality is promising because it can be “integrated in the world and shared together,” he says. “A lot of what we’re focused on are things that just aren’t possible with technology today. So whether it’s a VR headset or your computer or your phone, I think people feel really isolated by the technology products that they use today. We’re looking towards this future where people are going to play together and learn together and work together in the same physical shared environment, but enabled by augmented reality.”\n\nIt’s similar to how the company sees its Snapchat user base, which primarily uses the app for messaging but can also post or scroll through content. “What we find is that people continue to come back to the service to talk with their close friends and family,” Spiegel says. “Where we do see churn, it’s often times where we haven’t been able to connect people to the folks that matter the most to them.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’ Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Alphabet Goes All In on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Is It Time to Go All In on the Stock?",
        "content": "Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) showed that it's going all in on artificial intelligence (AI), unveiling new AI features and products at its Google I/O developer conference on May 14. The company has long invested in AI, but there have been some lingering doubts among investors that it is behind and that AI could disrupt its dominant position in search. This can be seen in the company's valuation, which trails other leading large-cap AI names. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe company, however, has been working to dispel this notion. Its recent developer conference was the latest foray to show its AI innovations.\n\nAI-powered search\n\nThe biggest announcement to come out of the developer conference undoubtedly is that Alphabet is set to fully incorporate AI overlays into its Google search results.\n\nGoogle search has long been based on the company serving up website links to search queries. That will remain for the simple queries that Google typically serves alongside ads when giving search results. However, for more complex subjects and searches, the company will now provide AI-generated summaries at the top of its search results.\n\nThe new AI search overlays are currently being rolled out. They're expected to reach 1 billion people by the end of the year.\n\nOne debate that remains is how Alphabet will make money from AI search. Google only monetizes about 20% of its searches with ads and only gets paid if users find those ads useful and click on them. That means that the company currently doesn't make money on 80% of the searches it runs.\n\nAI overlay results will likely be used for the search queries that the company doesn't currently monetize. However, Alphabet management has already talked about adding ads into its search generative experience (SGE) and experimenting with new ad formats. This will basically open up monetization opportunities for the 80% of search traffic on which it currently doesn't make money.\n\nThat will provide a long growth runway, which currently isn't reflected in Alphabet's valuation. Image source: Getty Images\n\nOther AI innovations\n\nAlphabet isn't stopping with search when it comes to AI innovations. Its newly bolstered Gemini AI model will be incorporated in various products.\n\nThis will include a new AI assistant named Gemini Live that will be able to take voice commands and interact with apps such as Gmail and Google Messages. The AI assistant will also be able to access a smartphone's camera and allow Gemini Live to interact with the real world and what it can see through the camera lens\n\nThe company demonstrated that its new AI-search assistant can craft plans for users, as well. One example that it used was finding a recipe and then adding the ingredients needed into a shopping list. The AI overlay was also able to adjust the recipe's measurements for the number of people being served. This feature can also be used to plan vacations and make itineraries and recommendations.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet also built Gemini into its Workspace line of products. It will be accessible as a side panel on apps like Gmail and Google Docs and be able to summarize emails and suggest responses, as well as translate different languages.\n\nThe company demonstrated setting up a virtual teammate within Workspace that can be tasked with various duties, such as monitoring and tracking projects and organizing information. Gemini for Workspace is a paid add-on subscription that costs about $20 a month per user for up to 1,000 uses a month.\n\nIt also introduced Gemini Nano specifically for Android Pixel smartphones, which will work without an internet connection. Nano can do such things as summarize conversations, lectures, or interviews, as well as detecting suspicious financial activity and fraud. Other AI features that Alphabet demonstrated included VideoFX, which lets users use AI to help create 1080p videos; AI image generator Imaggen 3; and Ask Photos, which allows users to search for photos and videos through natural conversation.\n\nWhile most of these innovations are incremental, they demonstrate that Google isn't sitting back when it comes to AI. The company generates a lot of cash and will continue to invest in this area.\n\nTime to go all in on the stock\n\nAlphabet is among the cheapest of the large-cap companies investing heavily in AI, trading at just over a 22.5x forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). Valuation alone, though, isn't enough reason to buy the stock. However, the company could very well be one of the biggest AI winners -- if not the biggest.\n\nFirst, Alphabet has developed and owns its own large language model (LLM) that it can tie into decades of search datasets and analytics that can be used for training. It also has its own cloud offering and hardware ecosystem that it can monetize further by incorporating AI features. That in and of itself is powerful, and no other company offers all that.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet now has an opportunity to slowly monetize the 80% of search results from which it currently wasn't generating any revenue. That's a huge opportunity.\n\nSo yes, it does look like a great time for long-term investors to invest in Alphabet stock. The company is an undervalued AI leader with a lot of potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You'll Be Glad You Bought 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Sentiments about stocks can change sharply, especially over a five-year period. This is true of both the artificial intelligence (AI) industry and AI-driven stocks. As the technology has advanced, many AI stocks have fallen out of favor while others have moved to the forefront.\n\nLooking forward five years, nobody knows for sure which AI stocks will emerge as the market leaders. Nonetheless, some stocks will likely remain major forces in the AI industry for years to come, and three Motley Fool analysts believe investors will likely reach 2029 feeling glad they bought these companies.\n\nPoised to meet the world's need for more cybersecurity\n\nJake Lerch (CrowdStrike): My pick is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions with a proven track record in the industry.\n\nPart of why CrowdStrike is an excellent buy-and-hold candidate is the overall growth of the cybersecurity market. In short, cybercrime is everywhere, and organizations now face enormous risks if they fail to secure their digital assets. Casino operators have seen their slot machines hacked, healthcare providers have had their billing systems compromised, and pipeline operators have watched as their infrastructure has been shut down.\n\nThis presents a significant opportunity for companies like CrowdStrike, as the demand for cybersecurity solutions is poised to surge. Statista estimates that the worldwide cybersecurity market will expand to over $500 billion by 2030, up from around $300 billion in 2022, indicating a potential for substantial growth in the sector.\n\nWith the overall market growing, CrowdStrike is leveraging its competitive advantages within the sector. The company operates a subscription-based model, selling access to its Falcon platform and various cloud-based, AI-powered security modules designed to protect endpoints, networks, and data.\n\nCrowdStrike is a one-stop shop, and it's clear that its customers like what it can offer. As CEO George Kurtz put it, \"Customers favor our single platform approach. ... CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's consolidator of choice, innovator of choice, and platform of choice to stop breaches.\"\n\nConsequently, CrowdStrike is delivering exceptional financial results. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended Jan. 31), CrowdStrike reported annual recurring revenue of $3.4 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. Moreover, CrowdStrike was profitable for the fourth straight quarter. This marks a significant milestone in the company's life cycle as regular profits have become the norm.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, analysts expect CrowdStrike to grow revenue by 30% this year and 27% next year. In summary, CrowdStrike remains an up-and-coming company in a fast-growing sector. Growth-oriented investors should take notice; this stock looks set for a bright future.\n\nBuy this SaaS stock on the heels of its fabulous quarter\n\nJustin Pope (Monday.com): My pick is Monday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY), and it's pretty obvious once you consider all the fundamentals here. The business is firing on all cylinders, as evidenced by Q1 earnings that were so good that Wall Street sent the stock soaring roughly 20% higher on the news. What got investors so excited? It boils down to a company growing both customers and profits rapidly.\n\nMonday.com is a SaaS business that sells cloud-based software on a subscription model. The product is simple -- it's a collaborative platform that helps company employees manage projects and collaborate on work tasks. The company refers to itself as a workplace \"OS,\" short for operating system.\n\nThe idea is that a person or two begin using the software, and it spreads throughout a company as it becomes popular. That's why Monday.com has a stellar 114% net revenue retention rate for customers with at least 10 users. Moreover, customers spending at least $50,000 annually grew 48% year over year in Q1 to over 2,400.\n\nMonday.com is doing this while putting up all-time highs in cash flow and non-GAAP earnings of $0.61 per share, blowing away analysts' estimates by $0.21. This company still sports a modest $11 billion market capitalization, which sets up investors for stellar returns if Monday.com eventually becomes a major player in the enterprise software space.\n\nMonday.com is doing everything right, making the stock worthy of closer examination by long-term investors. Those looking five years out could have a gem on their hands today.\n\nThis AI pioneer is not going anywhere\n\nWill Healy(Alphabet): Although it is amazing how fast investors have soured on the AI prospects of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) over the past year, my choice is the Google parent. Long dominant in search, it first integrated AI into its search tool in 2001. It has since applied AI to all of its applications and products, proclaiming itself an \"AI first\" company in 2016.\n\nNonetheless, the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT appeared to catch Alphabet off guard. Its search tool faced its first meaningful competitive threat in years when Microsoft's Bing partnered with ChatGPT.\n\nMoreover, when Alphabet responded with its generative AI product called Gemini, users gave it mixed reviews. Although it recently rolled out AI-native search to all users for the first time, investors seem more optimistic about the AI of other mega-techs such as Microsoft or Amazon.\n\nHowever, despite missteps, counting Alphabet out is likely premature. Besides its extensive experience in the AI field, Alphabet invests heavily in research. Among the companies Alphabet owns, it combined subsidiaries to form Google DeepMind, which takes a multidisciplinary approach to developing AI applications.\n\nAdditionally, Google Cloud, which uses and supports AI applications, is one of its fastest-growing segments. In the first quarter of 2024, its revenue increased 28%, compared to 15% for the company overall. It has also emerged as the third-largest cloud provider. Image source: Statista.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet has tremendous resources to back DeepMind and Google Cloud or to buy out other businesses. As of the end of Q1, the company claimed $108 billion in liquidity, an amount unmatched by almost all of its potential competitors.\n\nIncredibly, its cash pile could continue to climb. In Q1 alone, Alphabet generated nearly $17 billion in free cash flow, and for all of 2023, that free cash flow came in at over $69 billion. This, along with its existing AI technologies, gives Alphabet tremendous optionality as it works to remain a leader in AI and related industries.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and CrowdStrike made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 13, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock to Buy Now and Hold For a Decade",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has created a lot of buzz since early last year. Even as the technology has been around since the 1950s, recent developments show that these algorithms have improved by an order of magnitude. Generative AI has shown its mettle for a wide and growing variety of tasks, including streamlining processes, creating original content, and increasing productivity, with a flood of new applications on the drawing board.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai is emphatic that these algorithms will change virtually everything. \"Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It's bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself.\"\n\nThe opportunity is enormous. The generative AI market is expected to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Companies at the leading edge of this technological shift will be among the first to profit from this expected windfall, enriching investors along the way.\n\nThere a plenty of companies that will benefit from AI, but I believe Alphabet represents a particularly compelling opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAn industry leader and more\n\nIn order to understand the magnitude of the opportunity, it's important to view AI through the lens of Alphabet's existing business interests, which are considerable.\n\nGoogle has been the search leader for nearly a quarter of a century, recently controlling 91% of the market, according to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter. The company has consistently improved its algorithms over the years and, in so doing, has become the gold standard.\n\nIts search engine is the conduit for the company's industry-leading digital advertising. It's estimated that Google controlled roughly 39% of the market last, according to online data company Statista. The company's advertising chops are well-documented, and while many competitors have surfaced over the years, Google continues to hold the high ground.\n\nAfter years of stagnation, the digital advertising industry is mounting a long-awaited recovery, which will benefit Alphabet. Indeed, the company just posted its best year-over-year revenue growth rate in nearly two years, with digital advertising leading the charge.\n\nLet's not forget Google Cloud, the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider. While it still trails Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, it's growing faster than the industry average. Google Cloud grew 28% year over year in the calendar first quarter, outpacing AWS's 17% growth, but lagging Azure's 31% growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGemini, the twins\n\nAlphabet's twin offerings of Google Search and Google Cloud represent two distinct ways for the company to profit from recent advancements in generative AI.\n\nLate last year, Alphabet unveiled Gemini, the company's \"largest and most capable AI model.\" This week, at Google's I/O 2024 Developers Conference, it debuted a host of new cutting-edge features designed to help Google maintain its stranglehold on the search market and boost the stickiness of its ancillary services.\n\nGemini will use generative AI to organize how search results are displayed and will offer AI Overviews for more complicated queries. It also enables video search -- whereby a user can ask a question and upload a short, supporting video to find answers. Additional features, including meal and travel planning, are currently being tested in Search Labs and are expected to be released to the public later this year.\n\nThe second prong of Alphabet's opportunity is the company's cloud AI offerings. At Google's Cloud Next event last month, the company announced that Gemini 1.5 Pro, its flagship large language model (LLM), was available for public preview on its Vertex AI platform. This week, Alphabet highlighted Gemini's multimodal capability, calling it \"a frontier model built to be natively multimodal from the beginning, that [can] reason across text, images, video, code, and more.\" This gives developers the ability to create complex and flexible AI models from scratch.\n\nThe Vertex AI platform now offers more than 150 prebuilt AI models, including Google's own, open-source, and third-party models. With these, Google Cloud customers can accelerate their own AI development \"to build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications,\" according to the company.

        "content": "Jim Cramer on Friday analyzed the market rally following the latest CPI data which showed inflation was easing in April. Cramer said bears are clearly fighting an \"uphill\" battle and unless they could get any clear sign that inflation is heating up, he expects the rally to continue.\n\nCramer Thinks The Market is \"Outrageously Bullish\"\n\nIn another program last week Cramer said this market feels \"almost blasphemous\" to him because it's led by an \"outrageously bullish\" combination of stocks, many of which he believes don’t deserve to rally.\n\nJim Cramer said that the NASDAQ, S&P 500 and the Dow recently touching record \"defies\" the conventional wisdom on \"what could happen\" at this stage of the business cycle.\n\n\"Shut Up and Drive\"\n\nCramer yet again let it out on the bears and market skeptics, saying the bears \"have had it wrong.\" Cramer said when you look at the stocks they tell you that market naysayers continuously warning about a hot economy, high CPI, budget deficit and low consumer sentiment are \"awful.\" According to Cramer, the stocks are saying:\n\n\"Shut up and drive!\"\n\nJim Cramer highlighted that in the past, when one group of stocks was going higher, usually its opposite camp declined. But this trend has been defied in the recent market rallies where apparently \"mutually exclusive\" group of stocks are surging at the same time — banks, tech, industrials, utilities, to name a few.\n\nCramer Awaits the \"Biggest Earnings Report of the Entire Year\"\n\nCramer is also on tenterhooks, waiting for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings, which he called the \"biggest earnings report of the entire year.\"\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired in May and picked 5 stocks he's recommending investors in the current environment. Instead of Cramer's famous picks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), you will see some new, lesser-known names in the list.\n\nMind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 4\n\nMind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD) is working on treatments for psychiatry, addiction, pain and neurology. Cramer said in a latest program that he likes any company working on treatments that help people \"do good\" and \"get rid of pain\" without getting them \"hooked.\" He also said that he is a \"believer\" in Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD).\n\nHe also said he doesn’t \"care\" if such stocks don't make a lot of money for now because people should \"recognize\" that this is an \"unmet need\" and it \"will make money in the end.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nWhile talking about IT consulting company Accenture, Jim Cramer said in a latest program that he thinks SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is better than Accenture.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). The most notable stake in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $983 million stake in the company.\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is up about 28% so far this year.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance during the first quarter were SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), Apple (not owned), and Amazon.\n\nAfter delivering a robust fourth quarter, SAP’s stock price again rose significantly in the first quarter of 2024 on solid 4Q23 earnings and full-year guidance that was revised modestly higher. Importantly, SAP’s transition to the cloud (a core part of our thesis on the business) continues at pace, and the company is seeing both strong cloud revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins. Management is guiding cloud sales growth through 2025 in the mid-20% range, which we view as reasonable and attractive. We view SAP as one of the more resilient software business models as it is an essential part of their customers’ day-to-day operations and cannot easily be turned off or scaled back. Additionally, we think CEO Christian Klein is honest, competent, and long-term minded— traits we value highly in leadership.”\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nWe recently covered that Jim Cramer was in a wait-and-see mode on Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) ahead of a key decision in which Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) was expected to give a verdict on its hefty dividend and business outlook. Cramer was expecting the company to cut its dividend, which he believed would be a logical decision to make. Lo and behold, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) rattled investors by slashing its dividend by a whopping 80%. After the cut, while the stock tumbled to new lows, Cramer sounded bullish on the stock, expressing his full trust in CEO Sandra B. Cochran.\n\nCramer thinks Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) CEO will \"succeed\" with the new transformation because \"she is a hitter.\"\n\nIn addition to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Cramer is also bullish on Cracker Barrel.\n\nModine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer is extremely bullish on Modine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD). When asked about the Wisconsin-based thermal management company during his latest program, Cramer said, while hitting the buy, buy, buy button:\n\n\"Ok, that kind of metal-bending industrial company is precisely what's working here.\"\n\nCramer also said that Modine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD) is a \"Club-like\" name, saying his investing club propends investing in stocks similar to Modine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD).\n\nIn addition to MOD, Cramer also likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nCarillon Chartwell Small Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) was another strong performer. Modine’s performance technologies segment is experiencing high demand as it provides thermal solutions for electronic vehicle (EV) and hybrid vehicle manufacturers. The company also has focused on growth opportunities in the data-center market, selling data center cooling solutions needed for energy intensive artificial intelligence (AI) projects.”\n\nModerna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nWhen asked about Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) recently, Jim Cramer said that he's a \"believer\" in the stock and he never \"backed away\" from his thesis on the stock. Cramer said Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) went \"crazy\" during the pandemic, then crashed:\n\n\"Ever since it crashed, I'm in, I'm in,\" Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer is recommending many more stocks in May.\n\nClick to see 5 More Jim Cramer Stock Picks in May 2024.\n\nDisclosure.None.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Investigate Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) At US$176?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Alphabet’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Alphabet?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Alphabet today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $216.27, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Alphabet’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of Alphabet look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Alphabet's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 49%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in GOOGL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GOOGL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Alphabet mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks at All-Time Highs I'd Buy Right Now",
        "content": "While it's tough to argue that most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks would be bad long-term investments, there are two in particular that I'd be eager to buy right now. Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is trading at just 2% below its all-time high, but its profitability is still in the relatively early stages.\n\nThe other is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google. Alphabet actually just reached a fresh all-time high as I'm writing this (on May 16), and its recent results gave investors a lot to smile about.\n\nHere's a rundown of why I'd buy both of them right now (I already own Amazon) despite the strong recent performance.\n\nAmazon's business has been impressive recently\n\nAmazon is a company that doesn't need much of an introduction, with a dominant share of the U.S. e-commerce market and the leading cloud services business (AWS). Long-term investors have been handsomely rewarded for their patience, but the company could still have lots of room to grow on both sides.\n\nOn the e-commerce side of the business, Amazon.com is the clear leader, with a larger e-commerce market share in the United States than its next 10 competitors combined. But e-commerce only makes up about 15% of U.S. retail sales today, and even lower percentages in some of the other markets where the company operates. And while Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cloud services leader, the global cloud computing market is about $500 billion in size as of 2023 but is expected to grow to five times that level by 2032.\n\nNot only does Amazon still have a ton of growth potential, but CEO Andy Jassy's plans to improve efficiency are starting to pay off. In the most recent quarter, Amazon's operating income more than tripled year over year, driven by especially strong growth in AWS as well as advertising revenue, both of which are high-margin businesses.\n\nAn absolute cash machine with room to grow\n\nUnlike Amazon, Alphabet is already a massively profitable business. Its main subsidiary, Google, owns some of the most dominant platforms and applications in the world, including the massive Google Search business, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, Android, and much more. It also has the Google Cloud business, which is a direct competitor to AWS.\n\nWhile some of Google's businesses are quite mature, there's still a lot of room to optimize its advertising business, which is the primary way its non-Cloud businesses make most of their money. And we've already mentioned the massive growth potential of cloud services over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne thing to realize is that all of Google's businesses have incredible margins. Over the past four quarters, Alphabet has produced a 26% net margin. In 2023, Alphabet generated net income of nearly $74 billion, and the company has about $108 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. So not only does the company have plenty of financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities, but it returns tons of capital to shareholders through buybacks, and it just declared its first-ever dividend.\n\nAn all-time high doesn't mean the same thing as \"expensive\"\n\nTo be sure, these aren't cheap stocks. Alphabet trades for roughly 30 times forward earnings expectations, and Amazon's P/E is significantly higher. Combined, they have market caps in excess of $4 trillion.\n\nHowever, one important concept for investors to know is that a high price doesn't necessarily mean a stock is expensive. These are two proven winners with lots of future growth potential, and I wouldn't be surprised if both produced market-beating returns for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $578,143!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Huge Artificial Intelligence (AI) News for 3 Tech Companies This Week -- None of Which Are Named Nvidia",
        "content": "When people think of artificial intelligence (AI), they gravitate to graphics processing unit (GPU) chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- and rightly so. Nvidia currently has a huge lead making the chips needed for today's most advanced AI applications.\n\nBut AI benefits will offer growth opportunities for lots of tech companies that haven't seen their stocks run as far and fast as Nvidia.\n\nOn that note, there was big AI news this week for three tech giants, including two which aim to compete with Nvidia head-on.\n\nArm says it will begin making its own AI chips\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) went public last September in a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) that brought one of the two main semiconductor-architecture licensors to the market, with the other being the x86 architecture.\n\nToday, Arm is thriving, as use cases for its low-power chip architecture are proliferating. Revenue surged 47% last quarter on the back of strong licensing and royalty-revenue growth. That strong growth is not a surprise. Most cloud giants are gravitating toward the Arm architecture as they begin to design their own low-cost central processing unit (CPU) chips for their proprietary cloud offerings. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) uses Arm-based CPUs for its Grace CPUs that attach to their Grace-Hopper and Grace-Blackwell superchips, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) just introduced its own data-center CPU chip called Axion.\n\nHowever, Arm isn't getting to the meat of the AI revolution, as it doesn't license its architecture for the GPU accelerators that are at the heart of AI processing.\n\nBut management is looking to change that. According to a recent report from Nikkei Asia, Arm is now looking to design its own AI accelerators, which it will introduce in 2025. According to the report, Arm will invest heavily in initial development costs, which it should be able to bear as Arm has about $3 billion in cash on the balance sheet as well as a highly cash-generative core licensing business. The report says it will outsource production to a third-party foundry, perhaps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nSo, Nvidia will have some increased competition, which may be why Nvidia attempted to buy Arm years ago.\n\nStill, this may be a case of Arm being a bit late to the game in a crowded field. Virtually every cloud giant is now designing its own accelerators. And while Nvidia has a strong lead in \"neutral\" AI GPUs, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are each producing better and better \"neutral\" competitors.\n\nArm is 90% owned by Softbank(OTC: SFTB.Y), which is owned by the ambitious tech executive Masayoshi Son. Softbank had extended itself at the tail end of the tech-software bubble in 2021, so Arm investors must hope this isn't another example of \"me too\" thinking with a too-late entry into a red-hot tech sector. They'd be right to have mixed feelings about this week's announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle introduces new Trillium chips\n\nSpeaking of Google parent Alphabet, the search and cloud giant held its input/output (I/O) developer conference earlier this week. Unsurprisingly, there were numerous announcements related to AI, including the introduction of the aforementioned Axion CPU. But perhaps most notable on the AI chipmaking front was the announcement of Google's newest version of its tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator.\n\nGoogle has been making its TPUs since 2013 but only offers them through its Google Cloud platform. Of course, Google also has a deep stock of Nvidia chips that customers can use as well, but every cloud giant is vying for having the best low-cost alternative that's proprietary to their platform.\n\nThat's why Google's announcement of Trillium, the sixth-generation TPU accelerator, was important this week. The new chip boasts a 4.7 times performance over the prior fifth-generation chip, while being 67% more energy efficient. The new chip is also adorned with a new third-generation SparseCore accelerator, with capacity to process double the high-bandwidth memory with double the interchip-connect bandwidth. This will allow the new TPUs to process larger models. Alphabet also announced the ability to string 256 Trillium GPUs together to make a Google-powered supercomputer as well. Google, Arm, and Oracle had big AI news this week. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe new hardware will be behind a slew of new AI services Google introduced at the conference, including an update of its Gemini 1.5 pro model, the large language model (LLM) that competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT and others. But Google also introduced new specialized models for specific-use cases, including Veo, for high-definition video, Imagen 3 for text-to-image capabilities, and AI Sandbox, a music and sound-generation tool.\n\nFinally, Google Search is also getting an AI-powered upgrade launching this coming Monday. Complex Google queries will now display AI-generated summaries and multistep plans for relevant searches. The new search summaries are good efforts by Google to avoid getting disrupted by aspiring search alternatives such as ChatGPT-powered Bing or start-ups like Perplexity.\n\nAnd recent results imply Google's AI capabilities may be gaining traction, with its cloud platform reaccelerating to a 28.4% revenue growth last quarter and Search posting impressive 14.4% in its own right even up against aspiring disruptors.\n\nOracle lands a big fish for its cloud\n\nWhen it comes to cloud infrastructure, many think of the big-three cloud platforms. But investors may not want to ignore database giant Oracle(NYSE: ORCL), which has been making efforts to fashion itself as a fourth cloud alternative. Oracle's infrastructure revenue only amounted to $1.8 billion last quarter, which was still far behind third-place Google at $9.6 billion. However, Oracle's infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenue also grew at 49%, the highest rate among cloud giants.\n\nWhile it's easier to grow off a small base, those aspirations got a big boost earlier this week. According to The Information, Elon Musk's AI start-up xAI has been discussing a deal with Oracle cloud to rent its servers for AI processing in an amount up to $10 billion over \"a number of years.\" Given that Oracle's cloud is currently on a $7.2 billion annualized run rate, that would be a big deal, making xAI one of Oracle's largest cloud customers.\n\nOne may wonder how a mere start-up can afford such largesse, but Reuters also reports that Musk's cache has led xAI to fundraising talks of up to $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation. xAI, whose chatbot Grok aims to take on Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, will have a unique angle with access to data gleaned from X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as visual data from Tesla vehicles.\n\nElon Musk has built successful businesses like Tesla and SpaceX from scratch before, although his takeover of Twitter has been much more dubious. Still, if xAI turns into a big-time LLM, it appears Oracle will reap a lot of the benefits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Major indices continue to climb Despite ongoing concerns over sticky inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical tensions. Many shares defy the traditional “sell in May and go away” adage. This trend leaves investors wondering which stocks to buy to ride the ongoing surge in equities.\n\nStudies show that the S&P 500 Index has enjoyed 27 bull markets between 1928 and 2023, with an average gain of nearly 115% over an average period of 2.7 years. From 1987 to 2000, the longest bull market achieved an impressive gain of 582%. In June 2023, the S&P 500 re-entered bull market territory, displaying strong momentum. Research provider CFRA recently raised its 12-month target to over 5,600, citing optimistic profit growth expectations.\n\nAlthough concerns persist about high valuations in the technology sector and the potential volatility surrounding the presidential election in November, market sentiment remains positive. Anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and earnings growth could create a favorable environment for further gains. Let’s explore three of the best stocks to buy, poised to benefit from the current market momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) provides medications across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including diabetes, cancer and chronic pain. Its strong product portfolio, consistent revenue growth, and potential for future breakthroughs make LLY stock the first name on our stock list.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Eli Lilly reported a remarkable 26% increase in revenue, primarily driven by the successful launch of new products like Mounjaro and Zepbound. Wall Street has been impressed with the pharma company’s ability to innovate and effectively bring new products to market.\n\nMeanwhile, its gross margin also saw an impressive rise from 78.4% in the first quarter of 2023 to 82.5% in the first quarter of this year. Eli Lilly benefited from higher prices and an improved product mix, underscoring the company’s operational efficiency and pricing power. Operating income in the same period grew by 63%, and earnings per share increased by 59%. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $42.4 billion and $43.6 billion. The company also anticipates further margin expansion.\n\nAs a result, LLY stock has advanced 30% year-to-date (YTD), hovering slightly below all-time highs. Yet, the shares are expensive, trading at 56 times forward earnings and 19 times sales. Nonetheless, Wall Street is expecting further gains from the pharma stock, as the 12-month average price stands at $877.50, presenting an upside potential of 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet (FN) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on our list of stocks to buy is Fabrinet (NYSE:FN). Its equipment enables the transmission of massive data volumes at high speeds. With data demand constantly rising and a wide range of services ranging from optical packaging to precision manufacturing, Fabrinet deserves your attention as a long-term investment.\n\nAnalysts point out that Fabrinet has demonstrated robust financial health with a market cap of $8.4 billion. In early May, management released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Exceeding guidance, quarterly revenue was $731.5 million, compared to $665.3 million for the same period 12 months ago. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $2.39, compared to $1.94 for the year-ago quarter.\n\nWall Street was pleased about the growth in optical communications revenues, particularly from datacom revenue, which grew 150% YOY. Management is optimistic about its position in the high data rate datacom market. Fabrinet’s operating and net profit margins currently stand at 9.6 and 9.9%, respectively. In other words, management has successfully navigated the competitive manufacturing landscape to maintain profitability.\n\nSince the start of the year, FN stock has returned 22%, rallying significantly after announcing better-than-expected financial results. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 26.2 times forward earnings and 3.1 times sales. Given the extent of the recent rally in Fabrinet shares, potential investors may consider waiting for a pullback towards the $220 level. Fabrinet will likely continue its growth trajectory in future quarters, making it a compelling stock to buy within the tech manufacturing sector.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) Blocks that spell out ETF in front of jar with money and change.\n\nSource: SHUN_J / Shutterstock\n\nLarge-cap growth stocks typically thrive in rapidly expanding industries like technology and biotech. Known for high growth rates and valuations, these companies are expected to outpace other established stocks. Such growth shares may offer a blend of stability and significant long-term potential, making them an important part of many portfolios.\n\nTherefore, the Vanguard Growth ETF is next on our list of stocks to buy (NYSEARCA:VUG). This fund allows investors to replicate the performance of leading large-cap U.S. growth stocks. Launched in January 2004, the ETF offers broad exposure to about 200 companies.\n\nOver half of VUG’s holdings are in technology stocks (56%), followed by consumer discretionary (19%), industrials (9%) and healthcare (8%) sectors. The top 10 holdings collectively account for over half of the fund’s net assets of $226 billion. Among the top names are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Visa (NYSE:V) and others.\n\nSince January, with a gain of over 11%, VUG has outperformed many individual stocks and the benchmark indices. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 10%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 5%. Currently, the VUG fund trades at 38 times trailing earnings and 10 times book value. With a competitive expense ratio of 0.04% and a modest 0.5% dividend yield, VUG remains an appealing option for investors seeking exposure to large-cap growth stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOG) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.6%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.1%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 12.7% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Tech giants Microsoft MSFT, Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta META have reported massive investments in artificial intelligence and cloud computing in their latest earnings reports.\n\nThe AI boom has driven a surge in demand for data center capacity to handle AI workloads and store the vast amounts of data they require. Data centers are energy-intensive, and AI applications consume even more energy than traditional computing.\n\nMany tech giants have pledged to use renewable energy to power their data centers, driven by sustainability goals. And they are increasingly exploring nuclear energy for their power needs.\n\nGovernments around the world have also recognized that nuclear energy might be one of their key options in achieving their net-zero emissions targets.\n\nUranium, mainly used in nuclear power plants, is one of the most carbon-free ways to generate electricity. However, nuclear energy currently accounts for only about 10% of global electricity generation and about 20% in developed countries, including the US.\n\nWhile demand for uranium continues to rise, supply faces many challenges. Expanding the uranium supply will take a long time.\n\nPresident Biden yesterday signed a bill banning the import of Russian enriched uranium, which includes some waivers allowing imports until 2028 if no alternative source is found.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL unveiled a new notifications feature in Google Contacts, allowing users to view their call and message notifications on widgets.\r\n\r\nThe notifications widget comes with a badged bell icon in the top-right corner, joining background images and shortcuts for calling and messaging.\r\n\r\nUsers can now receive prompts that enable them to quickly respond to their recent messages from Google Contacts.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction across Android users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nMore on Google Contacts\n\nApart from the notifications widget, the company also updated Google Contacts for Android with a new \"Organize\" tab. The new interface includes tools like \"Google\" for easy contact management, reminders, emergency contacts, family group settings, household contacts, contact restore, and trash for deleted accounts.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is also preparing a new page for adding a new contact in Google Contacts. This page is intended to simplify the adding contact process by hiding fields not used on all contacts. The new page requires a name, company, and phone number, with additional fields like email, significant date, address, and notes.\r\n\r\nThe company added another update to Google Contacts, which now offers a dedicated section for setting and managing custom contact ringtones on Android devices. The \"Contact ringtones\" section, located under the \"Fix & Manage\" tab, also allows users to change and import ringtones.\r\n\r\nAlphabet unveiled a new section for \"Connected apps\" under the main contact information in Google Contacts, allowing messages, voice, and video calls with apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Google Meet.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will further bolster its Android offerings.

The figure has been revised upward by 11.8% in the past 60 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Salesforce CRM, CrowdStrike CRWD and Intuit INTU, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "title": "Does Reddit's (RDDT) OpenAI Partnership Make It Worth Buying?",
        "content": "Reddit RDDT shares jumped 11.74% in after-hours trading on May 16, following the announcement of its partnership with Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI.\r\n\r\nThe deal will bring Reddit content to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other products and, at the same time, will help the social media company incorporate new AI-powered features into its forums. OpenAI will also become Reddit’s advertising partner.\r\n\r\nSince its initial public offering in March, Reddit shares have gained 22.6%, outperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector.\n\nReddit’s Data Trove Makes It Invaluable for LLM Training\n\nReddit’s huge data trove makes it an invaluable source for big techs like Alphabet GOOGL division Google, Amazon AMZN and Microsoft for training their large language models (LLMs). LLMs form the base of Generative AI applications.\r\n\r\nGenerative AI and AI-related startups like OpenAI have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup’s AI innovations. Another startup, Anthropic, raised close to $2 billion and $4 billion from investors led by Alphabet’s division Google and Amazon, respectively, as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.\r\n\r\nOpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, and Google DeepMind’s Gemini Ultra are the three most capable tools currently available in the Generative AI domain.\n\nReddit Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Reddit Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nReddit Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Reddit Inc. Quote\n\nHowever, OpenAI and Anthropic are facing increasing competition from their original backers — Microsoft, Amazon and Google, respectively — as these big techs plan to build their own LLMs primarily because these are cheaper to build in-house and they can exercise more control on how to use the models. The OpenAI deal is expected to give them a glimpse of the potency of RDDT’s data in training their models.\r\n\r\nReddit’s partnership with Google, which involves training the latter’s LLMs, has been a game changer. An expanded partnership in February this year made it easier for users to find, discover and engage in content and communities on Reddit that are most relevant to them.\r\n\r\nRDDT is already benefiting from growing data licensing deals as other revenues surged more than 450% year over year to $20 million in the first quarter of 2024. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s prospects are supported by strong ad revenue growth expectations driven by an expanding user base. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nReddit currently has a Zacks Momentum Score of A, which makes it further attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\nUser-Friendly Steps, Ad Revenue Growth Aid Prospects\n\nGoogle is playing an important role in expanding its user base as it is getting better at displaying RDDT’s content. In first-quarter 2024, Daily Active Uniques (“DAUq”) increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Logged-in DAUq: Global, which RDDT considers as the core metrics of the business, jumped 27% year over year to 43.1 million in the reported quarter.\r\n\r\nReddit’s focus on making the platform faster and more user-friendly is noteworthy. It continues to invest in AI and machine learning to improve relevance, engagement and moderation. RDDT plans to deploy its own trained LLMs to improve moderation. These initiatives are expected to drive user engagement.\r\n\r\nReddit’s plan to monetize its platform through the launch of a revamped version of user awards and Reddit Gold (its virtual currency) bodes well for its future prospects.\r\n\r\nIts focus on reducing campaign setup time for self-serve and small and medium businesses (SMBs), as well as the launch of free formats, which provide advertisers with a versatile and creative format to drive deeper engagement with users, is expected to drive ad revenues.\r\n\r\nReddit Pro, a free suite of AI-powered insights and tools, is currently in beta with more than 1000 businesses, including Taco Bell, Wendy’s, NFL, the Wall Street Journal, as well as several SMBs. Shopping also remains on the horizon, with RDDT launching shopping ads and testing dynamic product ads.\n\nConclusion\n\nReddit’s user-friendly and advertiser-friendly focus is a key catalyst. Upcoming user interface improvements, better on-platform search capabilities and monetization plans provide strong growth opportunities. RDDT plans to grow revenues twice as fast as cost growth over the long term, which surely makes the stock attractive for investors at its current level.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "On May 15, U.S. stock markets soared following the release of two key economic data. Market participants’ confidence in risky assets like equities was boosted as expectations of the first reduction in the Fed fund rate in September heightened.\n\nLighter-Than-Expected CPI\n\nThe Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for the month of April rose 0.3% month-over-month, below the consensus estimate and March’s reading of 0.4%. Year over year, CPI increased 3.4%, in line with expectations.\n\nThe core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.3% month-over-month in April, after rising 0.4% in the previous three months. April’s data showed the smallest monthly increase since December 2023. Year over year, core CPI increased 3.6%, marking the lowest monthly increase since April 2021.\n\nWeak Retail Sales\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in April remained flat month over month, missing the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%. The reading for March was also revised downward to 0.6% from 0.7% reported earlier. However, year over year, retail sales increased 3% in April.\n\nCore retail sales (excluding auto) rose 0.2% month over month in April, in line with the consensus estimate. The metric for March was revised downward to 0.9% from 1.1% reported earlier.\n\nU.S. Economy is Cooling\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6% annualized rate in first-quarter 2024, well below the consensus estimate of 2.5%. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that both manufacturing and services PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) contracted in April. Weak retail sales and lower-than-expected CPI data are also in line with this trend.\n\nExpectations of Interest Rate Cut\n\nFollowing the release of CPI and retail sales data, the CME FedWatch shows a 73.2% probability that the Fed will reduce the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in September. The interest rate derivative tool is also showing a 94.5% probability that the central bank will reduce the interest rate by at least 50 basis points by the end of 2024. Notably, the Fed fund rate is currently at its 23-year high in the range of 5.25-5.5%.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have provided more than 20% returns year to date with more upside left. The companies have a robust business model, a strong financial position and a globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nMoreover, these stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s GOOGL first-quarter results were driven by a solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive. Also, the strength in YouTube favored the stock. Notably, a robust cloud division remains the key catalyst for GOOGL.\n\nExpanding data centers will continue to bolster GOOGL’s presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. GOOGL’s deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is also a positive.\n\nAlphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.1% and 30.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.7% over the last seven days. The stock price of GOOGL has rallied 24.7% year to date.\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics spaces.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 75.6% and 86.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 90.6% year to date.\n\nNetflix Inc. NFLX added 9.33 million paid subscribers globally in first-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\n\nNetflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 52.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.3% over the last 30 days. The stock price of NFLX has surged 25.4% year to date.\n\nThe Progressive Corp. PGR continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for PGR’s growth.\n\nPolicies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.\n\nThe Progressive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.2% and 84.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.6% over the last 30 days. The stock price of PGR has jumped 30% year to date.\n\nWells Fargo & Co.’s WFC first-quarter 2024 results show improvement in non-interest income and a decline in provisions. Progress on efficiency initiatives, such as branch footprint reduction, will continue to support expense reduction and drive WFC’s bottom line.\n\nA decent deposit balance will keep supporting WFC’s financials, given the strength in the consumer banking and lending segment, and aid its liquid profile. Additionally, WFC’s strong liquidity position will support its capital distribution activities.\n\nWells Fargo has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2% and 9.7%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the last 30 days. The stock price of WFC has climbed 24.1% year to date.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Time for Cloud ETFs on Earnings Strength &amp; Promising Growth?",
        "content": "Cloud computing has been at the forefront of the growth in technology for the past few years, offering efficient solutions for businesses and consumers. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow from $626.4 billion in 2023 to $1.27 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 15.1%, per MarketsandMarkets.\n\nThe widespread adoption of remote work and e-commerce has continued to fuel the need for scalable and reliable cloud solutions. Moreover, advancements in cloud technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and cybersecurity enhancements, have expanded the use cases for cloud services, attracting a broader customer base.\n\nThe global cloud computing market is led by three mega cloud service providers — Microsoft, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. The total cloud infrastructure market was worth $76 billion worldwide at the end of Q1 of 2024, which marked a year-over-year rise of 21%.\n\nAccording to recent data from Synergy Research Group cited on CRN, AWS, Microsoft and Google collectively managed a 67% share of the $76 billion global cloud infrastructure services market in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN recently reported their quarterly financial cloud numbers for the first quarter of 2024. Each company logged record quarterly cloud sales thanks to double-digit growth rates.\n\nInside Mega Cloud’s Size in Q1\n\nCombined, these three cloud leaders generated more than $61 billion in total sales in the first quarter of 2024. Their cloud units, in fact, boosted total revenue growth as clients are increasingly adopting AI services. Growth rates are rebounding from the relative lows seen through most of 2023.\n\nIndividually, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business generated $26.7 billion in total sales (up 21% year over year) during the quarter, meaning Microsoft’s cloud group now has a run rate of $107 billion.\n\nAWS generated just over $25 billion in revenues (up 17% year over year). This means Amazon’s cloud business now has an annual run rate of $100 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud reported total sales of $9.6 billion (up 28% year over year). This shows that Alphabet’s cloud business currently has an annual run rate of $38.4 billion.\n\nIn terms of global market share, AWS is leading (with a 31% share), followed by Microsoft (25%) and Google (11%). Other cloud market-share leaders of the first quarter included Alibaba BABA at 4% market share and Salesforce CRM at 3% cloud share.\n\nOther Companies’ Soaring Cloud Demand\n\nAlibaba’s revenues from Cloud Intelligence Group grew 3% year over yeardespite slashing prices in the first quarter. Like Alibaba, Baidu BIDU also came up with upbeat results thanks to the boom in AI Cloud revenue. Baidu’s AI Cloud Group revenues grew by 12% year over year, driven by generative AI and foundation models, which Baidu looks to strengthen further.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Growth in 2024\n\nAccording to Gartner Forecasts, global end-user spending on public cloud services is forecast will grow 20.4% to $678.8 billion in 2024, up from $563.6 billion in 2023. All segments of the cloud market are expected to see growth in 2024. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is forecast to experience the highest end-user spending growth in 2024 at 26.6%, followed by platform-as-a-service (PaaS) at 21.5%.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nWisdomtree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD, Global X Cloud Computing ETF CLOU, Amplify Global Cloud Technology ETF IVES, Fidelity Cloud Computing ETF FCLD and Cloud Computing ETF First Trust SKYY are some of the ETFs that can be played on the boom. All these ETFs have gained in the range of 4% to 5% in the past week.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Datadog, Garmin, Salesforce and CrowdStrike",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 17, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nBet on These 5 Top Tech Stocks Amid Cooling Inflation\n\nWall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024.\n\nThe CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024.\n\nCooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday.\n\nInvestors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements.\n\nLower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects.\n\nIn addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals.\n\nGrowth Factors Driving Technology Stocks\n\nThe growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncreasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies.\n\nGrowing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.\n\nTechnical advancements in Internet infrastructure and the accelerated deployment of 5G technology worldwide are tailwinds. IoT-supported industrial automation, rising PC shipment and\r\ngrowing demand for smart electric appliances, wearables, electric vehicles and drones are other positives.\n\nGiven this booming scenario, it is prudent for investors to place bets on tech companies such as Alphabet, Datadog, Garmin, Salesforce and CrowdStrike for superb returns.\n\nThese stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from growing generative AI capabilities. It is cashing in on the increasing demand for LLMs with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Its Google division is gaining from solid momentum in the cloud business. Expanding data centers and strengthening its generative AI-backed cloud portfolio are positives. Google’s improving search engine, on the back of major search updates, and strength in YouTube remain the key catalysts. Alphabet’s deepening focus on the wearables category and expanding presence in the autonomous driving space are other positives.\n\nGOOGL has gained 42.7% over a year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.8% to $7.57 per share in the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nDatadog is benefiting from strength in customer demand for offerings in modern observability, cloud security, software delivery and cloud service management. The solid adoption of its cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform, owing to the accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration across organizations, remains a plus. Further, a solid cloud partner base, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, is contributing well to its financial performance. The company is witnessing strong customer momentum due to its significant investments in sales and marketing to engage customers, increase brand awareness and drive the adoption of its platform and products.\n\nDatadog has gained 29.8% in the past year. It currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 8.5% to $1.54 per share in the past 60 days.\n\nGarmin is gaining from strong momentum in its Fitness segment, owing to solid demand for its advanced wearables. Also, its expanding adventure watch portfolio is driving its momentum among adventure enthusiasts. Strength in its OEM product categories is benefiting the company’s performance in the aviation industry. In addition, Garmin’s expanding footprint in the automotive space remains a tailwind. Its strong relationship with BMW on the back of its robust domain controllers is a positive.\n\nGarmin has gained 65.7% in the past year. It currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.5% to $5.58 per share in the past 60 days.\n\nSalesforce is gaining from a strong demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line. Continued deal wins in the international market are other growth drivers. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration software and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. Salesforce’s strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings remains a plus.\n\nSalesforce has gained 37.3% in the past year. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 0.3% to $9.71 per share in the past 60 days.\n\nCrowdStrike is benefiting from the solid demand for cyber-security solutions due to a slew of data breaches, and the increasing need for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. Continued digital transformation and cloud migration strategies adopted by organizations are key growth drivers. The company’s portfolio strength, mainly the Falcon platform’s 10 cloud modules, boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. Additionally, strategic acquisitions, such as Bionic and Reposify, remain noteworthy.\n\nCrowdStrike has gained 150% in the past year. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 0.5% to $3.90 per share in the past 60 days.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Netflix's NFL deal highlights streamer's 'natural evolution' as sports rights take center stage",
        "content": "Netflix's (NFLX) surprise three-season deal with the NFL marks a major shift for the streaming giant, which has historically avoided traditional live sports investments.\n\nAs part of the deal, the platform will stream two Christmas Day games: the Pittsburgh Steelers taking on the Kansas City Chiefs, followed by a matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans.\n\nSome on Wall Street view the move as more of an experiment for Netflix, with streaming platforms pressured to expand their offerings, especially amid the recent introduction of advertising tiers.\n\n\"I think this is much more about testing the waters, learning how to do advertising inside of sports,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet told Yahoo Finance, arguing the NFL won't necessarily help the streamer retain subscribers over the long term.\n\n\"Down the road, [Netflix will] presumably bid on more sports rights and do more advertising,\" he surmised. \"I think it's a good thing. It's just a natural evolution of the business.\"\n\nThe deal comes as the NFL has been adding more streaming services as media partners. The list also includes Amazon's Prime Video (AMZN) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA). And Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in note to clients he believes the games will help offer a boost to Netflix's ad tier and enable the company to \"actively promote\" its own content during the games.\n\nNetflix — which will reportedly pay less than $150 million per game, according to Bloomberg — will also bring large global distribution to the NFL, according to Anmuth.\n\n\"Last year’s 3 NFL Christmas Day games ranked among the top 25 most viewed TV programs in 2023. With the partnership spanning 3 years, we believe NFLX could deepen its relationship with the NFL, especially as the league looks to further diversify its distribution strategy & we would expect more live sports over time,\" he wrote.\n\nJefferies agreed, writing in a research note following the news, \"We are positive on the NFL deal, which we believe will create a compelling value proposition for NFLX's emerging ad business.\"\n\n\"This would represent NFLX's biggest foray into fully unscripted live sports content,\" the bank said, calling the deal terms \"highly attractive\" given that the company has previously spent similar amounts on original movies such as \"The Gray Man and \"Red Notice.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n'Live sports is a game changer'\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for media giants as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable or streaming service fee to access sports over other types of content.\n\n\"This foray by Netflix into live sports is a game changer for the company,\" Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. \"The immediacy of live events is what makes it such a draw for audiences. ... Many people are already going over the top and cutting the cord and watching all kinds of content on streaming. Sports is the natural next step in that evolution.\"\n\nNetflix had previously maintained that it wanted to focus on \"sports entertainment\" instead of paying for the rights to live sports, which can be expensive for media companies.\n\nIn the past, the company has released docuseries and sports-adjacent content like \"The Quarterback,\" \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive,\" \"Full Swing,\" and \"Break Point,\" in addition to live sporting events like the \"Netflix Cup\" celebrity golf tournament, which aired late last year.\n\nOne recently announced partnership seemed to deviate from that status quo. In January, Netflix announced a 10-year deal with TKO Group Holding's WWE (TKO) that will bring WWE’s flagship program Raw, a live wrestling production, to the streaming service beginning in 2025.\n\nIt also announced a live-streaming boxing event in July between YouTuber Jake Paul and heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.

        "title": "Meet the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Makes Up 22% of Billionaire Bill Ackman's $11 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "When it comes to investing, hedge funds generally have a bad reputation -- and for good reason. A report released by The American Enterprise Institute a few years ago helps illustrate why. An analysis of hedge fund returns between 2011 and 2020 found that the S&P 500beat the average hedge fund's return every single year, and usually by a wide margin. In fact, during that 10-year stretch, hedge funds returned roughly 5%, on average, compared to 14.4% gains for the S&P 500.\n\nHowever, not all hedge fund managers are cut from the same cloth. Billionaire Bill Ackman has developed a reputation for being a different breed of hedge fund manager. He doesn't trade in and out of stocks every quarter in an attempt to buttress his performance. He generally buys high-quality North American companies with limited downside that generate predictable, recurring cash flows. At any given time, he has between eight and 12 stocks, and holds them for the long term.\n\nAckman helms Pershing Square Capital Management -- the hedge fund he founded -- which had $10.8 billion in assets under management to close out the first quarter. His investing strategy has been extremely successful: Pershing Square has returned 31% annualized over the past five years, nearly twice the returns of the S&P 500 and vastly outperforming the industry.\n\nTo close out the first quarter, the hedge owned stakes in just six companies, but one major artificial intelligence (AI) player is Ackman's largest holding. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy Ackman singled out Alphabet\n\nAckman has a long track record of buying stocks and holding them for years, and there's not a lot of turnover in Pershing Square's holdings. So, when Ackman adds a new stock to the fold, it tends to attract a lot of attention. That's what happened in early 2023, when Pershing Square added Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) to its portfolio. The hedge fund holds 9.4 million Class C shares and 4.3 million Class A shares worth a combined total of nearly $2.4 billion, accounting for 22% of Pershing Square's total portfolio.\n\nJust six companies make up Pershing Square's $11 billion portfolio, so a stock must represent a compelling opportunity in order to make the cut. Fortunately, we don't need to guess as to why Ackman singled out Alphabet.\n\nAckman noted that at the time, Alphabet stock was selling for just 15 times earnings. This marked its lowest multiple in more than a decade and near its lowest valuation ever.\n\nThe purchase came on the heels of the worst advertising slump in more than a decade, which helped push down the stock's valuation. The economic downturn and the resulting bear market saw marketing demand dry up as businesses sought to retain precious capital and shore up their financial positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022 -- just before Ackman took his initial stake -- Alphabet's revenue grew just 1% year over year, while its advertising revenue fell 4%. It's always darkest before the dawn, or so the saying goes, and Ackman was clearly on to something.\n\nAlphabet's advertising revenue turned the corner shortly after that and has been improving ever since. In the first quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew 15% year over year and 16% in constant currency, while advertising revenue rose 13%. At the same time, its diluted earnings per share soared 62%. Ackman also pointed to Google Search and YouTube as \"two of the highest return and most resilient digital ad formats.\"\n\nLet's not forget Google Cloud, Alphabet's \"Big Three\" cloud platform. It's the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider, and it's gaining ground on No. 1 Amazon Web Services.\n\nAckman also noted there were \"misplaced concerns over the company's AI positioning.\" Recent events have helped to put those concerns to rest.\n\nJust this week, Alphabet hosted the Google I/O 2024 Developers Conference, unleashing a tidal wave of AI-related announcements. Many of its most recent AI innovations directly benefit Google Search, ensuring it maintains its industry dominance for years to come. The company also debuted new high-end AI processors, unveiled its vision for the future of AI assistants, and introduced the latest version of its Gemini large language model (LLM), which underpins the company's AI systems.\n\nAckman noted that Alphabet has been investing in AI for years and its leadership is undeniable. \"AI is deeply embedded in and will continue to enhance applications, including Search and 14 other products with over 500 million users each,\" he wrote.\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy now?\n\nSince its IPO (as Google) in 2004, the stock has generated returns of 8,083% (as of this writing). This isn't just in the distant past; Alphabet stock has gained 50% over the past year.\n\nAs a result of the rebound in Alphabet's stock price, it isn't the screaming buy it was just a couple of years ago. That said, Alphabet is still attractively priced, selling for 26 times earnings, a discount to the multiple of 28 for the S&P 500.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet has a long history of outpacing the returns of the broader market. Over the past 10 years, the stock has soared 559%, more than triple the 183% gains of the S&P 500.\n\nThe company's long track record of execution and its strong position in AI make Alphabet stock a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google in a court filing on Thursday is seeking a non-jury trial in the U.S. Justice Department's lawsuit accusing the advertising and search giant of anticompetitive practices in the online advertising marketplace.\n\nThe Justice Department, which filed the advertising lawsuit in January 2023, alleged the company has abused its dominance of the digital advertising business and argued that it should be forced to sell its ad manager suite.\n\nGoogle said the Justice Department's request for a jury trial breaks \"with all historical precedent\" and noted the department itself has said the technical nature might be difficult for a prospective juror to understand.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle’s online advertising network, which includes ad manager, brought in 12% of the company’s revenue in 2021 and also plays a vital role in the search engine and cloud company's overall sales.\n\nGoogle has said the Justice Department's case went \"beyond the boundaries of antitrust law,\" saying it does not regulate the internet company's conduct at issue.\n\n(Reporting by Chris Sanders; Editing by Sonali Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(0:30) - Breaking Down The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting (5:30) - Top Takeaways From Warren Buffett (17:10) - Stocks To Keep On Your Watchlist: Invest Like Buffett (34:00) - Episode Roundup: GOOGL, SONY, UNP, V, MA Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #369 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\n93-year-old Warren Buffett hosted another Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting on May 4, 2024 in Omaha. It is the biggest annual gathering of value investors in the world.\n\nThankfully, if you aren’t a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder, you can now watch the event “live” on CNBC. CNBC also does interviews with some of the Berkshire Hathaway company CEOs during the lunch break.\n\nIt’s a multi-hour question and answer session with Berkshire shareholders. And even though this year was a tribute to Buffett’s right-hand-man, Charlie Munger, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 99, there was still plenty of Buffett’s typical folksy advice.\n\nHe always makes investing seem so easy to navigate.\n\nThe Best Tips from the Annual Meeting\n\nSome of Buffett’s most interesting comments at the meeting don’t always have to do with investing. Many are just about life. Here are some of the notes Tracey scribbled while watching the Q&A.\n\nThese are three of the best tips.\n\n1.       Compounding is one of the most important factors in investing.\n\n2.       Read top books, like Ben Graham’s the Intelligent Investor, several times.\n\n3.       The deficit is not keeping him up at night.\n\n5 Stocks That are Berkshire Hathaway Approved\n\nBerkshire was sitting on $182 billion in cash as of the annual meeting. What stocks are Buffett-like that he could buy, or buy more, of?\n\n1. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet fits the mold of a Berkshire stock. It has moats and plenty of free cash flow. Alphabet had $108.1 billion in cash as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nShares of Alphabet are near all-time highs, up 24.4% year-to-date. But it’s actually cheap on a historic basis and compared to the other Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\nAlphabet trades with a forward P/E of 22.8. It has a PEG ratio of just 1.3. A PEG under 1.0 usually indicates both value and growth. But 1.3 is still low.\n\nWill Berkshire Hathaway eventually buy shares of Alphabet?\n\n2. Sony Group Corp. (SONY)\n\nSony is a global powerhouse in gaming, cameras, chips, entertainment, and music. It has plenty of moats. In May 2024, Sony announced it was raising its dividend and would target a 40% total payout ratio by the end of Fiscal 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Sony are down 11.9% year-to-date. It’s cheap on P/E and P/B ratio levels. Sony’s forward P/E is just 14.5, which puts it as a value stock. It has a P/B ratio of only 2.0. A P/B ratio under 3.0 usually indicates value.\n\nBerkshire owns other Japanese companies. Will Sony be next?\n\n3. Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns one of the largest railroads in America with BNSF. But Buffett talked about how Berkshire almost bought Union Pacific instead. Union Pacific has paid a dividend for 125 consecutive years. That’s impressive.\n\nShares of Union Pacific are up just 0.1% year-to-date. But earnings are expected to rise 7.6% this year. Union Pacific has a forward P/E of 21.9.\n\nIf you want to own a railroad, Union Pacific is one to keep on your short list.\n\n4. Visa Inc. (V)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has owned shares of Visa since the third quarter of 2011. Visa is an earnings all-star. It hasn’t missed since it went IPO in 2008. Earnings are expected to rise 13.3% in fiscal 2024.\n\nShares of Visa are up just 7.5% year-to-date. It trades with a forward P/E of 28.3.\n\nShould value investors still be buying Visa in 2024?\n\n5. Mastercard Inc. (MA)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway also owns shares of Mastercard, which it bought before Visa, in the first quarter of 2011. Mastercard also has an outstanding earnings surprise track record with just 2 misses in the last 10 years.\n\nShares of Mastercard are up 7.6% year-to-date. It trades with a forward P/E of 32.2, which is well above the classic “value” P/E level of 15.\n\nIs it too late for value investors to buy Mastercard?\n\nWhat Other Tidbits of Wisdom Did Buffett Drop at the Berkshire Annual Meeting?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI unveiled a partnership with Reddit Inc. that will bring the social network’s content to chatbot ChatGPT and other products, and allow Reddit to add new artificial intelligence features to its online communities.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US ‘Containment’ With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence Jamie Dimon Sees ‘Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us’ Dow Average Touches 40,000 Before Pulling Back: Markets Wrap\n\nReddit shares jumped 11% in late trading following the announcement.\n\nThe agreement “will enable OpenAI’s AI tools to better understand and showcase Reddit content, especially on recent topics,” the companies said Thursday in a joint statement. Reddit will also offer its users new AI-based tools built on OpenAI’s models, and OpenAI will become a Reddit advertising partner. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.\n\nReddit last week released new policies governing the use of its data, part of an effort to increase revenue through licensing agreements with artificial intelligence developers and other companies. The company, which sold shares in an initial public offering in March, also signed an accord in January with Alphabet Inc.’s Google worth $60 million to help train large language models, the technology underpinning generative AI. The San Francisco-based social network has signed licensing deals worth $203 million in total, with terms ranging from two to three years.\n\nOpenAI, for its part, is increasingly forging partnerships with media companies to help train its AI systems and show more real-time content within its chatbot. The ChatGPT maker also penned deals with Dotdash Meredith earlier this month and the Financial Times in April.\n\nSam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI, has a long history with Reddit — he was one of the company’s largest shareholders at the time of its IPO earlier this year, and briefly served as Reddit’s interim CEO in 2014. The companies noted in the statement that their partnership was led by OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap, and was approved by its independent directors.\n\nThe shares of Reddit, which had declined 5.5% to $56.38 in New York trading, soared as high as $64.75 after the partnership was announced. The stock has gained 66% since its IPO.\n\n(Updates with information on partnership starting in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’ How the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives The DNA Test Delusion Milei Targets Labor Law That’s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance Europe’s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google wants judge, not jury, decide upcoming antitrust case in Virginia",
        "content": "Google on Thursday asked that a judge, rather than a jury, decide whether it violated U.S. antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising.\n\nTo bolster its case, the tech giant wrote a multimillion-dollar check to the U.S. government that it says renders moot the government's best argument for demanding a jury trial.\n\nThe antitrust case set to go before a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, in September is one of two major lawsuits the Justice Department has brought against Google. While the Virginia case focuses on advertising technology, an ongoing case in the District of Columbia focuses on Google's dominance as a search engine.\n\nBoth sides in the D.C. case have presented evidence and made closing arguments. A judge there will decide whether Google violated the law.\n\nGoogle wants a judge to decide the merits of the case in Virginia, as well. The company argues in court papers filed Thursday that it's unprecedented for a jury to decide a federal antitrust case brought by the government. It says that this case in particular involves \"a complicated, intricate technology ecosystem, which DOJ has acknowledged to this Court is ‘highly technical, often abstract, and outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective jurors.’”\n\nA Department of Justice spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday evening.\n\nGoogle, based in Mountain View, California, makes two primary arguments for striking the government's demand for a jury trial. For starters, Google argues that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not apply to a civil suit brought by the government.\n\nThe right to a jury trial, based in the Bill of Rights, “protects citizens against the federal government, not the other way around,” Google's lawyers write in their court filing.\n\nThe company acknowledges in the court papers, though, that the Justice Department has a stronger argument for demanding a jury in a case where it seeks monetary damages, as opposed to merely seeking equitable relief, like forcing Google to sell off parts of its advertising technology.\n\nIn the Virginia case, the Department of Justice seeks monetary damages on behalf of federal agencies, including the Army, that it says were harmed by Google's monopolistic practices and overpaid for online ads that they purchased.\n\nIn its court filing, Google contends that the damage claim was tacked on to the lawsuit at the last minute for the sole purpose of allowing them to seek a jury.\n\nThe Department of Justice “manufactured a damages claim at the last minute in an attempt to secure a jury trial in a case even they describe as ‘highly technical’ and ‘outside the everyday knowledge of most prospective jurors,” the company said in a written statement Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle's filing Thursday said the company has cut a check to the government that is triple the amount of the losses the government can claim. The exact amount of the check is redacted, but in other court papers, Google said the maximum amount of damages the government was able to demonstrate during the discovery process was less than $1 million.\n\nBecause the law allows antitrust damages to be trebled, the check amount would be less than $3 million.\n\nGoogle says it still disputes that the damages are legitimate, but says that paying the government's claimed damages eliminates the need for a jury to decide the damages question.\n\nWhile Google says it's unprecedented for a jury to decide a government antitrust suit, Google has defended itself in front of a jury on antitrust cases brought by private companies.\n\nLast year, a jury in San Francisco ruled in favor of Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite game, in a case the company brought against Google over the Google Play store, which allows users of Android phones to download apps.\n\nIn that case, Google tried unsuccessfully at the last minute to switch the trial from a jury trial to a bench trial.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Snowflake Is in Talks to Buy Reka AI for $1 Billion",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc. is in talks to acquire startup Reka AI for more than $1 billion, expanding the software maker’s effort to offer generative AI capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US ‘Containment’ With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence Jamie Dimon Sees ‘Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us’ Dow Average Touches 40,000 Before Pulling Back: Markets Wrap\n\nReka AI makes large language models — software trained on massive swaths of the internet that can be used for a range of tasks, such as captioning images or as a customer-supported chatbots. The startup was founded in 2022 by researchers from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. It was valued at about $300 million in a 2023 investment round, which included funding from Snowflake’s venture arm, according to a Reuters report.\n\nSnowflake makes tools to organize and analyze data in the cloud and sees generative AI, which produces text, voice or images in response to users’ prompts, as an accelerant to its business. It released its own large language model, Arctic, in April. The company also lets customers use third-party AI models, such as those from Reka, on their data within Snowflake.\n\nThe discussions may not result in a deal, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. A Snowflake spokesperson declined to comment. Reka couldn’t be reached for comment.\n\nSridhar Ramaswamy, who had a decade-and-a-half tenure at Google, took the reins as Snowflake chief executive officer earlier this year. Ramaswamy was Snowflake’s senior vice president of AI before becoming the CEO. He joined the company last year when it acquired Neeva, an AI-powered search engine.\n\nShares of Snowflake have dropped 17% this year, lagging behind the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which has gained 3.3%. The company’s revenue growth slowed in 2023 after many businesses cut back on their software purchases. This trend, termed cost optimization, also affected cloud providers like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\nTechnology giants have rushed to partner or acquire startups working in the competitive field of generative AI. Microsoft has bankrolled OpenAI’s efforts and recently hired much of the staff of Inflection AI. Qualcomm Inc. is teaming up with semiconductor startup Ampere to work on AI-oriented chips. Salesforce Inc. has invested in multiple AI startups as it integrates the technology through its customer-oriented apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nDatabricks, a startup that is generally seen as Snowflake’s main competitor, has also released its own open-source large language model and last year acquired AI startup MosaicML for $1.3 billion. Databricks was valued at $43 billion in September, compared with Snowflake’s current market value of about $55 billion.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’ How the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives The DNA Test Delusion Milei Targets Labor Law That’s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance Europe’s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'Big Short' Investor Michael Burry Bets Heavy On Gold, Renewable Energy Stocks, Exits Amazon, Alphabet\n\nMichael Burry, the legendary investor who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis, has once again made headlines with his latest 13F filing for his hedge fund Scion Asset Management LLC.\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 reveals a strategic recalibration towards physical commodities and renewable energy, while Burry shifted away from some tech giants.\n\nThe total market value of Scion's 13F securities increased from $94.6 million to $103.49 million. The fund’s activity included five new purchases, additions to 11 existing positions, and complete sell-offs of 14 stocks.\n\nTop 5 Buys: A Golden Bet On Gold And Clean Energy\n\nBurry's top buys for Q1 2024 reveal a clear pivot towards physical precious metals and clean energy, underscoring his anticipation of rising value in these sectors.\n\nLeading the charge is the Sprott Physical Gold Trust ETV (NYSE:PHYS), with Scion increasing its position by $7.62 million, marking a 7.37% change in the portfolio. This substantial investment highlights Burry's confidence in gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty. The aforementioned gold fund has delivered a 16% return year to date, outperforming the broader stock market, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which rose by 12%.\n\nNext in line is Cigna Holding Co (NYSE:CL), where Scion increased its stake by $7.26 million, representing a 7.02% portfolio change. This move reflects Burry's continued belief in the resilience and growth potential of the healthcare sector.\n\nReflecting confidence in the energy sector, Burry added $6.59 million worth of BP Plc ADR (NYSE:BP), translating to a 6.37% portfolio change. This investment signifies Burry’s recognition of BP’s strong position in the global energy market, especially amid BP’s transition to cleaner energy sources.\n\nLast week, the British energy company’s electric vehicle charging unit announced plans to acquire Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) supercharging sites in the US as part of its expansion efforts.\n\nBurry's commitment to renewable energy is further emphasized by a $5.06 million increase in First Solar Inc. (NYSE:FSLR), representing a 4.89% change in the portfolio. This move aligns with the global shift towards sustainable energy solutions, showcasing Burry's foresight in capitalizing on this growing trend.\n\nRounding out the top five buys is Baidu Inc ADR (NASDAQ:BIDU), with a $4.38 million addition, marking a 4.07% portfolio change. This investment underscores Burry’s confidence in the long-term potential of Chinese technology companies.\n\nIn his Q4 2023 13F filing, Burry increased stakes in two major Chinese retail giants, JD.com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) and Alibaba Group Holdings (NASDAQ:BABA).\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of the first quarter 2024, Burry further increased his stakes in these two giants, purchasing an additional 160,000 shares of JD.com and 50,000 shares of Alibaba.\n\nTop 5 Portfolio Divestments: Burry Trims Tech Giants\n\nBurry made notable divestments in several high-profile tech stocks during the first quart.\n\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ:ORCL) tops the list, with Scion decreasing its holdings by $5.77 million, a 5.57% change in the portfolio.\n\nCVS Health Corp (CVS) followed closely, with a $5.62 million reduction, a 5.43% change in the portfolio. This move might reflect concerns over potential challenges in the healthcare sector.\n\nNexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) ranked third in terms of largest sales, with Burry reducing the stake by $5.57 million (5.39% change).\n\nNotably, Burry opted to completely exit his positions in two major U.S. tech giants, suggesting a reevaluation of their growth prospects following a strong rally.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a full divestment, with Burry selling $5.35 million worth of shares (a 5.17% change).\n\nSimilarly, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) experienced a complete exit, with a $4.99 million reduction, representing a 4.82% portfolio change. This move highlights Burry's cautious stance on the future performance of one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms.\n\nPortfolio Summary\n\nThe top five holdings by weight in the Scion Asset Management LLC’s portfolio by the end of the Q1 2024 are:\n\nJD.com Inc: 9.53%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd: by 8.74%. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA): 8.06%. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C): 7.64%.

        "title": "Bet on These Top 5 Technology Stocks Amid Cooling Inflation",
        "content": "Wall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024.\r\n\r\nThe CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024.\r\n\r\nCooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday. \r\n\r\nInvestors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements.\r\n\r\nLower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals.\n\nGrowth Factors Driving Technology Stocks\n\nThe growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots.\r\n\r\nIncreasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies.\r\n\r\nGrowing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.\r\n\r\nTechnical advancements in Internet infrastructure and the accelerated deployment of 5G technology worldwide are tailwinds. IoT-supported industrial automation, rising PC shipment and\r\ngrowing demand for smart electric appliances, wearables, electric vehicles and drones are other positives.\r\n\r\nGiven this booming scenario, it is prudent for investors to place bets on tech companies such as Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD for superb returns.\r\n\r\nThese stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne-Year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet is benefiting from growing generative AI capabilities. It is cashing in on the increasing demand for LLMs with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Its Google division is gaining from solid momentum in the cloud business. Expanding data centers and strengthening its generative AI-backed cloud portfolio are positives. Google’s improving search engine, on the back of major search updates, and strength in YouTube remain the key catalysts. Alphabet’s deepening focus on the wearables category and expanding presence in the autonomous driving space are other positives.\r\n\r\nGOOGL has gained 42.7% over a year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.8% to $7.57 per share in the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nDatadog is benefiting from strength in customer demand for offerings in modern observability, cloud security, software delivery and cloud service management. The solid adoption of its cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform, owing to the accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration across organizations, remains a plus. Further, a solid cloud partner base, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, is contributing well to its financial performance. The company is witnessing strong customer momentum due to its significant investments in sales and marketing to engage customers, increase brand awareness and drive the adoption of its platform and products.\r\n\r\nDatadog has gained 29.8% in the past year. It currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 8.5% to $1.54 per share in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nGarmin is gaining from strong momentum in its Fitness segment, owing to solid demand for its advanced wearables. Also, its expanding adventure watch portfolio is driving its momentum among adventure enthusiasts. Strength in its OEM product categories is benefiting the company’s performance in the aviation industry. In addition, Garmin’s expanding footprint in the automotive space remains a tailwind. Its strong relationship with BMW on the back of its robust domain controllers is a positive.\r\n\r\nGarmin has gained 65.7% in the past year. It currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.5% to $5.58 per share in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nSalesforce is gaining from a strong demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line. Continued deal wins in the international market are other growth drivers. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration software and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. Salesforce’s strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings remains a plus.\r\n\r\nSalesforce has gained 37.3% in the past year. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 0.3% to $9.71 per share in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is benefiting from the solid demand for cyber-security solutions due to a slew of data breaches, and the increasing need for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. Continued digital transformation and cloud migration strategies adopted by organizations are key growth drivers. The company’s portfolio strength, mainly the Falcon platform’s 10 cloud modules, boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. Additionally, strategic acquisitions, such as Bionic and Reposify, remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike has gained 150% in the past year. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 0.5% to $3.90 per share in the past 60 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's what 10 analysts have to say about Netflix ad tier",
        "content": "Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced Wednesday that it will team up with The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Display&Video 360, and ad-tech firm Magnite to accelerate automated ad buying. The company also made several other announcements as part of its Upfront 2024 press release.\n\nHere's how Wall Street analysts reacted:\n\nBMO Capital: \"Reiterate Outperform for TTD, our top SMID-cap pick, as a Netflix CTV demand partnership reinforces our view that TTD is best-positioned against a massive $150B linear TV opportunity shift towards connected TV.\"\n\nTruist: \"These partnerships were bound to happen in our view given Netflix's evolving ad platform, which is now at the point where it can scale materially with the scaling of users for its AVOD service.\"\n\nKeyBanc: \"As Netflix deepens its ad capabilities, we believe this could help support >10% annual revenue growth in 2025E and beyond.\"\n\nJPMorgan: \"NFLX announced that it will build an in-house ad tech platform by the end of 2025&expand its sales partnerships this summer to TTD, Google's Display&Video 360,&Magnite, in addition to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xandr. We believe today's announcements show solid progress in the multi-year journey toward a scaled advertising tier,&highlight NFLX˖s growing focus on differentiated live content.\"\n\nCiti: \"Netflix broadening its ad tech partners has been anticipated for some time, and with TTD's leadership in decisioned programmatic CTV, it was a clear partner choice. That said, with Netflix's premier positioning in CTV, our view is this is positive for TTD.\"\n\nJefferies: \"NFLX's decision to onboard new programmatic partners (e.g., TTD, GOOG, MGNI) represents a faster-than-expected transition of Connected TV ad sales from direct deals into biddable auctions. We believe this validates our view that there will be fewer Walled Gardens in CTV than there are in Search/Social.\"\n\nUBS: \"Along with the recent WWE deal, we believe the addition of NFL rights provide another lever to drive engagement, enhance pricing power and scale the company's ad business (while presenting another source of leakage for marquee programming out the traditional TV ecosystem).\"\n\nGuggenheim: \"Netflix will stream at least one NFL game globally on Christmas Day for the next three years, the streaming giant announced Wednesday, marking the company's biggest bet on live sports yet.\"\n\n\"We estimate a cost of $200-250mm for NFLX's NFL rights and ~$185mm in direct advertising revenue.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley: \"For OW NFLX, the disclosure of 40mm ad-supported global monthly active users is in line with our forecast, an increase from 23mm reached in early January. This is broadly consistent with the +65% ad membership growth QoQ reported with 1Q24 results.\"\n\nPiper Sandler: \"Netflix announced it will be adding Trade Desk as a programmatic partner this summer. While Netflix's advertising business is still scaling, we think the partnership should be a significant long-term opportunity for Trade Desk.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHere's what 10 analysts have to say about Netflix ad tier\n\nDow briefly tops 40,000 for first time ever, but rising Treasury yields cap gains\n\nEarnings call: Zealand Pharma reports solid Q1 results, advances in obesity treatment\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Shares Are Back to Winning Ways as AI Optimism Builds",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After months of struggles, Apple Inc. is looking a lot more like the stock market leader it used to be.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US ‘Containment’ Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market\n\nThe iPhone maker’s shares are on pace for their best month since March 2023. They’ve gained more than 11% after a strong earnings report showed growth is returning and the company also announced the biggest stock buyback in US history, a sign of its financial might.\n\nIn addition, there is growing excitement about its artificial intelligence plans. After being down as much as 14% this year, the stock is close to erasing those losses.\n\nThe latest leg of the rally came after a Bloomberg report that Apple is closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use ChatGPT features in the new iPhone operating system. That had greater resonance after OpenAI on Monday showed off a faster and cheaper version of the AI model that underpins ChatGPT, including a demonstration of new voice features.\n\nThe demo showed the potential for AI-infused digital assistants, and such features could juice revenue growth for Apple by compelling customers to buy new iPhones and pay for more services, according to Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management. He’s more convinced than ever that “AI will result in Siri on steroids,” he said.\n\n“A lot of the details of Apple’s AI strategy are still under wraps, but I think AI will produce a huge upgrade cycle, one of the biggest it has seen in some time,” said Mahoney.\n\nAn agreement with OpenAI is not yet official, and Apple also has held talks with Alphabet Inc. to build Google’s Gemini AI engine into the iPhone. Those talks are ongoing, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nGoogle unveiled new AI features of its own this week, in a demonstration that was seen as a positive sign of its own technological capabilities. Investors suggested a partnership with either could be positive for Apple.\n\nRead More: Google Introduces Generative AI in Search in Major Update\n\n“It doesn’t need to build things from the ground up, or make a huge investment in AI just to bring something to market,” Mahoney said. “Other companies have already done that work, and they’re all going to want to be on the iPhone.”\n\nA key event for Apple will come at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The company is expected to show off its next major software updates for the iPhone and other devices, where its new AI strategy will be front and center, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has been dogged this year by concerns about stagnating revenue growth amid sluggish sales of iPhones and weakness in China. Revenue fell 4% in Apple’s fiscal second quarter, the fifth contraction in the past six quarters. However, the Cupertino, California-based company projected that sales would increase by a percentage in the low single digits, raising hopes about future expansion.\n\nOf course, there’s still a lot of uncertainty, and at 27 times estimated earnings, Apple remains above its long-term average multiple at a time of tepid growth.\n\n“If Apple can’t recapture growth, then it is probably a bit expensive,” said Ryan Gorman, an independent analyst who was previously chief investment officer at Callesen Wealth Management.\n\n“A deal with either OpenAI or Alphabet would show that Apple is taking AI seriously,” he added. AI is “a feature you have to have to remain relevant, but does it really drive profits and revenue going forward? That remains to be seen.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTop Tech News\n\nMichael Burry’s investment firm doubled down on its bets on JD.com Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in the first quarter as Chinese equities bottomed out. When Microsoft Corp. pledged four years ago to remove more carbon than it emits by the end of the decade, it was one of the most ambitious and comprehensive plans to tackle climate change. Now the software giant’s relentless push to be the global leader in artificial intelligence is putting that goal in peril. Five years after Amazon.com Inc. raised wages to $15 an hour, half of warehouse workers surveyed by researchers say they struggle to afford enough food or a place to live. Baidu Inc.’s revenue grew at the slowest pace in more than a year, as China’s flagging economy put pressure on its core advertising business. ServiceNow Inc. has increased its workforce and expanded in enterprise software using a simple strategy: hire from its larger competitor, Salesforce Inc.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nLightspeed Commerce Inc Postmarket\n\nApplied Materials Globant DXC Technology\n\n--With assistance from Sarah Zheng and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives The DNA Test Delusion Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Europe’s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do Neuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Alphabet (GOOGL): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 79.6% and 6.8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOGL Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOGL\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs GOOGL Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 11.7% over the past month to $7.57.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alphabet may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG).\n\nAlphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 79.6% and 6.8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOG Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOG\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Alphabet, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in GOOG?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 13% over the past month to $7.66.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alphabet may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meet the Only 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Over the Last 3 Months",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" companies caught the market by storm in 2023 for their market-crushing gains. But the group has showed signs of cooling off.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that are outperforming the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) over the last three months.\n\nHere's why each of the three is doing well, whether these stocks are buys, and how to approach investing in the Magnificent Seven right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nLike any stock that has run up fast, Nvidia is one that investors have mixed feelings about. Some might think it is a bubble waiting to pop, while others believe it is on the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence (AI). But so far, the story has been led by fundamentals, which suggests that Nvidia could keep running higher.\n\nSustained rapid growth can justify even the most sky-high valuations. Especially if a company can double earnings in a single year. That's exactly what analysts are expecting from Nvidia, with consensus estimates on 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $24.87, and $31.54 for 2026.\n\nFor context, the company made $11.93 in fiscal 2024 EPS and reported its full-year fiscal 2024 earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nThe jump from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 looks promising, but there is concern that growth could cool in fiscal 2026. Still, if Nvidia notches $31.30 in fiscal 2026 EPS, that would give the stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 29 based on the current price.\n\nThat's a compelling valuation for a high-growth market leader in the early innings of the AI evolution. But it's also based on figures we won't see for nearly two years.\n\nWe'll get a better idea of how Nvidia is progressing toward these targets when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on May 22. As long as the growth is there, the stock could continue being a market winner. But if the narrative changes, even due to temporary factors, the stock could take a major hit.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nIn late February, Alphabet was the only Magnificent Seven stock with a cheaper valuation than the S&P 500. But that didn't last long.\n\nIt has been one of the hottest tech stocks as of late and went from out of favor to making a new all-time high. NVDA Chart\n\nAlphabet achieved phenomenal results in its recent quarter and announced its first dividend in company history. But it's not like the results were relatively better than peers like Meta Platforms.\n\nRather, the stock was being held back due to AI-related blunders and a view that it didn't have the innovation of a peer like Meta Platforms that has done a masterful job of monetizing AI to improve product performance and its bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is still looking to bring something new to the AI table. The recent run-up has more to do with strength from its legacy businesses like Google Search, Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android and a reminder that Alphabet is a cash cow with a ton of dry powder to reinvest in the business, make acquisitions, buy back stock -- and now, pay a dividend.\n\nAlphabet had some catching up to do, and it looks to be fairly priced now. For the next leg higher, I think the company has to show more innovation, but there are some levers it can pull in the meantime to provide value to shareholders.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon was one of the hardest-hit stocks in 2022, sinking to multiyear lows. Shares were so cheap that there were arguments that Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone was worth at least as much as the whole market cap of the company, which fell below $1 trillion in 2022 and is hovering around $2 trillion today.\n\nBeing way oversold helped propel a monster comeback in 2023. But AWS didn't even have a good year in 2023. Now, AWS has turned around, and the rest of the business is doing well, too. Just about everything is going right at Amazon, including cloud computing and domestic and international e-commerce.\n\nThe issue is that the stock still isn't cheap, and probably won't be anytime soon. Consensus analyst estimates call for 2024 EPS of $4.54, and $5.76 for 2025 -- giving Amazon a huge 32.5 P/E ratio based on 2025 earnings.\n\nSome investors might prefer to value the company based on price-to-sales (P/S) instead of P/E since it spends so much money reinvesting in the business and books far lower earnings than it could if it were more conservative. For 2024, analyst consensus sales estimates are $638.2 billion, and $708.7 billion for 2025, which would give Amazon a P/S ratio of 2.75 based on 2025 figures. From that perspective, Amazon is more reasonably priced. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe glass-half-full outlook would say that it deserves a higher P/S today than in the past because each dollar of sales is of higher quality. To an extent, that's true because AWS is making up a larger share of the company's revenue, and AWS is a high-margin cash cow that drives the profitability of the broader business.\n\nFor context, AWS generated $9.4 billion in operating income in the first quarter of 2024 on $25 billion in sales, compared to $5.1 billion from $21.4 billion in sales a year earlier. AWS still only made up about 17.5% of total Amazon sales in the recent quarter. But it was a much smaller share of the business just five years ago, whereas today, it can help move the top line and dominate the bottom line.\n\nThere's certainly a buy case to be made for Amazon, even after its recent run-up. But it doesn't have Nvidia's growth, and yet it is still an expensive stock, even based on estimates over a year into the future.\n\nBuying a top stock for the right reasons\n\nIt's important to understand that sentiment and context can have just as much impact on a stock's short-term performance -- if not more -- than the fundamentals.\n\nAs a long-term investor, it can be helpful to know what is driving a stock's price to determine if it is a good value or if a lot of the expected growth is already priced in.\n\nThe story is out on Nvidia. The projections are so lofty that the company has to put up unbelievable results just to look like a good value. But so far, it has lived up to the hype.\n\nAlphabet is an excellent example of a company that made no significant changes but saw its stock price shoot up once investors were reminded that the strength of its core business outshines any AI snags.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon had sold off far too much for such a high-quality business. The growth is excellent, but the valuation is a lot higher today.\n\nThere's a variety of reasons the other four Magnificent Seven are underperforming over the last three months. But as a generalization, I'd say that Microsoft and Meta Platforms have raised the bar so high (and both stocks have crushed the Nasdaq Composite over the last year and a half) that it's hard to blow expectations out of the water.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple and Tesla are facing slowing growth, a bad look relative to their better-performing megacap peers.\n\nExpectations are everything to investors. If Apple and Tesla return to growth, it would be easier for those stocks to impress. But the degree of uncertainty with that prospect is why both stocks are out of favor.\n\nBy comparison, Nvidia is a darling that is already expected to keep growing. And as we saw with Microsoft and Meta in their recent earnings, a company can keep growing at an impressive clip, but it still might not be enough to move the needle.\n\nThe simplest way to approach the Magnificent Seven is to go with the company or companies you think have the best chance of growing or blending growth and value over at least the next three to five years rather than jumping in and out of whatever is working in a matter of months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "In a single night, self-driving startup Cruise went from sizzling startup to cautionary tale. Here’s what really happened—and how GM is scrambling to save its $10B bet",
        "content": "October 2 was a quiet night on the streets of San Francisco. It was moderately cloudy, and Fleet Week activities had just begun at Sunset Library. But in the Tenderloin neighborhood, at 9:29pm, a pedestrian stepped out into the street, crossing 5th and Market, and was struck by a green Nissan Sentra sedan. What happened next would ripple all the way through one of the largest corporations on earth—GM.\n\nBecause after the woman was struck the first time, “Panini”—one of the self-driving robo-taxis in Cruise’s fleet that had been out on the streets for about a year and a half—ran over her, stopped, then dragged the woman for 20 feet as it tried to pull over.\n\nWithin seconds of the initial impact, Cruise’s control room in Scottsdale, Az.—where hourly agents monitored Cruise’s fleet 24 hours a day in cubicles fitted with three computer screens—was looped in. By the time a live three-second video of the incident transmitted onto the computer screens in front of Cruise’s remote assistance agents, the car had already incorrectly labeled the incident as a side collision and begun to pull over, unaware it was dragging a human body beneath its wheels.\n\nAn exhaustive internal investigation reconstructed nearly every detail of the accident, but it couldn’t clear up exactly what Cruise’s remote assistance team saw that evening. One thing is certain: The incident was the most serious in Cruise’s history, and it immediately thrust the robo-taxi company and its 80% owner, General Motors, into a spiral of federal scrutiny and investigations as well as public outrage and condemnation.\n\nBefore the end of October 2023, regulators were alleging that Cruise had withheld important details of the incident from them. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles had rescinded Cruise’s operational permit, leading Cruise to voluntarily pull its vehicles off the streets across the U.S. GM—which had largely let the company run independently, despite its close communication with senior leadership and operations—swept in to replace nearly all of Cruise’s management, shuffle up its board, and lay off nearly a quarter of its almost 4,000 employees in a bid to salvage Cruise’s reputation and preserve the more than $10 billion that GM has plowed into the company over the last eight years.\n\nCruise—once a crown jewel within General Motors CEO and Cruise Chair Mary Barra’s broader strategy to rival electric competitor Tesla—suddenly had become an outsized liability, just as General Motors was simultaneously trying to manage the six-week union strike by workers of the Big Three U.S. automakers that was threatening its business. Those labor strikes were unprecedented, but the revelations around Cruise’s back-and-forth with regulators were also unnerving GM shareholders. As a financial analyst put it during GM’s first earnings call that mentioned Cruise’s permit being revoked, the company's handling of the whole debacle was very “un-GM like.” “I agree with you,” Barra responded. “It was uncharacteristic, and it definitely is something that we're working to manage well,” she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut unlike a startup that implodes then closes its doors, GM is unfurling the full force of a Fortune 500 giant to resuscitate the project. Whereas GM had previously taken more of a backseat approach with Cruise, it is now intimately hands-on in its subsidiary’s day-to-day—and in the sensitive task of rolling Cruise robo-taxis back onto the streets. To report this story, Fortune spoke with eleven former Cruise employees or contract workers, in addition to Cruise investors, analysts, and San Francisco politicians. Fortune also interviewed Cruise’s newly-appointed Chief Safety Officer, Steve Kenner. What is clear? The moves GM and Cruise’s new leadership team make next will be a roadmap of how a giant corporation can rescue an innovative startup—or be driven off course trying to save it.\n\n‘I can't stop smiling’\n\nTwo years ago, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, sporting a black leather jacket, peered into the window of white and orange Chevvy Bolt that was pulling up to the curb to pick her up—no driver in sight.\n\n“Oh my gosh. This is incredible,” Barra said after sliding into the back seat of the Cruise robo-taxi, known by Cruise staffers as “Tostada.” Barra was sitting next to Kyle Vogt, cofounder of Cruise and its then-president and Chief Technology Officer. “It’s too bad that we have to wear masks though, because I can’t stop smiling,” Barra said.\n\nThe video, which Barra posted on her LinkedIn two years ago, showed her taking her first Cruise ride, though she had already been talking up its technology for years—ever since General Motors had scooped up a majority of the startup’s shares in March 2016, and two years later when she became Chair of its board. The acquisition, which was for a combination of cash and GM equity, put the fledgling company at $1 billion when it was still just three years old and cemented Vogt as a two-time billion-dollar exit founder—and made him and Cruise cofounder Dan Kan the youngest-ever senior directors at General Motors.\n\nVogt, who had built his first self-driving car prototype at the age of 13, had a small team of just 40 engineers when GM pulled it into the fold, but it quickly became an outsized piece of GM’s strategy as it experimented with rideshare and autonomy. GM had already made a strategic investment in Lyft, and in early 2016, it had launched its own car sharing program called Maven, though it would shut that down during the pandemic.\n\nImportantly, Cruise would become an integral piece of GM’s broader big-vision strategy to go 100% electric by 2035. Elon Musk’s Tesla had left legacy carmakers like General Motors in the dust. While General Motors had been working on manufacturing EVs since the 90s, GM had struggled to manufacture electric vehicles en masse, and in 2022, had to recall many of its Chevy Bolt EVs over fire risks. Even if President Biden was publicly trying to give General Motors most of the credit for the EV revolution, it was Tesla that was successfully putting millions of cars on the streets—and it was being rewarded by investors accordingly.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nCruise’s promise of self-driving vehicles was the kind of shiny new technology that could give General Motors an edge and differentiate it in the market—and maybe even make the legacy automaker “cool.” GM plowed $592 million into the company in 2017, doubling its staff within the first year of GM’s acquisition. Within eight years, Cruise had scaled to nearly 4,000 employees (plus a host of contract workers) across San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Austin, Dubai, and in Japan. In 2022, Cruise beat Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo to commercial operation, becoming the first company to launch a fared robo-taxi service in San Francisco that February. Cruise welcomed strategic investors like Honda and Microsoft. It was building out a driverless last-mile delivery service with Walmart in Phoenix and had 70 of its robo-taxis on the road in San Francisco by the end of 2022.\n\n“We are the first company that has actually deployed an autonomous rideshare company service in San Francisco,” Barra told Fortune of Cruise in an interview in Aug. 2022. “We're actually charging for rides and there is no driver… So I'm very excited about where our technology is. So that's huge.”\n\nAbout a year before Barra took that first ride, there was an executive shuffle within Cruise. GM veteran Dan Ammann, who had once rivaled Barra for the top seat at GM and had been chief executive at Cruise since 2019, was replaced by Vogt, and he left the company at the end of 2021. Ammann and Barra had sparred over when Cruise should go public, which was first reported by Bloomberg and independently confirmed by Fortune. (Ammann didn't respond to Fortune's request for comment.)\n\nWithin two months after Ammann had left the company, Cruise was rolling its cars onto the road in San Francisco, leading to internal clashes among some of its own employees, who debated whether the technology was accurate enough to roll out en masse. These clashes would only heighten in 2023 when the company started scaling at a rapid clip.\n\n“These vehicles were not ready. And we would say as much,” one of the former employees says, noting that they believed that the number of “unwanted public interactions”—or UPIs—on the company’s internal database called “RINO,” were too high. The former employee described instances of vehicles freezing in the middle of a four-way stop or stopping when an emergency vehicle would go past it, and said that the robo taxis couldn’t see objects that were too close to the ground—recalling staffers joking about how a Cruise might run over Mayor London Breed’s cat, because the robo taxi wouldn’t be able to detect it.  “I believe that we were getting close—I just think that we tried it a little bit too early when there were things that were unsafe,” a separate former employee says, noting how isolated vehicle responses, such as a Cruise not stopping quickly enough at a stop sign, was akin to “if a computer had a learner's permit.” In 2022, Cruise beat Tesla and Google’s Waymo to operation, becoming the first company to launch a commercial robo taxi service in San Francisco that February.\n\nThere was a notable shift at Cruise particularly in 2023, when Vogt became laser-focused on scale, according to people who worked there at the time. One person says that the company set an internal goal to reach $150 million in annual revenue by the end of the year. “Deployment decisions were basically being made on-the-fly at night by [Kyle Vogt],” that person asserts. (Vogt declined to comment for this story)\n\nBut the subject of readiness was contested internally—particularly when Cruise was first launching service, and only had a few vehicles on the road. A former employee said the vehicles were “thoroughly tested” when they were first debuted for commercial service in 2022 in San Francisco. They described the lengthy process that led up to the rollout: Running billions of miles of simulations in what was called “the matrix,” testing on private road systems, and tens of thousands of miles with human drivers—all of which preceded the rollout. After the cars were rolled out in 2022, small issues would lead to a reduction in fleet size, or trigger a full fleet stoppage, they said.\n\nBut as more and more cars were introduced to the streets, Cruise was often at odds with the public in San Francisco, who didn’t seem quite ready for the new technology to be on the streets. People would mess with the cars—putting traffic cones on top of the vehicles so the robo taxis would pull over, or throwing rocks at the windshields. One remote assistance operator recalled a man pulling down his pants and sitting his naked bottom on the hood of the robo-taxi while she was trying to move the vehicle. “A lot of people didn't want Cruise to exist and would make a joke out of it,” a former employee says. Another former employee recalled people slashing Cruise tires and a man who repeatedly chased the cars with a hatchet, sometimes when passengers were inside.\n\nAnd Cruise’s relationship with regulators was at times contentious. The city and county of San Francisco was repeatedly laying out complaints of driverless Cruise cars sitting disabled and blocking traffic, signaling in one direction yet moving in another, or blocking transit vehicles. In summer 2023, head of the SFMTA Jeff Tumlin went on a podcast, berating companies like Cruise and Waymo and making statements about the data they shared with regulators that were inaccurate (The podcast ultimately issue a factual correction around some of Tumlin’s statements of how AV companies were engaging with his agency).\n\nThere was an “us versus them” mentality that ran through the fabric of the organization, according to the internal investigation after the October incident, which was made public earlier this year, and accounts from former employees. Two former employees said senior leadership was resistant to working with San Francisco law enforcement and regulators.\n\nThat attitude extended to the media. Employees expressed frustration at the frequent negative media coverage or political jabs lodged at Cruise, and said some staffers took it personally.\n\n“Kyle was very passionate about what we do here at Cruise,” one of the former employees says. “He would talk all the time, at length, of drunk driving accidents and the amount of people who are killed every single year. He mentioned almost every single company stand-up meeting that we had—just to try and drive the point home that we can make a safer world by what we do here.”\n\n‘It was hard to watch’\n\nFor San Franciscans trying out the new, Cruise robo-taxi service for the first time, the whole process could feel futuristic. A user pulls up the app, orders a Cruise car with a clever name—like “Poppy”—and it pulls up to the curb. After getting in, a tablet in the back instructs you to shut the doors, then Poppy takes you on your way.\n\nPowering all of it was a lot of hidden manpower to make sure the vehicles stayed out of trouble. That’s where the staff in Scottsdale came in. When the fleet was operational, that office housed Cruise’s operations center, with a customer service team, an incident and crisis management team, and roadside dispatch.\n\nOne of the rooms is a 24/7 control room, where remote assistance workers worked 10 hours a day, four days a week, monitoring both the autonomous fleet—suggesting routes for the taxis when they got stuck or didn’t know how to proceed—but also monitoring the vehicles that were being operated with drivers. If a driver took their hands off the steering wheel, or started blinking too slowly (indicating tiredness), the remote assistance workers would alert their supervisors.\n\nThe mood in the control room was generally light-hearted, two former agents say. In true Silicon Valley startup fashion, Cruise’s office offered free meals to its employees—with chips, energy drinks, oatmeal, and candy for them to snack on from two kitchens during their shifts. Managers would crack jokes. “I thought it was fun,” one of them says. “Everybody was nice. Everyone was wanting to help you.”\n\nBut the evening of Oct. 2, after the pedestrian had been struck by a Cruise vehicle, the aura in the control room shifted markedly. No formal announcement about the crash was made within the control room, according to the agent present, though a longer, 14-second video of the accident was shared with some of the people present via Slack, or shown directly—alerting others to what had taken place, they said.\n\nOne of the agents working that evening, who spoke with Fortune on condition of anonymity, left the control room for a period after being shown the footage. “I just took a walk—just to get my mind off of it—because it was hard to watch,” they said. (Cruise says that all RA employees involved in the response “were given the opportunity to go home to cope with the experience.”)\n\nThat evening, Cruise team members jumped into crisis management mode, paging employees who needed to be looped in and creating a virtual “War Room” on Google Meet and a corresponding Slack Channel to communicate about and deal with the incident. Meanwhile, employees went back-and-forth with the NHTSA, the San Francisco MTA, San Francisco Police Department, and San Francisco Fire Department about the incident and set up meetings for the following day. Cruise was fielding inquiries from the press and was solely focused on trying to correct the record to reflect that the pedestrian had initially been struck by a separate vehicle in a hit-and-run—not by Panini.\n\nEmployees didn’t know the extent of the robo taxi’s responsibility in the accident—that the vehicle had subsequently dragged the pedestrian 20 feet after she was struck by the other vehicle—until early the morning of Oct. 3, when the complete footage from the car had been uploaded to Cruise servers and reviewed. At that point, employees realized the incident was much more serious than they realized, and some 200 people at the company were pulled into the virtual “War Room.”\n\nBut Vogt and Cruise’s vice president of communications, Aaron McLear, decided not to alter Cruise’s press statement to include that Panini had dragged the pedestrian, nor share the full footage with reporters. “[W]e did share all the info with all of our regulators and the investigators. We have no obligation to share anything with the press,” McLear wrote in a Slack message, according to Cruise’s subsequent third-party investigation of the incident which GM made public earlier this year. (McLear declined to comment)\n\nIn meetings with regulators on Oct. 3 however, Cruise employees didn’t proactively discuss how its robo-taxi had dragged the pedestrian—instead relying on playing a full video of the incident, which showed the dragging, to speak for itself. And there were internet issues in all but one of the meetings with regulators—limiting what exactly officials saw and creating a disconnect in what regulators took away from the meetings, the investigation showed.\n\nAdding to what had already been such a difficult week for the company and many of its employees, one of Cruise’s incident analysts had suddenly passed away a few days before the pedestrian accident, leading Cruise to bring in counselors and offer time off to the employees who were close to him. Around that same time, one of Cruise’s contract drivers, who was manually driving a robo-taxi in one of the new cities, was t-boned by a speeding driver and hospitalized with significant injuries. “That was a crazy week at Cruise–I’m not going to lie,” says someone who worked in the Scottsdale operations center.\n\nMeanwhile, Vogt was pressing for things to return to normal, according to the investigation that followed the incident. When members of the safety and engineering teams asked whether the fleet should be grounded, Vogt and Cruise COO Gil West said the data didn't justify a shutdown, the report says. And, to the concern of several Cruise staffers, Vogt and West determined to end the “War Room” by 6:05p.m, the day after the incident. Employees \"expressed concern that there were no further scheduled [crisis management team] meetings for the biggest accident Cruise had faced in its history,\" the report says. People were “livid,” an employee says.\n\n\"It was uncharacteristic, and it definitely is something that we're working to manage well,\"\n\nMary Barra, CEO of General Motors and Chair of Cruise's Board of Directors\n\nOn Oct. 6, an article ran in Forbes in which San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin accused Cruise of “telling a half truth,” and not disclosing that the robo-taxi had dragged the pedestrian 20 feet. Four days later, the DMV asked for a complete video of the accident, and a couple days after, the NHTSA told Cruise it intended to open a “preliminary evaluation” into the accident as well as three other incidents involving pedestrians in San Francisco.\n\nOn Oct. 24, the DMV suspended Cruise’s driverless permit, noting in a release that the Department believed Cruise vehicles were “not safe for the public’s operation” and that the company had “misrepresented any information related to safety of the autonomous technology of its vehicles.” The DMV rescinded Cruise’s permit the very same day that Barra had earlier underscored Cruise’s expansion plans on an earnings call with analysts. Shortly after, Cruise voluntarily pulled its entire fleet off the streets across the U.S., including its human-driven cars. Vogt resigned, and cofounder Dan Kan, the Chief Product Officer, resigned a day later.\n\nThe company brought in Quinn Emanuel, a legal firm to investigate the incident, which determined that Cruise had suffered from “poor leadership, mistakes in judgment, lack of coordination, an ‘us versus them’ mentality with regulators, and a fundamental misapprehension of Cruise’s obligations of accountability and transparency to the government and the public.” After the findings, Cruise parted ways with nine employees and senior leaders, and completely cleaned house, bringing on a slew of new executives.\n\nBut even after Quinn Emanuel’s 105-page report, questions remain about what exactly happened that night. Two operators were interviewed about a week after the incident and asked to share their recollection of events, according to Cruise’s subsequent investigation.  But they had been laid off by the time Quinn Emanuel sought to interview them and the investigators had to rely on a Cruise staffer’s “contemporaneous notes.” Another two interviewees provided information the law firm couldn’t verify that “appears contrary to the weight of the evidence,” the report said.  The agent working that evening who spoke to Fortune, who was laid off in November, said no one at Cruise had ever reached out to them about the incident. \"There's a lot of stuff lost now that people will never know,\" another former employee says.\n\nA representative from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, where the pedestrian was taken in critical condition, said that the pedestrian had been discharged, but declined to share any further information. The San Francisco Police Department said its investigation into the incident is still ongoing.\n\nCruise settled with the woman who was dragged at a figure between $8 million to $12 million, Fortune reported earlier this week. The company has also proposed a fine of $112,500 as part of a settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which had accused the company of omitting material facts to the regulator. The Cruise \"Origin\" vehicles, spacious van-like vehicles built by GM for Cruise, were being tested in Austin before Cruise pulled its vehicles off the streets last fall. Cruise is keeping them off the streets for now.\n\nAfter October 2nd\n\nGM has always been close to Cruise’s operations. GM controls the Cruise board (Of its seven seats, four are GM executives and three also sit on GM’s board.) And particularly after Ammann’s departure, GM’s relationship with Cruise’s senior leadership became more closely intertwined, according two people familiar with the matter. GM executives Regina Carto, who leads global product safety, and Frank Gorman, GM’s assistant general counsel, had regularly-scheduled meetings with several of Cruise’s senior leaders, one person with knowledge of the matters says. Meanwhile, Cruise’s AV technicians were regularly in touch with GM engineers to handle issues or updates with the Chevy Bolt. Cruise Origins, the spacious, van-like vehicles without driver’s seats, steering wheels, or pedals, would be tested at GM’s headquarters in Detroit, as well as one of their test tracks outside of San Francisco. Cruise frequently provided mileage reports to the board and other senior managers within GM, and it would report all major incidents, including how they were handled and how Cruise planned to improve its response moving forward. “Someone had some form of daily contact [with GM] on some level,” one former employee says.\n\nTwo people specifically described an \"undertone\" within the company that GM was monitoring them. \"There was a constant undertone that GM was watching. GM expects us to produce. We have to get on the road. Waymo is better than us,” one of them says, referring to Alphabet's rival self-driving cars.\n\nStill, Cruise had other investors, and GM had left it to operate independently, trusting its senior executive team to handle day-to-day operations, including its interactions with regulatory agencies, legal affairs, and communications.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nAfter the incident, when GM shares dipped below $30 per share for the first time in three years, all of that would change. While Cruise EVP Mo Elshenawy was promoted to be the company’s co-president and CTO, board member Glidden stepped in as co-president and Chief Administrative Officer, and GM became acutely involved in investigating the October incident, restructuring the company and who was running it, and overseeing its interactions with the media. For example, GM’s Chief Communication Officer and other senior GM leaders started to sometimes sit in on Cruise board meetings, according to someone familiar with the matter. GM board member Jon McNeill, who was Lyft’s former COO, stepped onto Cruise's board, and Mike Abbott, GM’s executive vice president of software and services, took an observer seat. GM’s president, Mark Reuss, personally interviewed Steve Kenner, previously the global director of automotive safety at Ford who was hired as Cruise’s Chief Safety Officer earlier this year. Glidden, who is GM's executive vice president of legal, has been representing the company in its ongoing regulatory inquiries (His base salary rose to $1.1 million, up from $850,000 as a result, SEC filings show).\n\nIn the weeks after the DMV’s suspension, Cruise employees were anxious—particularly after Vogt resigned. “[We] started to see the writing on the wall,” one of the employees says, referring to discussions of potential layoffs. “A lot of people just were really nervous.”\n\nWith cars pulled from the roads in all markets, some staffers who worked directly with the fleet had little to do. Testing was moved into garages and test tracks. In the control room, remote assistance workers didn’t have cars to monitor, so were asked to review and label thousands of video clips during their shifts.\n\nRight up to the DMV’s suspension of Cruise’s permit, Cruise had been on a fast track to scale. The robo-taxi company had publicly announced plans to get to $1 billion in revenue by 2025. It was already providing limited service in Phoenix, Austin, Houston, Dallas, and Miami—and it was working on building out operations in Nashville, as well as overseas in Japan and in Dubai. Out in Phoenix, Cruise had been expanding its range of self-driving shopping delivery that it was doing with Walmart.\n\nA handful of Cruise Origins had been transported to Cruise’s R&D facility and track in Phoenix, where employees had been training with them. “We were just starting to get acquainted and integrated with the Origins,” says a former Cruise employee who was working with the vehicles.\n\nImmediately, all of those plans were put on hold. With autonomous vehicles off the roads, Walmart deliveries in Phoenix reverted to human drivers, then eventually stopped altogether. During a layoff in 2023, General Motors ultimately let go of 24% of Cruise’s employees—or around 900 people—and later parted ways with many of its contractors.\n\n\"The leaders involved exercised very poor judgment in how they conducted themselves and interacted with the regulators,\"\n\nSteve Kenner, Chief Safety Officer of Cruise\n\nApproximately seven months since the incident, General Motors is just starting to lay the groundwork to relaunch. Cruise said earlier this week that it will start testing its self-driving vehicles in Phoenix—operating autonomously, but with human drivers inside the vehicles to take over, if needed. At the beginning of last month, Cruise submitted responses to the California DMV to reinstate its permit, though the DMV told Fortune those are still under review. As it relaunches service, Cruise plans to re-map each city where it will operate, slowly release commercial rides with human supervision, then eventually move to autonomous rides, according to Chief Safety Officer Kenner.\n\nKenner is unsparing about Cruise’s previous management. “The leaders involved exercised very poor judgment in how they conducted themselves and interacted with the regulators,” he tells Fortune. Since Kenner’s arrival, Cruise has restructured its operations around its safety team, so that Kenner has veto power before Cruise makes any kind of incremental rollout—even if it’s putting manually-driven cars on the street. He’s also told regulators that GM and Cruise will work together with them on safety issues. That’s already playing out in many of the meetings: All of Kenner’s meetings thus far with the NHTSA, which still has two investigations open into Cruise, have included GM’s head of product safety, Regina Carto, too. “She and I have been talking a lot—almost on a daily basis, including just finishing up [a call] about a half hour ago,” Kenner said in the interview.\n\nKenner has been traveling between Phoenix, Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., meeting with regulators and transportation officials and trying to rebuild the company’s relationships. “I know trust is earned, and we're going to be judged by our actions going forward,” Kenner said. “It's going to take some time.\n\nBut even as Cruise robo-taxis start driving the roads again, it will be a different company than before. For one, employees are no longer awarded restricted stock units, just cash—making Cruise’s compensation plan more akin to that of a corporation than a Silicon Valley startup. (GM offered to buy shares at around $11-$12 per share earlier this year, according to a former employee, down from around $25 per share at the end of last year. Reuters reported similar details in February)\n\nGM has also slashed Cruise’s annual budget by $1 billion and has made it clear that it will pull back the pace. As of now, Cruise is keeping its Origin vehicles off the streets.\n\nCruise’s new, slower pace will make it more akin to Waymo, which had driven its vehicles 20 million miles with drivers before it started putting its cars onto the roads fully autonomously. That’s something former Cruise employees who were concerned the company was moving too fast think is a good thing. “They're trying to implement some new safety initiatives which is great. It’s very good to see,” one of them says.\n\nCruise employees are quick to point to the data we have so far on self-driving vehicles, which both Waymo and Cruise have published, and which has been closely analyzed. The initial figures suggest that self-driving cars are much safer than their human counterparts. But new technology, it seems, is always going to be held to a much higher standard when it comes to safety.\n\n“We all see the potential benefits and value of autonomous vehicles, including safety, but we need to make sure these powerful new technologies are ready for prime time,” says San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, who through a lawsuit in December has sought to restrict the number of robo-taxis operating in San Francisco. Chiu describes himself as a supporter of self-driving cars—so long as they are safe. “Unfortunately the many events over the past year have suggested otherwise, so this is why we have been pushing for accountability, transparency, and guardrails.”\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\n‘In the wilds of San Francisco’\n\nPart of Cruise’s original allure, executives repeatedly told shareholders, was that Cruise could recruit different talent than GM, and had an ideal lab on the streets of San Francisco. “What really attracted us to Cruise was not only the capability that they had already developed, but the fact they were doing it, I call it, in the wilds of San Francisco, right? Literally on the downtown streets of San Francisco, the most—or one of the most complex environments to try to build and deploy new technology,” Pamela Fletcher, GM’s former vice president of electric vehicles, said at the Citigroup Global Technology Conference in late 2016.\n\nBillions of dollars later, Cruise has lost much of what gave it that edge. It can no longer operate in the “wilds of San Francisco”—at least for now. And it’s no longer very independent from GM either. Moreover, Cruise’s first-mover advantage has been erased. “When you're standing still, and Waymo’s moving forward—it's a big difference,” says David Whiston, an automotive analyst at Morningstar.\n\nWhen GE placed its bet on Cruise, it was hoping for all the glory that comes with getting in early on a lightning hot startup that’s unconstrained by bureaucracy and tradition. But it’s easy to forget the second part of the old startup mantra: “move fast and break things.” And in this case, a single misstep onto a dark San Francisco street didn’t just put Cruise’s reputation on the line, it imperiled GM’s, too. Now the 100-year-old company is in a position it never wanted to be in: It has to move fast—and fix things.\n\n—With additional reporting from Christiaan Hetzner\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 16, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA and Arista Networks ANET.\n\nNext AI Bull Run Starts: 3 Top-Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend\n\nYes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology.\n\nJust this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet.\n\nAdditionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally.\n\nNew AI Product Releases\n\nOpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework.\n\nThe GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online.\n\nThen, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT.\n\nIn one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant.\n\nThe presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow.\n\nAgain, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos.\n\nStock Picks\n\nFor this next bull run in AI stocks, my favorite player is Alphabet. Many analysts and commentators have been very loud about how Google is playing catch up in AI, or that GPTs are going to disrupt Google's search engine.\n\nThey have forgotten just how deeply entrenched Alphabet’s products are in daily life. Alphabet has nine products with more than 1 billion users along with the epic amounts of data and engineers to implement the new technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet enjoys both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, and a compelling technical trading setup.\n\nGOOGL stock just broke out from a bull flag and looks ready to make new YTD highs.\n\nAlphabet also has a very reasonable valuation, trading at 22.5x forward earnings, which is in line with the market average and below its 10-year median of 26.2x.\n\nMy next AI stock recommendation is not very original. Nvidia, has been and is the name to own for the trend in AI. The company is simply years ahead of other semiconductor producers, and its data center chips remain the key piece of infrastructure for technology being built with generative AI.\n\nNvidia also jumped back onto the Zacks Rank this morning with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates, with FY25 increasing by 7% in the last two months.\n\nAnd even with all the talk of Nvidia being wildly overpriced, the stock remains reasonably valued thanks to the massive growth of sales and earnings. Today, Nvidia is trading at 40x forward earnings, just below the industry average and its 10-year median.\n\nEPS are also forecast to grow at an incredible 30% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nNVDA stock, like GOOGL, also just broke out from a clean bull flag. As the leading name in AI, I would expect Nvidia to run to new highs in no time.\n\nMy final AI stock pick for the next leg higher is Arista Networks. Lesser known than the other two tech giants shared, Arista Networks is a leading provider of cloud networking solutions for large data centers. The company specializes in designing and delivering high-performance network switches and software-defined networking (SDN) solutions that offer scalability, reliability, and programmability.\n\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in providing the networking infrastructure necessary to support AI workloads and applications. As AI models become increasingly complex and data-intensive, they require robust and high-speed network connections to transfer data between servers, storage systems, and other components of the AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence boom has been and will continue to be a major boon to Arista’s core business.\n\nLike the others, ANET also has a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflected by strongly upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nArista Networks stock has actually shown relative strength during the recent selloff, and over the last two and a half months it has gained more than both Nvidia and Alphabet. Because I am a fan of momentum, I consider this relative strength to be very bullish, especially in this AI context.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDon’t sleep on the AI boom, because we are still early days. Keen investors will continue to be given opportunities to profit from this new technology, so keep your ears to the ground, focus on stocks with top Zacks Ranks, and be a prudent risk manager.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "2 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation",
        "content": "While there are no guarantees in the stock market, sticking with growing companies that are leaders in their markets is one of the safest ways to choose stocks for the long term.\n\nServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) and Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are two leading tech companies producing stellar financial results that are sending their share prices to new highs. Here's why these stocks are smart buys for 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. ServiceNow\n\nCompanies are always looking for ways to improve employee productivity, and they are increasingly looking at generative artificial intelligence (AI) as the answer in 2024. This is a big opportunity for the leading digital workflow platform ServiceNow.\n\nThe stock has delivered a cumulative return of 1,400% over the last 10 years, which was driven by average annual revenue growth of 35%. The good news for new investors is the company is still growing revenue at impressive rates. In the most recent quarter, subscription revenue grew 24% year over year, with generative AI solutions playing a key role in securing top deals with other companies.\n\nA great advantage for ServiceNow is its partnership with Microsoft to integrate Now Assist AI with Microsoft Copilot. It shows why ServiceNow is the gold standard in the digital workflow market. Most of ServiceNow's biggest deals in the quarter were for generative AI products.\n\nImportantly, subscription-based businesses make for solid long-term investments because of their recurring revenue streams and high margins. This explains why analysts expect the company's earnings per share to grow faster than revenue at an annualized rate of 29% in the coming years. That is enough growth to potentially double your investment in five years or so, even if investors are paying a lower price-to-earnings multiple for the stock down the road, which is currently steep at 77 times trailing earnings.\n\n2. Alphabet (Google)\n\nAI will have a lasting impact on the economy, and nowhere will that be more evident than how people shop and find information online. This is why investors are increasingly looking at Alphabet as a major beneficiary of this revolutionary technology. Google has been investing in AI for many years, and it's starting to pay off.\n\nRevenue and earnings grew 15% and 61% year over year in the first quarter. The company is delivering these impressive results while investing in its Gemini AI model to bring smarter search results and other features to billions of users that rely on Google products.\n\nIt's also seeing strong demand for AI services from enterprise customers in Google Cloud, which is turning into a profitable revenue source for Alphabet. Google Cloud hauled in $900 million of operating profit last quarter. That is up from just $191 million in the year-ago quarter. The company says its new AI models and algorithms are more than 100 times more efficient than they were just 18 months ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has soared to new highs this year, but still trades at a reasonable valuation. Analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings at an annualized rate of about 19% over the next several years. At a forward P/E of 22, investors can expect the stock to deliver returns consistent with its future earnings growth. That could mean a double in the next five years, if not more, depending on how well Google monetizes AI features across Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ServiceNow right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ServiceNow, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ServiceNow wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.",
        "content": "The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech.\n\nNo longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley.\n\nInstead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG,GOOGL).\n\n\"They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,\" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. \"And they're doing it for a reason.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference on March 21, as he announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The case was filed in New Jersey. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers.\n\nProsecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals.\n\nThe government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division.\n\nIt’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country.\n\n\"I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,\" Arteaga said.\n\nRoss is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.\n\nOutside of D.C. and a few other popular antitrust districts, Ross said, \"antitrust is like a hen's tooth — there are very few cases, and most average federal district judges have heard zero antitrust cases.\"\n\nD.C.'s dominance\n\nD.C. has long been the chosen spot for many of the most prominent antitrust cases in US history, including landmark cases against AT&T (T) and Microsoft in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nIts dominance extends back even further in time.\n\nSince 1899, the earliest year records are available, the DOJ filed 391 antitrust cases in the district.\n\nThat is nearly double the next closest counts of 222 filings in the Northern District of California and 220 in the Southern District of New York.\n\nStory continues Then-Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates at a June 2000 press conference in Redmond, Wash., to discuss the Justice Department's antitrust case against his company. (DAN LEVINE/AFP via Getty Images) (DAN LEVINE via Getty Images)\n\nIt held its dominance for most of the last decade as well. D.C. was home to the most new cases or tied for that title from 2015 through 2022.\n\nThat changed last year. In 2023, the government filed more antitrust cases in several places outside D.C., including states like Michigan and Oklahoma.\n\nWhen factoring in private antitrust suits, the district with the most combined competition suits last year — totaling 42 — was the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Federal district courts in New Jersey, Illinois, and New York followed.\n\nThe government's shift away from D.C. is happening at a time when there are rising concerns within the legal community about judge shopping in hopes of sympathetic rulings and state and federal governments intervening in private antitrust litigation.\n\nBills to disrupt judicial power in single-judge districts have been introduced in the Senate, and the Judicial Conference recommended changes to the case assignment process in March.\n\nChanging course\n\nThe Biden White House started its campaign against Big Tech close to home, in the D.C. District Court. That's where the FTC, under its Biden-nominated Chair Lina Khan, refiled an action against Facebook in 2021.\n\nThat case, first brought during former President Trump’s administration, alleged that the social media giant illegally blocked competition through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nIt also took over another case filed in D.C. by the prior administration, against Google, challenging the company’s online search dominance. A ruling from the judge in that case is expected soon.\n\nThen prosecutors changed course and veered away from D.C.\n\nIn December 2022, the FTC chose the US District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge Microsoft’s acquisition of video gaming giant Activision Blizzard. The effort failed, and the regulators appealed the matter to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nA month later, in January 2023, the DOJ, joined by eight state attorneys general, went after Google in a second antitrust case, this time in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Prosecutors alleged Google abused its monopoly in the digital advertising technology market.\n\nIn September of 2023, the FTC and 17 states sued Amazon in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The suit accused the retail giant of illegally monopolizing online marketplace services.\n\nThen this year in March, the DOJ and a group of state attorneys general sued Apple in the US District Court in New Jersey. The prosecutors claimed Apple illegally abused its dominance in the smartphone market.\n\n'Trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit'\n\nNew Jersey is a less logical place for the government to challenge Apple when compared to some of the other cases outside D.C.\n\nAmazon was targeted in the Washington district, where the company is headquartered, and Microsoft was sued in the Bay Area, where it has a significant physical footprint.\n\nBut Apple isn't domiciled in New Jersey nor does it have dominant operations there.\n\nOne factor that may help explain the government's choice is that appeals from New Jersey's federal trial courts are heard by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which in recent years has handed down decisions that could favor the government's claims against the iPhone maker.\n\n\"I think I think that the DOJ concluded that the case law was much more favorable for the Third Circuit as opposed to the Ninth Circuit,\" Arteaga said. Apple CEO Tim Cook in April. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAs for the case against Google in Virginia, the DOJ may be looking for a quick turn. The Eastern District court has earned its \"rocket docket\" nickname for the speed with which it handles litigation.\n\n\"I think there probably is an element of trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit,\" Ross said.\"Whether that's going to pay off for them or hurt them, I don't know.\"\n\nThe tactic, he said, could lead to more chaos in the law and increase the chances of getting one of the cases heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nKeith Harrison, also a partner in Crowell & Moring’s litigation practice, said bringing the cases against the country's most dominant and consumer-facing companies could prove valuable for the administration, win or lose, as it tries to communicate its agenda to a broader population.\n\n\"This [Apple] case is going to be a big case, wherever it's brought,\" Harrison said. \"But in New Jersey, it’s going to be the biggest case in that courthouse, and in local news on a regular basis.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google is reinventing itself for the AI age",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in the midst of a full-blown AI evolution. On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader.\n\n“We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.”\n\nFor years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products.\n\nAll this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year.\n\nGoogle’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai updates the world about Google's latest products during the company's I/O developer conference on Tuesday. (Christoph Dernbach/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nStealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources.\n\nIt’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations.\n\nWhile the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra.\n\nDuring a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai discusses Google's new AI push during the company's I/O developers conference on Tuesday. (Christoph Dernbach/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nUnlike digital assistants Google Assistant and Apple’s (AAPL) Siri, Project Astra offers a more creative, conversational tone that sounds more human-like. It’s even able to understand when you interrupt it, stopping to listen without getting mad. Not human-like!\n\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin, who was touring the I/O demo areas, said the technology behind Project Astra would have been helpful for the company’s canceled Google Glass, adding that the headset was 10 years ahead of its time.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Google’s announcement came a day after OpenAI debuted its own GPT-4o model, which, based on pre-recorded and live-streamed demos, is capable of many of the same tasks as Project Astra. What’s more, OpenAI is making parts of its GPT-4o model available to users for free, while Google says it will charge for access to Project Astra.\n\nGoogle also revealed AI updates to its Workspace productivity suite, including bringing Gemini to the Gmail mobile app. The feature allows users to quickly summarize emails and write contextual replies based on messages.\n\nAndroid, Google’s mobile operating system, also received its share of generative AI improvements, including scam call detection and the ability to add AI-generated images and more to text messages and Gmail.\n\nAs of now, that puts Google far ahead of Apple, which has yet to introduce generative AI features to its iOS operating system for the iPhone. But that is largely expected to change when the company hosts its annual WWDC event in June.\n\nEven if Apple debuts new generative AI offerings, it could still be a boon for Google, since, according to Bloomberg, Apple is working to use Google’s Gemini to power the iPhone’s AI capabilities. But Apple is also in talks with OpenAI. Folks, we've got an AI bake-off.\n\nFor now, Google appears to be back on top. While GPT-4o cooled some of the excitement around Project Astra, Google’s AI Overview for Search will expose far more people to its generative AI technologies than Microsoft or Apple when the latter shows its hand.\n\nBut with Microsoft preparing to host its Build developer conference next week, Google’s lead could be short-lived.

        "content": "Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger said the media giant plans to \"pretty dramatically\" reduce its investments in linear television as the company works to make its streaming unit a consistently profitable division.\n\nLast summer, Iger said he would take an \"expansive\" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling the potential for strategic options that could include a sale.\n\nThat ultimately did not come to fruition with Iger saying Wednesday that the company determined in its analysis that linear \"is not going to be a growth business but it could become an important component to our ability to engage with the consumer.\"\n\nIger said Dana Walden, who oversees Disney's television studios, and Jimmy Pitaro, who leads ESPN, have been tasked with reducing traditional network investments while also \"seamlessly\" managing the streaming businesses.\n\n\"You've got the same executives managing both, and their goal is to drive bottom line growth,\" he said at the MoffettNathanson Investor Conference.\n\nOne example of this duality includes placing episodes of \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Abbott Elementary,\" which air on ABC, onto the Hulu platform \"pretty quickly\" — or in some cases simultaneously.\n\nThe audiences, Iger said, are different with ABC's being \"older\" than Hulu. \"We're basically aggregating greater audiences and we're amortizing costs,\" he added.\n\nAlthough the executive said he still expects erosion when it comes to linear TV subscribers, the segment will \"continue to drive profitability because we're managing our costs so effectively.\"\n\nOverall, \"We feel comfortable with our hand right now because we're using those networks efficiently and effectively.\" Oscars show host Jimmy Kimmel poses with Bob Iger at the Governors Ball following the Oscars show at the 96th Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 10, 2024. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nLinear networks have been a pain point for legacy media giants across the board as a dismal ad environment drags on revenue, coupled with the mass exodus of pay TV consumers.\n\nPrior to the cord-cutting phenomenon, linear advertising and cable affiliate fees had consistently boosted revenues. But as ad buyers now flee traditional TV channels in favor of digital options like streaming, companies are beginning to realize that they may never see the same level of returns.\n\nDomestic operating income at ESPN fell 9% year over year to $780 million, dragged down by lower affiliate revenue and fewer subscribers as more consumers cut the cord, Disney reveled in its fiscal second-quarter earnings results.\n\nIt was a similar story for domestic linear network revenue within the entertainment division, which fell 11% year-over-year in the quarter. Operating income within the segment dropped 18%. This was also blamed on lower affiliate revenue, along with a decline in advertising revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nStreaming, on the other hand, turned a corner with the direct-to-consumer (DTC) portion of its entertainment segment, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, posting operating income of $47 million, compared to a loss of $587 million in the prior-year period.\n\nStill, all show business these days is tough, and the company warned it expects some DTC results in the entertainment segment to be in the red in the third quarter. But, Disney expects full streaming profitability by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google tackles phone theft with new safety features coming to Android",
        "content": "Google has unveiled a range of new features for its Android operating system designed to combat mobile phone theft and fraud, including a new AI-powered tool that can detect when a phone has been snatched from the owner’s hand.\n\nAs part of its updates to Android 15, the next version of the tech giant’s mobile operating system coming later this year, Theft Detection Lock will automatically lock a phone’s screen to prevent thieves from getting into the device.\n\nGoogle said its AI will be able to detect “common motion associated with theft” by reading signals from the device, such as the accelerometer reading the sudden jolt of someone on a bike snatching a phone from a user’s hand and then moving off at a high speed, to instantly lock the device.\n\nIt will be joined by a range of tools to better secure and hide apps which may contain sensitive data that would be of interest to thieves, as well as features to simplify the ability to remote lock a phone after it has been stolen. Remote Lock makes it easier for users to lock their device in the event of it going missing (Google)\n\nDave Burke, Android’s vice president of engineering, said the new theft detection tool had in part been inspired by feedback it had received from staff and users in Sao Paolo, Brazil, and London, where he said high levels of phone theft were being reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Some pretty scary statistics I learned fairly recently (were that) in Sao Paolo, a phone is stolen every five minutes, and in London a phone is stolen every six minutes,” he said.\n\n“That is a really serious issue, and we started thinking about it, what we can do, and we started studying (the issue).”\n\nHe added that the company had studied videos of phone thefts carried out on bikes to develop the new feature.\n\nIn October last year, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan held a meeting with tech companies – including Google, about phone companies doing more to help combat phone theft after a rise in incidents in the capital over the previous 12 months.\n\nThe new feature is being joined by other tools Google said “strengthen your device’s security against theft with new and improved protection features that will make thieves think twice about trying”.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt includes a new Private Space tool, which lets users create a separate area within their phone to place apps which contain sensitive data – such as banking apps – and can be hidden and locked with a separate pin.\n\nIn addition, Google is introducing a new Remote Lock feature, which allows users to lock their device remotely, using only their phone number and an additional pre-set security question.\n\nGoogle said allowing this process to be carried out using a phone number was because “many users are shocked and stressed after a phone goes missing and can’t recall their Google account password”, which is used to access the Find My Device app where phones can be remotely locked.\n\nThe tech giant announced it would also roll out new on-device AI tools that would detect apps that might be engaging in fraud.\n\nThe live threat detection tools will analyse how apps act and use the permissions given to them by users to monitor if they were engaging in suspicious behaviour, alerting both users and Google is any such activity is spotted.",

        "title": "The Next AI Bull Run Just Started: 3 Top Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend",
        "content": "Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology.\n\nJust this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s MSFT OpenAI, and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nAdditionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally.\n\nNew AI Product Releases\n\nOpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework.\n\nThe GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online.\n\nThen, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT.\n\nIn one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant.\n\nThe presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow.\n\nAgain, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos.\n\nStock Picks\n\nFor this next bull run in AI stocks, my favorite player is Alphabet GOOGL. Many analysts and commentators have been very loud about how Google is playing catch up in AI, or that GPTs are going to disrupt Google's search engine.\n\nThey have forgotten just how deeply entrenched Alphabet’s products are in daily life. Alphabet has nine products with more than 1 billion users along with the epic amounts of data and engineers to implement the new technology.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet enjoys both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, and a compelling technical trading setup.\n\nGOOGL stock just broke out from a bull flag and looks ready to make new YTD highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet also has also has a very reasonable valuation, trading at 22.5x forward earnings, which is in line with the market average and below its 10-year median of 26.2x. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMy next AI stock recommendation is not very original. Nvidia NVDA, has been and is the name to own for the trend in AI. The company is simply years ahead of other semiconductor producers, and its data center chips remain the key piece of infrastructure for technology being built with generative AI.\n\nNvidia also jumped back onto the Zacks Rank this morning with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates, with FY25 increasing by 7% in the last two months.\n\nAnd even with all the talk of Nvidia being wildly overpriced, the stock remains reasonably valued thanks to the massive growth of sales and earnings. Today, Nvidia is trading at 40x forward earnings, just below the industry average and its 10-year median.\n\nEPS are also forecast to grow at an incredible 30% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nNVDA stock, like GOOGL, also just broke out from a clean bull flag. As the leading name in AI, I would expect Nvidia to run to new highs in no time. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMy final AI stock pick for the next leg higher is Arista Networks ANET. Lesser known than the other two tech giants shared, Arista Networks is a leading provider of cloud networking solutions for large data centers. The company specializes in designing and delivering high-performance network switches and software-defined networking (SDN) solutions that offer scalability, reliability, and programmability.\n\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in providing the networking infrastructure necessary to support AI workloads and applications. As AI models become increasingly complex and data-intensive, they require robust and high-speed network connections to transfer data between servers, storage systems, and other components of the AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence boom has been and will continue to be a major boon to Arista’s core business.\n\nLike the others, ANET also has a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflected by strongly upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nArista Networks stock has actually shown relative strength during the recent selloff, and over the last two and a half months it has gained more than both Nvidia and Alphabet. Because I am a fan of momentum, I consider this relative strength to be very bullish, especially in this AI context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nDon’t sleep on the AI boom, because we are still early days. Keen investors will continue to be given opportunities to profit from this new technology, so keep your ears to the ground, focus on stocks with top Zacks Ranks, and be a prudent risk manager.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Google I/O shows why the search giant is sitting pretty against OpenAI",
        "content": "Google’s annual I/O developer conference kicked off yesterday, under the circus-like big top of the Shoreline Amphitheater, with improvisational musician and YouTuber Marc Rebillet climbing out of a giant Google coffee cup in a rainbow-colored robe. He stepped up to a DJ booth to show off Google’s new generative AI music tool, called MusicFX, with a demo filled with thumping beats meant to wake up, he shouted, the “silly little nerds.”\n\nIt was a surprisingly silly moment after several days of serious buildup to this week of AI announcements, which turned out to include a preemptive product launch from OpenAI. Social media amped up sky-high expectations about how OpenAI might steal Google’s thunder: An announcement of its own ChatGPT search? A surprise roll-out of GPT-5?\n\nFor a moment, it was easy to imagine Google getting, well, screwed by OpenAI's advance move. Or screwed once again, more accurately. After all, a year ago there were plenty of headlines like 'AI First' To Last: How Google Fell Behind In The AI Boom. After ChatGPT launched in November 2022, there were reports that Pichai had declared a ‘code red’ inside the company in response, so panicked was he about the threat OpenAI and its alliance with Microsoft posed to Google's business. From the outside, at least, it seemed like a humiliating takedown, considering that Google had been so far ahead in AI in 2019 that Microsoft decided to invest in OpenAI because it was “very worried” that Google was so far ahead in AI. And at 2023's Google I/O conference in 2023, the company seemed decidedly defensive, reminding the audience multiple times of how Google had been the first \"AI first\" company, and rolling out a slew of disjointed and not fully-thought-out product offerings and demos. The whole thing seemed rushed and designed to simply match Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nThis year was a whole different vibe. By yesterday afternoon, when both OpenAI's and Google's live-streamed announcements were finished—with nothing but memories left of OpenAI’s emotive-on-steroids voice assistant; Google’s rollout of AI Overviews in search; and several demos featuring dogs—it was clear why Pichai seemed so much more relaxed this year. It’s because far from screwing up on AI, Google actually is sitting pretty. Not only has it caught up to the point that its Gemini models are considered in the top-tier, but it has renewed confidence in the strength of a moat that OpenAI cannot easily cross: Google's vast consumer distribution across a deep and broad mix of products with billions of users. Many have accused Google of being bloated, bureaucratic and slow. But it has unparalleled scale.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Fan, a Nvidia senior research manager and lead of embodied AI, said it succinctly in an X post yesterday. “Google's strongest moat is distribution,” he wrote. “Gemini doesn't have to be the best model to be the most used one in the world.”\n\nOpenAI may have a technical lead—GPT-4 remains the state-of-the-art AI model to beat for certain reasoning tasks, for one thing—and as a startup with an $80 billion private market valuation, it may also be able to move faster than Google. But Google has Search, Gmail, Maps, Photos, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets and Android. By integrating generative AI into all of those products and using AI to tie them all together (for example, an AI-powered workflow that scours your Google applications for data to bring into Sheets and also your Calendar) it can keep users coming back for more. Even the Google search box already ties in AI across products, offering options to search photos, translate text, solve homework with Google Lens, identify songs and shop for products in screenshots.\n\nFurthermore, if Google’s distribution is its strongest moat, its secret sauce is arguably the massive amounts of data that flows through its products every day—petabytes from web searches, YouTube videos, Map requests, customer reviews, and much more. In addition to training its models, users can ask Google's AI features to dig through data stored in Google apps to help with an ever-increasing array of personalized tasks–basically using Google to Google your own Google.\n\nOf course, none of this means Google’s future AI success is assured. It may be able to rack up user numbers with its deep product bench and broad reach, but when it comes to revenue, the company’s business model is wrapped around Search. And it remains to be seen whether the rollout of AI Overviews in Search will cannibalize its referrals and ads business. It also remains uncertain how badly generative AI -created content will pollute the entire information ecosystem, resulting in worse search results—whether AI-generated or ranked links—and driving users away. In addition, while it can’t be as nimble and quick as OpenAI, Google needs to avoid tying itself in knots over being \"responsible,\" as it did during the “woke” image controversy around Gemini back in February.\n\nBut, it increasingly looks as though OpenAI will have to wage an uphill battle. If it wants to beat Google on consumer-facing AI products, it will have to show that it roll-out AI models that are better than Google's by a wide margin, and it will have to keep rolling those out to stay ahead. A rumored partnership with Apple to add ChatGPT to iPhones could help—Apple has the distribution OpenAI lacks, even with its Microsoft partnership. But short of announcing that the company has somehow reached AGI (whatever it deems that to be), Google has shown it will be very difficult to dislodge it from being the AI most consumers are likely to use.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tanking Profit Overshadowed Alibaba's AI Growth And Reignited Domestic E-Commerce\n\nOn Tuesday, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) reported its net profit took quite a dive during the fiscal fourth quarter, after already having a hard time throughout 2023 as it underwent its largest-ever corporate restructuring.\n\nFourth Fiscal Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, Alibaba posted revenue grew 7% YoY to 221.9 billion yuan, which amounts $30.7 billion, as it boosted domestic e-commerce sales. But, Alibaba reported its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders tanked as much as 86% YoY to 3.27 billion yuan, which is about $452 million, attributing the poor result to a net loss from investments in publicly-traded companies, compared to last year’s quarter when it made a net gain.\n\nEarly signs of reignited e-commerce growth.\n\nAlthough Alibaba is still grappling with cautious consumers in China amid the economic slowdown, its core e-commerce business has improved due to its focus on low-cost goods. Taobao and Tmall division that represent its e-commerce segment reported 4% YoY growth to 93.2 billion yuan, accelerating from previous quarter’s 2% growth.\n\nCustomer management revenue which consists of sales received from services such as marketing that merchants get from Alibaba, reported 5% YoY growth, also improving from being flat in the previous quarter. International commerce business grew 45% YoY 27.4 billion yuan.\n\nCloud growth fails to impress, but AI rose to the task.\n\nThe cloud computing division is having a hard time to shine. Last year, Alibaba decided not proceed with the spinoff of the division that competes with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud. For the reported quarter, Cloud computing brought in 25.6 billion yuan to the revenue table, posting the same growth rate of 3% YoY from the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, AI-related revenue reported a triple-digit YoY growth. AI-revenue came from various sectors, including foundational model companies, internet companies, financial services and the automotive industry.\n\nA Big Week For Global AI Development\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched its new AI model, GPT-4o. Through a livestreamed event, Microsoft-backed OpenAI demonstrated its latest effort of expanding the use of its chatbot and improving its capabilities as it made a significant step when it comes to ease of use. Microsoft-backed Open AI demonstrated the capabilities of the new model that is able to even perceive the user’s emotion, help calm a user down before making a public speech as well as read a story in a different tone or even sing it. OpenAI also touted the fact the new model can act as a translator even in audio mode. Moreover, by solving math equations and helping to write codes, GPT-4o  is a strong contender to Microsoft-made GitHub Copilot.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, Alibaba did report its profit plummeted, but its core business as well as the promising AI segment are growing, both of which are the main heroes of its storyline and future prospects.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Taiwan Semi Flags High Costs of ASML's Latest Chip Machines\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), one of ASML Holding NV’s (NASDAQ:ASML) significant clients, has expressed concerns about the high costs of ASML’s new advanced chip machines.\n\nAt a technology symposium in Amsterdam, TSMC Senior Vice President Kevin Zhang remarked on the sticker price of the high-NA extreme ultraviolet system, which can imprint lines as thin as 8 nanometers and costs €350 million ($380 million) each, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAlso Read: Biden Targets Chinese Imports With Huge Tariff Hikes Ahead of Election\n\nDespite appreciating the capabilities of the high-NA EUV, Zhang highlighted the economic considerations, stating that TSMC’s upcoming A16 node technology, due in late 2026, will continue to use older EUV technology instead of the new high-NA EUV machines.\n\nHe noted the rising costs of factory operations as a broader challenge for the industry, with increasing expenses for construction, tools, electricity, and raw materials.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC is looking to build its $11 billion European chip plant in Dresden, Germany, backed by EU and German support.

        "title": "Schumer’s AI Plan Urges Billions in Spending to Challenge China",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US needs to shield Americans from the risks posed by artificial intelligence while promoting the emerging technology with at least $32 billion in annual government spending to stay ahead of rivals like China, according to a highly anticipated policy blueprint from a bipartisan group of senators.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market How One of the World's Oldest Hedge Funds Went Bankrupt Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies Slovakia PM Robert Fico Shot in Assassination Attempt OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever Is Leaving the Company\n\nCongress should craft legislation that mitigates AI’s potential harm and funds research to boost US economic and national security, according to the plan released Wednesday by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. US companies including OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Meta Platforms Inc. currently hold the global lead, yet China’s race to develop highly advanced systems is putting pressure on lawmakers to craft a more lasting approach.\n\nFunding will “keep our companies, our universities, our workers at the cutting-edge and cement America’s dominance in AI, including out-competing the Chinese government, which we know is putting lots of dollars into this area already,” Schumer said in unveiling the 30-page document.\n\nThe blueprint culminates more than a year’s worth of activity on Capitol Hill to familiarize senators with AI, a first step toward eventually writing legislation governing the rapidly evolving technology. The senators last year held a series of closed-door forums featuring labor and tech industry leaders, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk of Tesla Inc., to examine AI’s vast implications for everything from national security to jobs to individual privacy.\n\nRapid developments in AI have fueled concerns that the technology could foment the spread of misinformation and expose consumers’ personal data. Executives from Google, Microsoft, IBM and OpenAI have urged more federal oversight to help guarantee safety, and three dozen venture capital firms agreed to abide by voluntary commitments after President Joe Biden in October signed an executive order that set initial safeguards and built on earlier undertakings from industry.\n\nPolicymakers in Washington have been seeking to build on that effort, seizing on the promise of AI to advance scientific discovery and solve global crises while also working to limit its dangers. Wednesday’s framework is designed to strike that regulatory balance and jumpstart legislative action, the senators said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir recommendations, especially on funding, will be a heavy lift to get through a bitterly divided Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces unrelenting pressure from conservative Republicans to cut spending, and lawmakers historically have a poor track record of regulating new technologies, further dimming prospects for results — especially during an election year.\n\nYet framing their plan as a way to counter Beijing may help their cause. Challenging China over economic and national security has been a rare area of common ground for lawmakers, most recently in a new law that passed with wide bipartisan support requiring TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. to sell the popular video-sharing app or face a ban in the US.\n\nSchumer struck an optimistic tone as he briefed reporters ahead of the plan’s release, saying he intends to meet with Johnson in coming weeks to find a path forward. His co-authors — Republicans Mike Rounds and Todd Young, along with Democrat Martin Heinrich — said they hoped their proposal sets up action as soon as this year.\n\nSome of the AI blueprint’s goals, such as safeguarding elections from deepfakes and misinformation, could find widespread favor in Congress given that lawmakers from both parties are vulnerable to such manipulation by foreign adversaries. The plan also calls for exploring ways to minimize the impact of job displacement as a result of artificial intelligence, including by retraining workers, while also doing more to shield consumer privacy and minimize bias.\n\nThe $32 billion figure for non-defense areas like health and energy was originally recommended in 2021 by the National Security Commission on AI, an independent board led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. A chunk of that funding would go toward agency-led research programs to foster more innovation. Promoting the use of AI in health-care is another area the senators urged fellow lawmakers to further explore.\n\nUS efforts to create guardrails lag behind other governments including the European Union, where the parliament in March approved the most comprehensive regulation of AI in the Western world. The EU measure bars using AI to detect emotions in workplaces and schools, while limiting its deployment in high-stakes situations like sorting job applications.\n\nIn addition to the Schumer-led blueprint, lawmakers have released several other bipartisan proposals that would, for example, bolster the government’s use of AI or protect artists from being mimicked by AI without their consent. The senators’ roadmap directs congressional committees to finetune and advance AI legislation, and calls out a handful of existing bills they support, such as one that would create a shared national research hub for educators and students to develop the tech.\n\n(Adds link to document and box summarizing highlights)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits The DNA Test Delusion US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports Elon Musk’s Big AI Contradiction\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 86%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are firmly in control on Wall Street. Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have respectively rallied by 19%, 36%, and 56%, as well as hit fresh all-time highs.\n\nWhile certain sectors and industries have played a role in pushing the broader market higher, the \"Magnificent Seven\" are attributed with putting the weight of Wall Street on their proverbial backs and lifting the stock market to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's view of the Magnificent Seven stocks is mixed\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from each of these businesses handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, they provide well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright moats within their respective industries.\n\nFor example, Alphabet's Google accounts for nearly 91% of worldwide internet search share, while Amazon's e-commerce marketplace oversaw close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are also the respective No.'s 1, 2, and 3 in cloud infrastructure service market share by enterprise spend.\n\nDespite the clear-cut catalysts the Magnificent Seven stocks bring to the table, not all Wall Street analysts share an optimistic view for their future. Based on bottom of the barrel price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three Magnificent Seven components could plunge by up to 86%.\n\nMeta Platforms: Implied downside of 24%\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven constituent that at least one analyst believes could meaningfully decline in the not-too-distant future is social media colossus Meta Platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski, who often takes a contrarian view on some of Wall Street's leading businesses, set a price target of just $360 on shares of Meta. This suggests 24% downside to come, based on the $476.20-per-share closing price, as of May 10.\n\nAccording to Slowinski, Meta lacks new revenue streams, when compared to the other companies spending big on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. This lack of new revenue channels, coupled with the company's forecast of higher capital expenditures tied to AI, have Slowinski believing Meta could underperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Meta is the undisputed leader among social media platforms. It owns the top social media \"real estate\" globally, including the most-visited social site (Facebook), and lured 3.24 billion users to its family of apps on a daily basis during the quarter ended in March. Businesses understand they're not going to reach a broader set of eyeballs on any other social media platform, which tends to afford Meta exceptionally strong ad pricing power.\n\nMeta Platforms also benefits from lengthy periods of economic expansion. Since it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, the company would be vulnerable to a recession. At the moment, a few key indicators, including a historic drop in U.S. M2 money supply, do suggest an economic downturn is probable.\n\nHowever, recessions are short-lived. All 12 U.S. recessions since 1945 have endured between two and 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth last for multiple years, and occasionally even stick around for a decade. Ad-driven businesses thrive during these long-winded expansions.\n\nA final reason Slowinski may be forced to eat his words is Meta's balance sheet. The company closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated north of $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations through the first three months of 2024. In other words, it has the capital to take risks and aggressively invest in its future -- even if the payoff from those investments are a few years away from being truly material to its top and bottom line. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 31%\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that one Wall Street analyst views as anything but \"magnificent\" is semiconductor behemoth Nvidia.\n\nBased on a February note issued by analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, there's concern about demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerating graphics processing units (GPUs) peaking in the current year. With the prospect of slower growth on the horizon, Luria's low-water price target of $620 implies a decline of 31% for Nvidia's stock over the coming year.\n\nOn the bright side, Nvidia's GPUs have come to dominate AI-accelerated data centers. With demand handily outpacing supply, strong pricing power helped to more than triple Data Center segment sales in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28).\n\nBut Luria hit the nail on the head when it comes to competition. While most folks might be focused on external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are both rolling out AI-accelerators for enterprise data centers, it's internal competition from Nvidia's top customers that's the far bigger concern.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four-largest customers and comprise in the neighborhood of 40% of its net sales. But these four giants are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if this is purely for complementary purposes, demand for Nvidia's high-powered chips would likely wane after the current fiscal year.\n\nWhat's more, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation over the last three decades that didn't navigate its way through a bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors overestimate the uptake or adoption of new technologies. Since no company has benefited more from the rise of AI, Nvidia would, in theory, be hit the hardest if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nLuria's price target on Nvidia is likely to be reached.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 86%\n\nBut the disaster du jour among Magnificent Seven stocks, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street pundit, is electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla. Gordon Johnson, the CEO and founder of GLJ Research and longtime Tesla bear, believes shares will reach $23.53.\n\nThis weirdly specific price target was arrived at by applying a multiple of 15 times Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) in 2025 and working backwards using a 9% discount rate. Keep in mind this price target was issued earlier this year, and Tesla's consensus EPS for 2025 has declined since then. If Johnson's price target were to prove accurate, shares of Tesla would implode by 86% from where they closed on May 10.\n\nTesla has made a habit of proving skeptics wrong. For instance, it's the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit. Tesla recently introduced its fifth mass-production model (Cybertruck) and has the capacity to roll out more than 2 million EVs annually.\n\nHowever, headwinds are most definitely mounting for North America's leading EV company.\n\nAs an example, increasing EV and hybrid competition has coerced Tesla to slash the sales price of its primary production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. CEO Elon Musk has been clear that his company's price strategy is entirely based on demand. But even with these aggressive cuts, Tesla's inventory levels have soared and its operating margins are tumbling.\n\nTesla's efforts to transform into more than just a car company haven't gone swimmingly, either. Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has slowed dramatically, while Services segment gross margin is consistently in the low-to-mid single digits. Meanwhile, more than half of the company's pre-tax income during the March-ended quarter came from unsustainable sources (e.g., interest income and the sale of regulatory tax credits).\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that Musk has proved to be a tangible liability for the company. Many of Musk's promises, such as Level 5 autonomy and robotaxis, which are already baked into Tesla's valuation, have failed to come to fruition. The longer these claims go unfulfilled, the likelier it is that Tesla's massive valuation premium to other auto stocks will deflate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Asian Stocks to Follow US Rally With Focus on CPI: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia are poised to follow a big tech-led rally in US benchmarks, as investors look to key inflation data later Wednesday for clues on the Federal Reserve’s next steps.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Biden Accuses China of ‘Cheating’ on Trade, Imposes New Tariffs Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies How One of the World's Oldest Hedge Funds Went Bankrupt Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe\n\nEquity futures for Japan and Australia pointed higher, while those for Hong Kong were little changed with that market closed for a holiday. In the run-up to US consumer price index data, the S&P 500 shrugged off Jerome Powell’s signals that interest rates will be higher for longer and a mixed reading on producer inflation. The report weighed on bond yields and oil.\n\nTesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led gains in the “Magnificent Seven” cohort of megacaps, as meme-stock traders once again piled into GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. US futures were little changed in early Asia trading.\n\nUnderlying US inflation probably moderated in April for the first time in six months, offering some hope that price pressures will start to ease again. Compared with April 2023, the core CPI is projected to rise 3.6%. While the annual increase would be the smallest in three years, it would still be too high to warrant rate cuts.\n\nA survey conducted by 22V Research showed 49% of investors expect the market reaction to the CPI report to be “risk-on” — while only 27% said “risk-off.”\n\n“Investors are expecting inflation to fall in April,” said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise. “Even if the decline is slight, markets are looking for further evidence that the downward trend in inflation remains intact and, importantly, is not in the process of reversing course higher.”\n\nThe S&P 500 rose to around 5,247, just shy of the March 28 closing level of 5,254.35 that would mark its 23rd record in 2024. Treasury 10-year yields fell five basis points to 4.44%, a Bloomberg gauge of the dollar declined for the first time in three days and oil slipped 1.4% in New York while gold rose. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index of US-listed Chinese companies slipped from a seven-month high reached Monday.\n\nUS producer prices rose in April by more than projected, though key components that feed into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge were more muted. Several categories in the PPI report that are used to calculate the personal consumption expenditures price index eased.\n\nStory continues\n\n“A more granular look suggests the components that feed into PCE inflation sent mixed signals,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore. “This means that the burden largely remains on CPI.”\n\nThe options market is betting that the S&P 500 will move 1% in either direction after today’s CPI report, based on the price of that day’s at-the-money straddles, according to Andrew Tyler, head of US market Intelligence at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s trading desk.\n\n“We believe that the stock market will move higher throughout the year on strong corporate profits and consumer spending, but volatility is likely to spike in the meantime, because the inflation data is going to keep the Fed on edge,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\nThe S&P 500 is unlikely to deliver any more gains from now through the end of the year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin. The firm’s chief US equity strategist reiterated his 2024 price target on the benchmark of 5,200 in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday.\n\n“The probability of a multiple expansion, while possible, is less probable,” Kostin said.\n\nWagers on rate cuts have sent investor optimism to a two-and-a-half-year high, but stocks will suffer if evidence of “stagflation” materializes, according to Bank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett.\n\nAccording to BofA’s global poll, a majority of fund managers see the Fed cutting rates in the second half of 2024. That has lifted sentiment — derived from a combination of cash levels, equity allocation and economic growth expectations — to the highest since November 2021.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nOracle Corp. climbed after the Information reported the company is close to a deal for a $10 billion cloud contract with Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI. Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it’s rolling out a version of its ubiquitous search engine that includes responses written by artificial intelligence, in one of the most significant overhauls since the iconic gateway to the internet was founded decades ago. Boeing Co. delivered 24 commercial jets in April, its lowest monthly tally since February 2022, as the planemaker slowed production of its workhorse 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner widebody to focus on improving quality. Home Depot Inc.’s string of negative sales extended into a sixth straight quarter as the big-box retailer struggles to overcome a weak housing market and lower demand for big-ticket items. Tencent Holdings Ltd. reported a far better-than-projected 62% surge in earnings while rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s profit plunged, highlighting the growing divergence between China’s twin internet powerhouses during a rocky post-Covid recovery. Comcast Corp. will offer customers a streaming bundle that includes Apple TV+, Netflix and its own Peacock service as it tries to reduce subscriber churn, Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said Tuesday at an investor conference. Hydrogen producer Plug Power Inc. surged after the Biden administration offered the US company a conditional commitment for $1.66 billion in loan guarantees to build up to six facilities. Verizon Communications Inc. is interested in buying back US Cellular Corp.’s stake in its Los Angeles business if the companies can agree on a reasonable price, the chief of Verizon’s consumer division said.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nChina rate decision, Wednesday Eurozone industrial production, GDP, Wednesday US CPI, retail sales, business inventories, empire manufacturing, Wednesday Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speaks, Wednesday Japan GDP, industrial production, Thursday US housing starts, initial jobless claims, industrial production, Thursday Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker speaks, Thursday Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks, Thursday Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday China property prices, retail sales, industrial production, Friday Eurozone CPI, Friday US Conf.

        "content": "*\n\nProducer prices up more than expected in April\n\n*\n\nFed's Powell: PPI 'mixed', next move unlikely to be a rate hike\n\n*\n\nMeme stocks extend gains, Home Depot shares fall after report\n\n*\n\nAlphabet advances after AI updates\n\n*\n\nIndexes rise: Dow 0.32%, S&P 0.48%, Nasdaq 0.75%\n\n(Updates with final closing prices, volume data)\n\nBy Sinéad Carew and Bansari Mayur Kamdar\n\nMay 14 (Reuters) -\n\nThe Nasdaq scored a record closing high on Tuesday and the S&P 500 and the Dow also advanced as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured investors while they digested Tuesday's data and waited for Wednesday's crucial consumer inflation report.\n\nU.S. producer prices increased more than expected in April as the cost of services and goods rose sharply, leading traders to pare back bets of a first rate cut in September.\n\nBut Powell on Tuesday described the producer price index report as more mixed than hot given that prior-period data was revised lower.\n\nInvestors were also encouraged by Powell's comment that he did not expect the central bank's next interest rate move to be a hike, despite a recent run of higher-than-expected inflation.\n\n\"The market is getting more comfortable with higher-for-longer rates. The real question has been lately if a hike is a possibility and Powell's reiterating that it's not on the table right now,\" said Lindsey Bell, chief strategist, 248 ventures, Charlotte, North Carolina. She also noted that stocks appeared to gain ground during the session as Treasury yields declined.\n\n\"It seems that the bond market is digesting all this and the stock market is reacting to the bond market,\" Bell said.\n\nStill, investors cautiously awaited Wednesday's Consumer Price Index figures to assess whether upside surprises in the first quarter extended into April.\n\nSticky inflation and persistent labor market strength have prompted financial markets and most economists to push bets for an initial Fed rate cut back to September from March previously.\n\nStill, stocks have rallied so far this year, thanks to better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter and expectations that the Fed would cut rates.\n\nWhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite easily cleared its April 11 record close, the S&P 500 ended the day around 0.1% below its March 28 record close. The Dow ended less than 1% below its record close, also reached on March 28.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126.60 points, or 0.32%, to 39,558.11. The S&P 500 gained 25.26 points, or 0.48%, at 5,246.68 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 122.94 points, or 0.75%, to 16,511.18.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong the S&P's 11 major industry sectors, consumer staples was the biggest decliner, down 0.2%, while technology was the biggest gainer, adding 0.9%.\n\nShares of Alphabet closed up 0.7% after the Google parent showed how it is using artificial intelligence across its businesses, including a beefed-up Gemini chatbot and improvements to its search engine.\n\nShares in Home Depot closed down 0.1% after falling more than 2% earlier in the day following the retailer's quarterly report, which showed that same-store sales fell more than expected as Americans focused on small-scale home projects, spending less on big-ticket items.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Alibaba ended down 6% after it reported an 86% drop in fourth-quarter profit.\n\nOn Holding rallied 18.3% as the footwear maker raised its annual sales forecast after beating quarterly sales expectations, citing strong demand for its running shoes.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden unveiled a bundle of steep tariff increases on an array of Chinese imports including electric vehicles, computer chips and medical products.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Chinese EV maker Li Auto fell more than 2% while Tesla gained more than 3%.\n\nGameStop shares extended their recent rally to close up 60% at $48.75 after flag bearer Roaring Kitty posted on X.com for the first time in three years.\n\nOther 2021 meme rally participants and highly shorted stocks also advanced with AMC Entertainment rising almost 32% to $6.85 and Koss Corp ending up 40.7% at $6.15.\n\nThe most heavily traded NYSE shares were AMC and GameStop. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.43-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 358 new highs and 31 new lows.\n\nOn the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.87-to-1 ratio and it recorded 171 new highs and 74 new lows. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and no new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 13.66 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.91 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.

        "content": "Google has been showcasing a wide range of new AI-powered products, as the tech giant stakes its claim to be one of the major players of the AI era.\n\nDuring a two-hour keynote event to open its annual I/O developer conference – and where the phrase “AI” was mentioned more than 120 times – the firm laid out how it would be further integrating generative AI into its most well-known products.\n\nHere is a look at the key announcements from the event.\n\n– Rebuilding search for generative AI\n\nGoogle Search, the most well-known part of the company’s business, is being revamped for the generative AI, Google confirmed. The event was held in Mountain View, California (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nIn the coming weeks, it will begin rolling out AI Overviews, a new type of search result powered by AI.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPowered by Google’s Gemini AI model, AI Overviews is able to understand longer and more complex queries and provide a range of suggestions in response, breaking queries into key parts and offering multiple perspectives from the web.\n\nGoogle says the aim is to “take the legwork” out of searching by providing a wider range of content in one place as new look search results.\n\nIt will begin rolling out in the US this week, with support for more countries set to follow shortly.\n\n– Project Astra\n\nThe name for Google’s vision for the “future of AI assistants”, Project Astra is the first experiment the company has done on a so-called “universal agent”. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google parent company Alphabet, speaks at the tech showcase (Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nThe idea is an AI assistant that is useful at any point in every day life and has real-time conversational capabilities while also being multimodal – able to take in any combination of text, audio and visual input and respond accurately.\n\nThe demonstration of this during I/O saw someone scanning an office space with their smartphone camera, while asking Astra to identify objects in the office, offer creative suggestions on things it saw and even remind the user where certain items where they had misplaced.\n\n– Veo and Imagen 3\n\nTwo major new content creation tools from the tech giant, enabling users to create either video or images based on text inputs.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said Veo was its “most capable video generation model to date” and can generate 1080p videos over a minute in length in a range of cinematic and visual styles.\n\nVeo has an advanced understanding of natural language and cinematic terms, Google said, enabling for more creative control.\n\nSimilarly for Imagen 3, Google said its improve understanding of language meant the app would be able to incorporate smaller details from longer prompts accurately and could also now better render text.\n\nThe company suggested this could all for the better generation of personalised messages and title slides in presentations, previously an issue for image generation models.\n\n– Gemini in Workspace\n\nIn a key update for consumers, Google said it was bringing its Gemini 1.5 Pro AI model to its workspace suite of apps, meaning users will soon have the ability to use Gemini within some of their most commonly used apps.\n\nThe Gemini era is here, bringing the magic of AI to the tools you use every day.

Stay tuned for more news in the coming months. #GoogleIOpic.twitter.com/wtc3rrk0Gc\n\n— Google (@Google) May 14, 2024\n\nMuch of the AI work would be done on-device, Google said, for better security, and a number of new tools would also be steadily rolled out, including a new scam detection feature that would analyse voice calls in real time and alert users if Gemini believed it could be a scam.\n\nMultimodality support via Gemini Nano was also coming to Google’s own Pixel devices, it was confirmed, allowing users to use text, image and visual prompts to interact with Gemini.",

Separately, the protesters held a rally at a nearby park.\n\nThe protesters, who call themselves No Tech for Genocide, have been demanding that Google end its cloud computing contract with the Israeli government, known as Project Nimbus.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking an additional 250 hostage, according to the Israeli government. Palestinian militants still hold about 100 captives, and Israel’s military has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nProtesters at the Google event said they believe the company's technology is being used by the Israeli military for surveillance of people in Gaza through facial recognition, leading to the arrest and detention of Palestinians.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company has said that its technology is used to support numerous governments around the world, including Israel’s, and that the Nimbus contract is for work running on its commercial cloud network, with the Israeli government ministries agreeing to comply with Google’s terms of service and acceptable use policy.\n\n“This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services,” Google said in an April statement.\n\nOne of the protesters at the Tuesday conference was Ariel Koren, a former Google employee who alleges the company retaliated against her in 2021 after she raised concerns about the contract. Google said at the time that it had investigated the case and found no evidence of retaliation.\n\n\"We want to make sure that every single person who comes here and who might think that today's a day about celebrating technological advancements — every single one of those people needs to understand that the reality is much darker than what Google has painted,\" Koren said.\n\nRead more:Google fired at least 20 additional workers after last week's Gaza protest, group says\n\nOrganizers estimated that 50 people participated in the demonstration in front of the conference. The rally at the park drew a bigger crowd.\n\nOne of the participants objected to Google holding its conference the day before Palestinians commemorate 76 years since their mass expulsion from what is now Israel. Palestinians refer to their displacement during the 1948 Israeli-Arab war as the Nakba, which is Arabic for catastrophe.\n\nThe protest in front of the Google I/O conference began at around 9:30 a.m., with protesters moving toward a bag checkpoint. Conference attendees had been asked to take out their laptops and have their bags searched.\n\nThe event's security closed the entrance as protesters moved to stand in front, leaving a large line of attendees who were later directed to another area to proceed to the conference. A line of protesters held a red sign that proclaimed \"Google Stop Fueling Genocide.\" The demonstration ended at about 11 a.m.\n\nGoogle's developer conference draws thousands of people each year, many of whom are developers eager to learn about the company's latest technology.\n\nAfter witnessing the protest, several attendees said they planned to do more research on Project Nimbus.\n\n\"I feel that it is worth a shot to listen to others when they have a point of view,\" said Andres Haro, a 30-year-old software security engineer from Utah, as he waited in a long redirected line into Google I/O's entrance.\n\nThe protest comes after more than 50 Google employees were fired following sit-ins and protests that took place at Google office locations last month protesting Project Nimbus. Google said it terminated those workers after an investigation determined they were involved in disruptive activity that violated its policies governing employee conduct.\n\nA spokesperson for the group behind the sit-ins, called No Tech for Apartheid, said they were not involved with Tuesday's protest.\n\nRead more:A worker objected to Google's Israel military contract. Google told her to move to Brazil\n\n\"We're asking more questions about what role we and our employers are playing in the world,\" said Roni Zeiger, a product developer who participated in the rally on Tuesday at Charleston Park, near the Google event. \"World events have continued to evolve and ... people, including employees, are asking harder questions and wanting to work at places that are consistent with their values.\"\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here Are My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is still a dominant trend in the stock market, but not every AI stock is worth buying. Now that the initial rush into these companies is over, you have to take a close look at them to see if they're worth buying, as some are grossly overvalued.\n\nThree AI stocks with bright prospects that don't carry an unreal premium are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These three represent some of the top AI companies available to investors. If you're looking to increase your exposure to AI, they are a great starting point.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nNone of today's AI technology would be possible without Taiwan Semiconductor. While there are other semiconductor manufacturers, few can compete with the scale and technology Taiwan Semiconductor offers.\n\nNvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple devices utilize Taiwan Semiconductor-produced (not designed) chips. Taiwan Semiconductor is a contract chip manufacturer, which means it takes designs from its clients and then produces them. With cutting-edge technology like 3-nanometer (nm) chips available, TSMC is one of the top players in this realm.\n\nIt's also starting to see an AI business boom. In its first-quarter conference call, management called demand for AI-related products \"insatiable.\" Management also forecasts AI revenue to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and make up 20% of its overall revenue by 2028. Furthermore, management's overall goal is to grow revenue between a CAGR of 15% and 20% over the next couple of years. This is massive news and gives investors a great reason to buy and hold the stock for the long term.\n\nAs for pricing, Taiwan Semiconductor can be purchased for around 23 times forward earnings. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile this isn't cheap, it's a fair price considering that the S&P 500 trades for 20.7 times forward earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor should grow at a healthy pace over the next few years. With the stock at a fair price, it's a great AI stock to buy now.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is likely better known by its platforms under its umbrella: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The primary source of revenue for these apps (and the whole company, for that matter) is ads. In Q1, 97.8% of revenue came from ads, so Meta must be at the top of its game to maintain its current business stature.\n\nTo improve its ads, Meta has utilized AI to pinpoint which ads are best suited to the viewer, creating better conversion rates. It's also introducing generative AI tools to step up its game further. With these tools, advertisers can create a base ad, and then the generative AI tool can change the background, adjust the image to better fit the device it's being viewed on, and vary the text to highlight things a particular viewer values more than another.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta also has other technologies it's attempting to develop that use AI and that could be profitable down the road, but if those come to life, it will just be a bonus.\n\nMeta's current business is thriving, with revenue rising 27% and earnings per share (EPS) increasing 114% in Q1. At 24 times forward earnings, the stock is a no-brainer buy.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet has some similarities to Meta Platforms, as advertising makes up 77% of revenue, thanks to its Google search engine and YouTube. It's also developing generative AI tools for advertisers.\n\nOne use is for clients that utilize Performance Max, a tool that analyzes an ad and has a set of requirements to ensure the campaign's performance has \"good to excellent ad strength.\" With Alphabet's generative AI platform, Gemini, integrated into this product, advertisers can instantly generate text that fulfills all of the tool's requirements, saving time and resources.\n\nAlphabet also has its Google Cloud cloud computing offering. This platform is one of the best for anyone looking to create AI models, and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth more than $1 billion) are clients of Google Cloud. This segment posted one of its best quarters ever, with revenue rising 28% and delivering an operating margin of 9%.\n\nAt 22.5 times earnings, Alphabet is the cheapest stock in this group. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nI think Alphabet is a great AI stock pick, as the tools it is creating are helping advertisers become more efficient and successful. With other areas of its business succeeding, too, it's a fantastic AI stock pick.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "The tech market has a long history of providing investors with significant and consistent gains. In fact, over the past decade the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector has climbed 416%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (which rose 178%).\n\nTech companies tend to benefit from the innovative nature of the industry, with never-ending demand for upgrades to software and hardware. As a result, it's no surprise that all five of the world's most valuable companies are tech firms, including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Amazon.\n\nThese companies have made many millionaires over the years, and will likely continue to make more. Consequently, it could be worth dedicating a portion of your holdings to the high-growth sector and potentially benefit from tech's development for years.\n\nHere are two top tech stocks that could make you a millionaire.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) still has a long way to go before it's in the same league as the top tech companies. Its market cap of $246 billion is still considerably lower than market leader Nvidia's more than $2 trillion. However, that's exactly why AMD has the potential to make you a millionaire -- it has plenty of room left to run.\n\nThe chip market is booming, with demand likely to continue rising as advances in tech increase the need for high-powered hardware. For instance, chip demand skyrocketed over the last year thanks to growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia scooped a majority market share in AI chips in 2023, with its dominant role in graphics processing units (GPUs) allowing it to get a head start in the sector.\n\nHowever, AMD has made a hefty investment in AI, which saw it launch rival GPUs this year. And its efforts appear to be paying off. The company posted earnings for its first quarter of 2024 on April 30, where revenue rose 2% year over year and beat Wall Street estimates by $20 million. AMD benefited from an 80% spike in its AI-focused data center segment, representing increased GPU sales.\n\nAMD's GPU market share rose from 12% to 19% between Q4 2022 and Q4 2023. Meanwhile, Nvidia's fell from 86% to 80% in that period. AMD is gaining in the industry and could be a lucrative long-term investment.\n\nShares of AMD have climbed 460% in the last five years alone, but could beat that over the next half-decade as it delves deep into AI. Meanwhile, AMD's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11 is significantly lower than Nvidia's 37, suggesting its stock is trading at a far better value than its biggest competitor.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nWhile AMD is a great way to add an up-and-comer to your portfolio, Alphabet's stock is a reliable option, with one of the most powerful positions in tech. In-house brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and Google resulted in a vast user base of billions of consumers and businesses. GOOGL Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe company's success over the years delivered promising growth, with this chart showing how its annual revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have risen high since 2020. Meanwhile, its stock climbed 143% in the same period.\n\nPast growth isn't always indicative of what's to come. However, Alphabet's future is bright. The company has used its significant user base to become a leader in digital advertising, with ad sales making up the bulk of its revenue. And now it seems that same user base is helping the company become a major player in AI.\n\nAlphabet reported its Q1 2024 earnings on April 25, delivering a 15% year-over-year increase in net sales and outperforming estimates by nearly $2 billion. The company enjoyed solid gains in its advertising business, with Google Services revenue rising 14%. However, the most promising growth area was its Google Cloud segment, which posted a revenue rise of 28% year over year.\n\nAlphabet gradually expanded its AI cloud services on Google Cloud over the last year, adding new tools and launching an AI model called Gemini.

        "content": "Google is expected to unveil a string of new artificial intelligence-powered features when it opens its annual developer conference later on Tuesday.\n\nGoogle I/O is the traditional launch point for major updates to the technology giant’s key products and services – including Search, Maps, YouTube and the Android software that powers many smartphones and tablets.\n\nThis year’s event in California is widely expected to see the company talk at length about how it is integrating generative AI into its products, having launched its revamped AI chatbot, Gemini, earlier this year.\n\nIn April, Google announced it had launched an experiment in the UK to test using generative AI to respond to some search queries, with the responses from Google’s chatbot showing up alongside the traditional search results and web links.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is one of a number of AI-powered features the tech giant has been testing and could be given a wider rollout during I/O. Reports suggest that Google is preparing to launch a new digital assistant on its Pixel smartphones at the I/O event alongside a preview of its next flagship device (Google/PA)\n\nThere have also been reports that Google could be planning to introduce a new digital assistant at the heart of its Pixel smartphones.\n\nIt has been suggested that any new assistant would have multimodal capabilities, meaning it is able to process, understand and respond to text, images and audio around one subject as they are fed to it.\n\nElsewhere, Google could use the event to preview its next flagship Pixel smartphone, which is due in the autumn, as well as other parts of its hardware line-up, including tablets and smart home hubs.\n\nThe announcements come as a new wave of innovation is expected around generative AI, particularly from the world’s biggest tech firms. Microsoft has its own developer conference next week and Apple’s follows in early June, with both also expected to heavily focus on their development and integration of generative AI tools.\n\nIt comes as questions and concerns remain around how to best regulate the rapidly evolving technology.\n\nConservative peer Lord Holmes of Richmond has tabled proposals to create a central AI regulator in the UK.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, the Government has proposed that existing regulators take on the role of monitoring AI use within their own sectors rather than creating a new, central regulator dedicated to the emerging technology.\n\nIn February, it announced that more than £100 million will be spent preparing the UK to regulate AI and use the technology safely, including helping to prepare and upskill regulators across different sectors.\n\nHowever, critics have warned this setup could struggle to keep up with the pace of change within the technology and leave regulatory gaps.",

        "content": "By Martin Coulter\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, which is backed by Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com, said it would release its generative AI chatbot Claude across Europe on Tuesday.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nAnthropic's Claude is a direct competitor to Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT, the chatbot that broke records when it reached 100 million monthly active users just two months after launch.\n\nWhile the Claude chatbot was already freely available online in a number of countries, this is the first time it has been made available via the web and iPhones across the European Union, as well as a handful of non-EU countries in Europe such as Switzerland and Iceland.\n\nEuropean business customers will also be able to access the \"Claude Team\" plan, which will cost 28 euros ($30.21) per month before value-added tax.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nAnthropic was set up by former executives at OpenAI and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei.\n\nEarlier this month, the firm jumped into the race to capture corporate dollars, launching a version of its chatbot aimed at businesses. The move could yet bring it into competition with its backers Amazon and Google, who likewise want to capture business spending on AI.\n\nKEY QUOTE\n\n\"Millions of people worldwide are already using Claude to do things like accelerate scientific processes, enhance customer service or refine their writing. I look forward to seeing what people and businesses across Europe create with Claude,\" said Dario Amodei, CEO and co-founder at Anthropic.\n\n($1 = 0.9270 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Video sharing platform Rumble said on Monday it has sued Google, arguing the tech giant has engaged in anticompetitive practices across its digital advertising products and sought damages in excess of $1 billion.\n\nThe suit alleges Google has monopolized the ad stack \"by buying companies up and down the chain, concurrently representing both ad buyers and sellers, while also running the exchange that connects those parties.\"\n\nRumble has accused Google of maintaining its monopoly by reaching an agreement with Meta's Facebook to prevent Facebook from offering alternatives to Google's ad tech ecosystem.\n\nGoogle denied Rumble's claims calling them \"simply wrong\" and said that Rumble utilizes \"dozens\" of competing ad services in addition to Google's ad manager.\n\n\"We'll show the court how our advertising products benefit publishers and help them fund their content online,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters, insisting that publishers keep a vast majority of the revenue when they choose Google tools.\n\nRumble filed the suit late on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nThis is the second time Rumble has filed a lawsuit against Google. The earlier suit filed in 2021 accused the company of favoring itself and its video-sharing platform, YouTube, in its search results.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department also filed an advertising lawsuit against Google last year accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business and argued that it should be forced to sell its ad manager suite.\n\nGoogle's advertising business is responsible for about three-quarters of its revenue.\n\n(Reporting by Akanksha Khushi, Costas Pitas, Eric Beech and Shreya Biswas; Additional reporting by Surbhi Misra in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "PayPal Is Holding Its Ground Amid Clash Of Digital Payment Titans",
        "content": "PayPal Is Holding Its Ground Amid Clash Of Digital Payment Titans\n\nIn recent years, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been struggling as Big Tech titans, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) expanded its footprint in digital payments. Even Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) is entering the credit card arena. The Robinhood Gold Card pitch is impressive, to say the least, and promises to give both Apple and PayPal a headache. But at the end of April, PayPal showed it is determined to reignite the growth story of its brand offferings while its unbranded businesses continue to grow, as it confidently lifted its full year adjusted profit guidance.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, total payment volumes grew 14% to $403.9 billion on increased global consumer spending that held up amid an uncertain economy. Net revenue climbed 10% to $7.7 billion. Aided by cost cuts, adjusted operating margin improved to 18.2%.\n\nA Lifted Outlook\n\nFor 2024, PayPal guided for adjusted profit growth in in mid-to-high single-digit percentages, while it previously forecasted it will remain flat.\n\nFocus on upgrades in attempt to win back investor support.\n\nPayPal is trying to woo investors by making efforts to become leaner as it focuses on achieving profitable growth. CEO Alex Chriss spoke of PayPal’s work to instill cost discipline, stating that management is “leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs”. While turning things around will likely take time and it is already taking longer than some expected, PayPal feels confident in its long-term opportunities as it already evolved from a checkout button to a platform of end-to-end solutions for both merchants and consumers. It’s no exaggeration to say that the digital wallet universe is a story of the clash of the titans, with PayPal going against Apple and against Google. Apple, Google and PayPal are competing for consumers’ wallets and the battle is as intense as it gets. Apply Pay is going from strength to strength, and it is also bringing the entire Apple ecosystem for the ride, seriously challenging PayPal whose days of dominating mobile payments are long gone. But PayPal is not giving its lunch to Apple nor anyone else by showing determination not to become obsolete. After all, it made a name for itself, and with a great name, it expanded into a supersized company, that on one hand is harder to steer, but on the other, it offers the broadest assortment of services to offer solutions that can supercharge a merchant's business. With its latest quarterly report, PayPal made it clear it will do whatever it takes to reignite growth of its branded offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "OpenAI Launches Faster and Cheaper AI Model With GPT-4o",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI is launching a faster and cheaper version of the artificial intelligence model that underpins its chatbot, ChatGPT, as the startup works to hold on to its lead in an increasingly crowded market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind GameStop Shares Soar as ‘Roaring Kitty’ Revitalizes Retail Frenzy Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk’s Cuts China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe\n\nDuring a livestreamed event on Monday, OpenAI debuted GPT-4o. It’s an updated version of its GPT-4 model, which is now more than a year old. The new large language model, trained on vast amounts of data from the internet, will be better at handling text, audio and images in real-time. The updates will be available in the coming weeks.\n\nAsked a question verbally, the system can reply with an audio response in milliseconds, the company said, allowing for a more fluid conversation. In a demonstration of the model, OpenAI researchers and Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati held a conversation with the new ChatGPT using just their voices, showing that the tool could talk back. During the presentation, the chatbot also appeared to translate speech from one language to another almost instantaneously, and at one point sang part of a story upon request.\n\n“This is the first time that we’re making a huge leap in the interaction and ease of use,” Murati told Bloomberg News. “We’re really making it possible for you to collaborate with tools like ChatGPT.”\n\nThe update will bring a number of features to free users that previously had been limited to those with a paid subscription to ChatGPT, such as the ability to search the web for answers to queries, speak to the chatbot and hear response in various voices, and command it to store details that the chatbot can recall in the future.\n\nThe release of GPT-4o is poised to shake up the rapidly evolving AI landscape, where GPT-4 remains the gold standard. A growing number of startups and Big Tech companies, including Anthropic, Cohere and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, have recently pushed out AI models that they say match or surpass the performance of GPT-4 in certain benchmarks.\n\nOpenAI’s announcement also comes the day before the Google I/O developer conference. Google, an early leader in the artificial intelligence space, is expected to use the event to unveil more AI updates after racing to keep pace with Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI.\n\nIn a rare blog post on Monday, OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said that while the original version of ChatGPT gave a hint for how people could use language to interact with computers, using GPT-4o feels “viscerally different.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“It feels like AI from the movies; and it’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real,” he said. “Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”\n\nTwo Times Faster\n\nRather than relying on different AI models to process different inputs, GPT-4o — the “o” stands for omni — combines voice, text and vision into a single model, allowing it to be faster than its predecessor. For example, if you feed the system an image prompt, it can respond with an image. The company said that the new model is two times faster and significantly more efficient.\n\n“When you have three different models that work together, you introduce a lot of latency in the experience, and it breaks the immersion of the experience,” Murati said. “But when you have one model that natively reasons across audio, text and vision, then you cut all of the latency out and you can interact with ChatGPT more like we’re interacting now.”\n\nBut the new model hit some snags. The audio frequently cut out as the researchers spoke during their demo. The AI system also surprised the audience when, after coaching a researcher through the process of solving an algebra problem, it chimed in with a flirtatious-sounding voice: “Wow, that’s quite the outfit you’ve got on.”\n\nOpenAI is beginning to roll out GPT-4o’s new text and image capabilities to some paying ChatGPT Plus and Team users today, and is offering those capabilities to enterprise users soon. The company will make the new version of its “voice mode” assistant available to ChatGPT Plus users in the coming weeks.\n\nRead More: Apple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone\n\nAs part of its updates, OpenAI said it’s also enabling anyone to access its GPT Store, which includes customized chatbots made by users. Previously, it was only available to paying customers.\n\nSpeculation about OpenAI’s next launch has become a Silicon Valley parlor game in recent weeks. A mysterious new chatbot caused a stir among AI watchers after it showed up on a benchmarking website and appeared to rival GPT-4’s performance. Altman offered winking references to the chatbot on X, fueling rumors that his company was behind it. On Monday, an OpenAI employee confirmed on the social platform X, that the mystery chatbot was indeed GPT-4o.\n\nThe company is working on a wide range of products, including voice technology and video software. OpenAI is also developing a search feature for ChatGPT, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nOn Friday, the company quelled some of the rumors by saying it wouldn’t imminently launch GPT-5, a much anticipated version of its model that some in the tech world expect to be radically more capable than current AI systems. It also said that Monday’s event wouldn’t unveil a new search product, a tool that could compete with Google. Google’s stock ticked higher on the news.\n\nBut after the event wrapped, Altman was quick to keep the speculation going. “We’ll have more stuff to share soon,” he wrote on X.\n\n(Updates with context starting in the third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges ‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "(Corrects spelling of director's name in paragraph 9)\n\nBy Anna Tong and Akash Sriram\n\nMay 13 (Reuters) - ChatGPT maker OpenAI said on Monday it would release a new AI model called GPT-4o, capable of realistic voice conversation and able to interact across text and image, its latest move to stay ahead in a race to dominate the emerging technology.\n\nNew audio capabilities enable users to speak to ChatGPT and obtain real-time responses with no delay, as well as interrupt ChatGPT while it is speaking, both hallmarks of realistic conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging, the OpenAI researchers showed at a livestream event.\n\n\"It feels like AI from the movies ... Talking to a computer has never felt really natural for me; now it does,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a blog post.\n\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI faces growing competition and pressure to expand the user base of ChatGPT, its popular chatbot product that wowed the world with its ability to produce human-like written content and top-notch software code.\n\nAt the livestream event, OpenAI researchers showed off ChatGPT's new voice assistant capabilities. In one demo, ChatGPT used its vision and voice capabilities to talk a researcher through solving a math equation on a sheet of paper.\n\nIn another demo, researchers showed the GPT-4o model's capability of real-time language translation.\n\nOpenAI's demonstrations verged on science-fiction, with ChatGPT and its interlocutor at one point engaging in coquettish banter. The OpenAI researcher told the chatbot he was in a great mood because he was demonstrating \"how useful and amazing you are.\"\n\nChatGPT responded: \"Oh stop it! You're making me blush!\"\n\nAltman posted on X after the demo, \"her,\" in what appeared to be a reference to the so named 2013 film by Spike Jonze about a man falling in love with his AI assistant, voiced by Scarlett Johansson.\n\nOpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, said at the event that the new model would be offered for free because it is more cost-effective than the company's previous models. Paid users of GPT-4o will have greater capacity limits than the company's free users, she said. The GPT-4o model will be available in ChatGPT over the next few weeks, the company said.\n\nShortly after launching in late 2022, ChatGPT was called the fastest application ever to reach 100 million monthly active users. However, worldwide traffic to ChatGPT's website has been on a roller-coaster ride in the past year and is only now returning to its May 2023 peak, according to analytics firm Similarweb.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI made the announcements a day before Alphabet is scheduled to hold its annual Google developers' conference, where it is expected to show off its own new AI-related features. Reuters reported last week that OpenAI planned to announce an AI-powered search product, citing sources. But the company decided to delay the search product announcement, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n\nShares of Alphabet were down 0.4% on Monday afternoon, after falling nearly 3% earlier in the day. Microsoft shares were down 0.2%.\n\n(Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco; and Akash Sriram in Bengalaru Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California, and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco Editing by Kenneth Li, Nick Zieminski and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple says privacy is a ‘core value.’ Tim Cook shouldn’t compromise it to bridge the gap on AI",
        "content": "For years, Apple has positioned itself as a champion of consumer privacy, setting itself apart from its tech industry peers Google and Facebook and their ad-based business models that rely on siphoning up as much user data as possible.\n\n“Privacy is a fundamental human right,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said last year, repeating a mantra he has made a central part of Apple’s marketing strategy.\n\nBut Apple’s privacy reputation is starting to show some major cracks—due to mounting revelations about its lucrative relationship with Google, which has been called “the pioneer of surveillance capitalism.”\n\nThe U.S. government’s antitrust lawsuit against Google has produced some eye-popping numbers. According to recently unsealed court documents from the trial, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to make Google the default search engine on its Safari web browser. That’s up from a reported $18 billion payment in 2021. A Google witness at the trial testified that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from search ads on Safari.\n\nThe details of these transactions, which both companies had taken pains to keep secret, do much to undermine Apple’s rhetoric about being a defender of user privacy. They lay bare how Apple, a company that calls privacy a “core value,” has been profiting handsomely from Google, known for its voracious collection of personal data. (Google says it does its best to protect user data.)\n\nFar from seeking to distance itself from Google in the wake of these revelations, Apple appears to be open to expanding the relationship. According to Bloomberg News, Apple has held negotiations to use Google’s Gemini generative AI tools to power new features on the iPhone. The latest reports indicate Apple may be close to a deal with OpenAI but is still talking with Google. Apple is lagging behind other tech industry players in developing generative AI, and such a deal would be a quick way for the company to leapfrog ahead with the technology.\n\nHowever, an AI partnership with Google would raise yet more questions about Apple’s commitment to privacy. A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed that Google quietly revised its privacy policy last year in an apparent effort to expand the amount of user data available to train its generative AI models—and released the new language on the July 4 weekend to minimize scrutiny of the changes. By tapping into Google’s Gemini for the iPhone, Apple would be associating itself with these tactics.\n\nWhomever Apple ends up partnering with on AI, the company must be transparent with its users about where their data will go and how it will be used. Apple forged its privacy reputation in 2016 during its high-profile standoff with the FBI over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino mass shooters. Apple famously refused the FBI’s request to unlock the device, warning it would create a “master key” that would break encryption and put the privacy and security of millions of Americans at risk. Cook called the case a “civil liberties” issue, putting privacy at the forefront of Apple’s corporate brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the years since, Apple has taken important steps to protect privacy, including features that require apps to get explicit permission from users to track their behavior and allow users to turn on end-to-end encryption for their messages and other data stored in Apple’s iCloud. But Apple’s deep entanglement with Google casts a large and growing shadow over the company’s claims to be a privacy savior.\n\nThe fact that Apple is financially benefitting—to the tune of billions of dollars—from Google’s privacy-invasive search engine makes Apple marketing slogans like “What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone” ring hollow. It also adds a distinct odor of hypocrisy to Cook’s frequent jabs at tech industry rivals over their data-hungry ways. At one 2015 event, where the Apple CEO was feted as a “Champion of Freedom” by a privacy advocacy group, Cook took aim at companies that are “gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it,” adding that “it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.”\n\nApple’s defense of the Google search deal basically boils down to: It’s not perfect, but there’s no other option. Testifying at the Google antitrust trial, Apple executive Eddy Cue, who negotiated the latest version of the search deal, said there “wasn’t a valid alternative” to Google. In a 2018 interview, Cook said Google’s search engine is “the best” and talked up Apple’s privacy settings for web browsing.\n\nThese comments suggest that Apple had no choice but to partner with Google. However, it is important to note that Apple’s relationship with Google goes beyond the search deal. Tech publication The Information reported in 2021 that Apple was the largest corporate client of Google’s cloud storage service. According to the report, Apple “dramatically increased” the amount of user data it stored in Google’s cloud that year and was poised to boost its spending on the service by 50%. The latest reports about Apple’s negotiations with Google over a potential AI deal suggest that Apple is willing to take the partnership even further. Apple’s customers deserve to know more about how the company’s dealings with Google affect the privacy of their data, particularly in light of Apple’s heavy marketing of itself as a privacy-minded corporation. It is clear that regulators are no longer taking Apple’s privacy promises at face value. The Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple, filed in March, observes that Apple “selectively compromises privacy and security interests when doing so is in Apple’s own financial interest,” giving the Apple-Google search deal as a prime example.\n\nKatie Paul is the director of the Tech Transparency Project.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nFannie Mae CEO: Beyoncé is right.

        "title": "Alphabet Is Reaping the Benefits of Cost Re-Engineering",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced its earnings for the first quarter of 2024 on April 25. Both revenue and net income exceeded the relatively modest market expectations. In CEO Sundar Pichais words, Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud. We are well under way with our Gemini era and there's great momentum across the company. Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.\n\nPichai expressed his confidence in Alphabet's ability to continue to grow its core business and leverage its technology leadership in the artificial intelligence race. Along with the earnings release, the company also announced its first quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. Obviously investors cheered the results as Alphabet's market cap has reached all-time highs again.\n\nFirst-quarter highlights\n\nAlphabet's first-quarter revenue grew 15% to $80.50 billion, exceeding the market's expectation of $79 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 31% year over year to $26.20 billion and the adjusted operating margin was 33%, a considerable improvement from 29% in the prior-year quarter.\n\nOn a segment basis, both Google Services and Google Cloud saw strong revenue growth. Google Services segment revenue grew 14% year over year to $70.4 billion. Within the Google Service segment, Google Search and other advertising revenue grew 14%, subscription, platform and devices revenue grew 18% and YouTube advertising revenue grew 21%. The only negative impact of the Google Services segment was network advertising, which was down 1%. The Google Services segment's operating income grew 28% year over year and the operating margin was 40%.\n\nGoogle Cloud business also experienced very robust growth. Segment revenue for Google Cloud grew 28% to $9.60 billion for the quarter. Segment operating income was $900 million and segment operating margin was 9%. During the earnings call, President and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat explained that the growth in the Google Cloud business reflected significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.\n\nThe most impressive part of Alphabet's first-quarter results is that the company achieved very high-quality revenue growth as its gross margin expanded to 58.14%. The last time Alphabet's gross margin surpassed 58% was in the third quarter of 2017 when its gross margin reached almost 60%. Alphabet's operating margin of 31.60% is also very high on a historical basis. This is the highest operating margin for the company since the fourth quarter of 2012.\n\nStory continues Alphabet Is Reaping the Benefits of Cost Re-Engineering\n\nRiding the AI wave\n\nLike all big tech companies, Alphabet also bets heavily on AI. During the earnings call, Pichai laid out Alphabet's leadership in six areas when it comes to the technology: research leadership, infrastructure leadership, innovation in Search, global product footprint, velocity in execution, and monetization paths.\n\nHe also said that that Gemini 1.5 Proincludes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet.\"\n\n\"Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code and more, it's highly capable,\" he added. \"We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others.\n\nOf the six areas that Pichai claims Alphabet has leadership, I am convinced the company is indeed a leader in research, infrastructure, innovation and global product footprint. After all, it did pioneer many of the modern breakthroughs that power the AI technology. According to Chatbot Arena, Alphabet's Gemini 1.5 Pro's ranking is tied at second.\n\nI am less convinced, though, that Alphabet can lead the AI race in terms of velocity in execution and monetization paths because, historically, speed of execution and monetization has not been its strength. But that may change as Pichai's leadership has set the tone for a company-wide effort to address complacency and sloth, both of which had been hindering Alphabet's speed of execution.\n\nCost re-engineering program paying off\n\nIn a previous discussion regarding Alphabet's culture, I laid out the challenges the company was facing when it comes to employees' complacency and sloth. At the end of the piece, I wrote:\n\nFortunately, Sundar Pichai has realized the culture issues and has taken steps to address them. It remains to be seen whether he can successfully tackle them in the future.\n\nAlphabet's recent actions are encouraging signs that the management team has been very effective in its cost re-engineering efforts. Investors can feel the sense of urgency from the management team. For the first quarter, the number of global employees decreased by 5.10% year over year to approximately 181,000. It is expected that layoffs will continue in the second quarter.\n\nFurther, on May 1, CNBC reported, Google is laying off at least 200 employees from its Core' organization, which includes key teams and engineering talent, in a reorganization that will include moving some roles to India and Mexico. This is another sign that Alphabet's management team is determined to further improve efficiency while maintaining its technology leadership.\n\nI applaud Alphabet's management team for their sense of urgency and determination in terms of tackling its most daunting issues. They are making difficult decisions that may not be popular in the short term, but are crucial for the company's long-term future.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet's first-quarter results handily beat investors' low expectations. But more importantly, the management team has showed investors they are determined to achieve high-quality growth. It is very encouraging to witness the steps they are taking to address its culture issues. While the journey ahead may be challenging, if the transformation is successful, Alphabet is likely to emerge stronger and more competitive in the long run.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Anna Tong\n\n(Reuters) - ChatGPT-maker OpenAI plans to announce on Monday updates to its flagship chatbot as its most advanced AI model GPT-4, which \"feels like magic,\" CEO Sam Altman said on X on Friday.\n\nThe company said on X that it will hold a livestream conference on Monday at 10am PT (1700 GMT) to \"demo some updates to ChatGPT and GPT-4.\"\n\nReuters last week reported that the Microsoft-backed startup was planning an announcement Monday of an AI-powered search product one day ahead of Google's I/O developers conference, citing sources.\n\nBut the company decided to delay the search product announcement, according to one source familiar with the matter. On Friday, CEO Sam Altman posted on X that the announcement would be \"not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! feels like magic to me.\"\n\nOpenAI is under pressure to expand the user base of ChatGPT, its flagship chatbot product that wowed the world with its ability to produce humanlike written content and top-notch software code.\n\nShortly after launching in late 2022, ChatGPT was called the fastest application to ever reach 100 million monthly active users. However, worldwide traffic to ChatGPT's website has been on a roller-coaster ride in the past year and is only now returning to its May 2023 peak, according to analytics firm Similarweb.\n\nGiving ChatGPT the search engine-like capability of accessing real-time, accurate web information is an obvious next step, and one that the current iteration of ChatGPT struggles with, industry experts have said.\n\nThat would also put OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which has announced generative AI features for its own namesake search engine, and well-funded startup Perplexity, which has gained traction through providing an AI-native search interface that shows citations in results and images as well as text in its responses.\n\nWeaving in real-time information has not been an easy task. An earlier attempt to bring updated and real-world information in to ChatGPT, called ChatGPT plugins, was retired in April, according to a help center posting on OpenAI's website.\n\n(Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco; editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "30 Highest Paid Jobs and Occupations in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 30 highest paid jobs and occupations in the US. We have talked about the highest paying industries in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paid Jobs and Occupations in the US.\n\nThe landscape of high-paying jobs in the US is largely dominated by tech and healthcare industries. In 2021, the average salary for technology professionals in the US increase to a record high of $104,566. Despite this increase, nearly half of tech workers expressed feeling underpaid. It is interesting to note that web developers experienced the most substantial pay raise, with salaries up by over 21.3%, while IT management positions commanded the highest average pay at $151,983.\n\nThe tech industry's highest-growth positions included database administrators, technical support engineers, and data analysts. As companies transition to the cloud, roles such as software developers are expected to continue seeing salary increases which also indicates ongoing demand for specific skill sets.\n\nAs long as the healthcare industry is concerned, healthcare jobs in the US have been a major contributor to job gains, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, the healthcare sector added 70,000 jobs, making up nearly 20% of the total additions to the American workforce. This increase in hiring has been attributed to a shift towards a more permanent workforce in healthcare facilities, as hospitals move away from relying heavily on temporary staff, such as contract nurses, which were in high demand during the peak of the pandemic.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that healthcare remains one of the highest paying industries in the US. According to Salary.com, the average salary for a General Surgeon is $432,400, making it one of the highest-paying roles within the healthcare sector in the US. An Anesthesiologist follows closely with an average salary of $426,800, while a Medical Director commands an average salary of $322,484.\n\nSpeaking of high salaries, US companies are observing a 33% increase in salaries for fully in-office roles that reached an average of $82,037 by March 2024, compared to $59,085 in 2023. This increase is essentially a push from employers to have their workforce back in physical offices. While hybrid and remote options persist, major corporations like Boeing and JPMorgan Chase are mandating full-time office attendance. The decision towards in-office work in the US, where 29% of paid workdays were still remote by January 2024, is driven by employers competing on pay rather than flexibility, according to ZipRecruiter.\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, in the UK and Europe, where remote work is less prevalent, the in-person premium trend is expected to be weaker. A survey in the UK in October 2023 showed that only 43% of workers had returned to fully in-office settings. Despite the cost-cutting climate, some employers are willing to increase wage bills for full offices as they believe it will lead to improved business outcomes.\n\nNevertheless, compensation in the tech sector has been largely disappointing in recent times. For example, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) employees have received news of smaller-than-anticipated pay increases, with some even experiencing a decrease in their total compensation packages. This news came during the annual performance review period, typically when employees at Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) learn about adjustments to their salaries, bonuses, and equity grants. Historically, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been known for generous compensation packages, but this year, many employees found their raises smaller than in previous years.\n\nReports indicated that some employees received base pay increases lower than 3% which is way less than the 8% to 10% increases seen in the past. Even those with outstanding performance ratings saw their total compensation decrease, primarily due to minimal raises in base salary, stagnant bonuses, and reduced equity rewards.\n\nOn the other hand, on February 14, 2024, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit alleging gender-based pay discrimination which affected approximately 4,000 female employees in California. The case was filed in 2017 and claimed that Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) paid male employees in similar roles up to $13,000 more annually than their female counterparts. Despite the settlement, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) did not admit any wrongdoing.\n\nThe settlement not only involved a major monetary compensation but also included provisions for an independent expert to review Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)’s employment practices to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws. 30 Highest Paid Jobs and Occupations in the US\n\nTop 20 Countries that Owe the US Money\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe found the 30 highest paid jobs and occupations in the US after researching the highest-paying professions in the US, from Indeed and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Throwing off more cash than they can spend, the shift to a regular payout provides more evidence for the companies’ financial strength.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone Ice Cube’s Big3 Basketball League Sells Its First Team in $10 Million Deal Trump Pledges Across-the-Board Tax Cuts If He Returns to Office How One Brooklyn Neighborhood Became a Nightclub Haven\n\nVarious technology firms have introduced quarterly payouts this year, and while the yields are small, the news sparked huge rallies as investors took the initiations as a sign the group can continue to deliver robust cash flows.\n\nAlphabet Inc. last month announced a dividend of 20 cents a share, sparking a 10% gain in the shares of the Google parent. Meta Platforms Inc. in February introduced a 50-cent dividend, which contributed to a historic pop in the stock. Salesforce Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. also launched dividends this year.\n\n“Dividends will be table-stakes for big tech going forward,” said Mark Iong, an equity fund manager at Homestead Advisers. “I think if you don’t pay one, it will now be taken as a sign your business is more volatile.”\n\nThe new dividends in some cases were accompanied by sizable buybacks, demonstrating a renewed focus on shareholder returns as artificial intelligence acts as a tailwind to growth, a combination that investors expect will continue to support share price gains.\n\n“What’s exciting is they are doing dividends and buybacks simultaneously, while also cutting costs and growing, which is them stepping on the pedal for profits across the board,” Iong said.\n\nAmong the so-called Magnificent Seven, only Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. don’t pay a dividend. “It will be difficult for Amazon to not follow suit,” Iong said.\n\nReached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the company’s recent earnings call, during which Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the focus is on capital expenditures and repaying debt, as opposed to shareholder returns. Tesla on its website said it doesn’t anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\nNvidia Corp.’s 4 cent per share quarterly dividend represents a yield of 0.02% and hasn’t been raised since 2018. The chipmaker generated $28 billion in cash last year and returned less than $400 million to investors in dividends and $9.5 billion in stock buybacks. Cash from operations is expected to more than double to $58 billion in the current year, according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Facebook’s parent company are up about 35% this year, while Alphabet is up 21%. Both have outperformed the 7.9% gain in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nHigh cash flow and solid balance sheets are a core reason why megacap technology stocks are well liked on Wall Street. The six biggest megacaps are projected to generate more than $416 billion in combined free cash flow this year.\n\nBuybacks Remain in Favor\n\nStill, repurchasing stock — which supports earnings per share by reducing share count — remains the favored way for these companies to return money to shareholders. The Magnificent Seven have spent almost $58.5 billion on buybacks this year, while allocating less than $11 billion on dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeta’s dividend came with a $50 billion buyback, while Alphabet’s was paired with a $70 billion repurchase authorization. Apple Inc. — which started paying a dividend more than a decade ago — last week announced the largest buyback in US history: $110 billion, exceeding the previous record of $100 billion it set in 2018.\n\n“These companies are still in the thrall of buybacks, and the dividend yields aren’t significant, but I think it is very telling that these companies are moving in this direction,” said Daniel Peris, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes and the author of several books on dividend investing.\n\n“As a dividend investor, a maturing company declaring a dividend is a good sign, but it is only meaningful if the yield adds up, and we’re not there yet,” Peris said.\n\nThe tech firm’s dividend payouts are relatively small, with the indicated yields for both Meta and Alphabet below 0.5% and Apple’s barely higher. To compare, the yield of the S&P 500 Index is 1.37%.\n\nStill, dividends are partially meant to encourage long-term ownership, and the impact compounds over time. Microsoft’s yield is around 0.7%, but that has added up. Over the past 20 years, shares have climbed about 1,500%. Including dividends, however, the rally tops 2,400%.\n\n--With assistance from Tom Contiliano and Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCorporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor ‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "The Surprising Reason the S&amp;P 500 Is Starting to Look Cheap",
        "content": "One of the easiest ways to get a reading on whether the market is overvalued is to look at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500. With a P/E of 27, the index looks expensive compared to historic levels.\n\nBut the market is forward looking and cares more about where companies are going than where they have been. Let's dive into some encouraging market data that indicates the S&P 500 might not be as expensive as it looks at first glance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe data\n\nNew findings from business data firm FactSet Research Systems show that 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. For the quarter, the growth rate for the S&P 500 is 5%, the highest level since Q2 2022. Earnings growth has been incredibly strong -- so strong, in fact, that the forward P/E of the S&P 500 is now 19.9.\n\nAccording to FactSet, that level is still above the five-year average of 19.1 and the 10-year average of 17.8, but it is lower than levels seen at the end of the first quarter of the calendar year on March 31.\n\nAccording to Luxembourg-based ISABELNET, a firm that has been doing private research on the U.S. stock market since 1998, consensus analyst estimates for the S&P 500 are $242 for 2024 earnings and $278 for 2025. At a level around 5,200, that would give the S&P 500 a P/E of 21.5 based on the 2024 forecast and 18.7 based on 2025 estimates.\n\nHere's a look at how the forward P/E has performed over the last five years and how it is expected to fall to around 20 by Q2 2025. S&P 500 P/E Ratio Forward Estimate Chart\n\nIn sum, growth is strong, earnings are delivering, and the S&P 500 is at a reasonable valuation.\n\nFaster growth justifies a higher multiple\n\nThe composition of the S&P 500 is currently more growth oriented than in the past.\n\nThe technology sector makes up 29.3% of the index. Consumer discretionary, dominated by Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), makes up 10.4%. Communications services -- heavily weighted in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- makes up 9.2%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which mirrors the performance of the S&P 500, has 30% of its weighting in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a term for seven top tech-focused companies that includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Nvidia alone now makes up more than 5% of the S&P 500.\n\nThe shift toward growth and tech has led to dramatic changes in the S&P 500 and fueled strong gains in the index led by megacap growth stocks. Growth stocks tend to fetch a premium valuation relative to their trailing earnings because investors are willing to pay up for the prospect of future earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith more and more of the S&P 500 allocated to growth stocks, it stands to reason its valuation should be higher than historic levels. By the same token, if the most valuable companies were instead safe, stodgy dividend-paying behemoths, we would expect the S&P 500's multiple to be lower than prior levels.\n\nTo see how growth can make an expensive stock look more affordable, let's look at the forward earnings estimates of the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNotice that Alphabet and Meta Platforms have roughly the same forward P/E as the S&P 500 despite being high-quality cash cows with above-average growth prospects and impeccable balance sheets.\n\nEven Nvidia, which embodies artificial intelligence-fueled market euphoria, has a 35.9 forward P/E -- which is less than half of its current 75.9 P/E ratio -- because consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings to double over the next year.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nThe stock market can do just about anything in the short term. But over the long term, it's all about how much money companies are making and how much they are expected to make in the future.\n\nIf you were to look solely at big tech stock prices or the levels of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, you might conclude that this market rally looks overextended. But earnings have delivered and are backing up the rally.\n\nThe lesson here is that price doesn't dictate value. Growth stocks were way oversold at the end of 2022, so there was some initial catching up to do in 2023. But the rally has persisted since then because of earnings growth.\n\nOverall, the stock market looks healthy and is going up for generally the right reasons. But there will always be pockets of speculation and greed.\n\nTo filter out the noise, focus on the underlying investment theses of the companies you like: their performance, what's driving or hindering results, and whether the valuation makes sense. This approach will help ensure you invest in a company for the right reasons and will allow you to stay on an even keel no matter how choppy the market becomes.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,115!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $34,588!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $329,437!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 6, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Kayak and OpenTable CEO Steve Hafner. Kayak\n\nThe Kayak website launched to the public in May 2004 as a pioneer in travel metasearch.\n\nWhen Kayak had its IPO in 2012, it was such a big deal in the travel and tech world that Skift published a live blog to follow every development.\n\nA few months later, Priceline Group – now called Booking Holdings – announced a deal to scoop it up  $2.1 billion.\n\nWe caught up with Steve Hafner, co-founder and CEO of Kayak and also OpenTable, on a Zoom call while he was in an Uber in Manhattan. We also exchanged emails with the other co-founder, serial entrepreneur Paul English about the 20th anniversary of Kayak’s launch.\n\nThe interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nDennis Schaal: So, Steve, why are you still here? Why are you still at Kayak?\n\nSteve Hafner: Because online travel hasn’t been solved yet. So look, it’s come a long way in the last 20 years. I think when we started, online travel really sucked. It just made the transition from offline to online, but it was still like a sea of blue links and nine flight results. When you made a change, you had to wait for something to load.\n\nIt’s a lot better now. 20 years later, we have mobile apps, we have thousands of search results. It’s pretty easy to buy stuff now. But it still kind of sucks, because it’s overwhelming – the amount of information now.\n\nI’m hopeful that 20 years from now, it’ll be a lot better. AI is a new technology everyone hopes will help it get there. But it still sucks. So until it’s fixed, I’m still going to be around.\n\nFuture at Booking Holdings?\n\nPerhaps Glenn Fogel (CEO of Kayak’s parent company, Booking Holdings) will retire soon (or eventually). Most founders, after they sell the company, they’re gone in a year. But you landed in this gigantic company with a lot of opportunities. So what’s ahead for you at Booking holdings?\n\nI have no idea. It’s never been about the job – it’s been about the product. We have this problem called online travel and we want to make it better. And we have a lot of unfinished business, so I’m delighted to still be with the company all this time.\n\nI wish we had completed the job and actually solved it, but we haven’t. As long as Booking Holdings is willing to have me stick around and I can be helpful to our team, then I’ll be here. It has nothing to do with my role at the company.\n\nKayak’s Early Days\n\nAny thoughts on the the early team that launched Kayak, and the process for launching Kayak? How you guys got started?\n\nThe alchemy of successful company is kind of hard to pin down but it starts with a good idea. A great team, sufficient capital, and then luck. And we got all those pieces put together at the right time.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo that original founding team was phenomenal: Paul English, Bill O’Donnell Paul Schwenk, Jeff Rago, but a bunch of guys. But I think the talent level now at Kayak is just as good as it was back then. If not better.\n\nWe emailed Kayak co-founder and former chief technology officer Paul English for his thoughts on Kayak after 20 years.\n\nPaul, any thoughts on the 20th anniversary of the launch of Kayak?\n\nPaul English: Hello from Rome. What strikes me most about the early years of Kayak is how lucky we were with the team we hired. It is not false modesty to say Kayak would never have been successful without the original team. I’m still a fan of Kayak. I use it all the time. If I were to work at Kayak again, I would turbo charge Trips. [For more about English’s career at Kayak, read this.] A photo of Kayak co-founder Paul English sitting on a chair on stage speaking at a conference.\n\nKayak vs. Google\n\nSteve, I mentioned to somebody on my team that I’m interviewing you around the 20th anniversary of Kayak. And they said to me, ‘Look, Google is eating their lunch, and Open Table has been overtaken by Rezy and others.’ What would be your answer to that?\n\nI’d say your colleague is misinformed. We have a very successful business, and OpenTable is a very successful business. Yeah, we’re not as big as Google is. But we never intended to be, and we’re having a lot of fun, we’re building great products.\n\nAnd we’re very profitable. Not a lot of companies get to say that. I remember my first venture capital pitch when we started Kayak. Because Google existed when we started Kayak.\n\nWe said, this is what we’re going to do: We’re going to build this metaserarch site, it’s going to find travel search results from across the web, because there were no mobile apps then. We’re going to direct consumers to the place where they want to buy, and we’ll make money that way.\n\nIt’s a big enough category that we can be a very successful number two. And that’s kind of where we are. And it’s never been about being bigger than Google. It’s about being better than Google. And we are better than Google.\n\nIn what way?\n\nIf you come and do a search on Kayak as a consumer, you’re gonna get better search results than you are on Google – more options, better prices, more accuracy.\n\nSo, go to Google to snack in a lot of categories, not just travel. But go to Kayak when you’re ready to buy. And, by the way, just to shift to OpenTable. Tell your friend that OpenTable has 55,000-plus restaurants and we fill 1.7 billion seats per year. We have a very profitable business. So he’s mistaken.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on whether Kayak is better than Google.\n\nSelling to Priceline\n\nDo you think Kayak would have done better if you had stayed independent? A lot of times brands get lost within larger companies. Do you think Kayak might have done better on its own?\n\nAbsolutely not. When when they bought us, we were in five countries and three languages. Now we’re in 60 countries and 25 languages that let us operate independently. We’ve done $700 million worth of acquisitions since then. We haven’t been distracted by public markets.\n\nJust just take a look at Trivago or Tripadvisor? They’re independent — how well are they doing?\n\nBeing independent is overrated. We’ve been able to do anything we’ve wanted to do. Glenn and BHI (Booking Holdings Inc.) have been very supportive of our mission. And it’s been a pleasure being part of the bigger group.\n\nLearnings From Kayak Hotels\n\nHow do you look back on your foray into Kayak Hotels at this point? [Kayak opened three Kayak-branded hotels but exited the business after around two years in late 2022.]\n\nIt was worth a try. One of the things that’s that’s a hallmark of Kayak is we’ve never shied away from being innovative and taking risks and Kayak Hotels was a big risk.\n\nBut at the time, you have to remember, Sonder and Selena and a bunch of other companies were pursuing this space. And so we thought we’d take a sniff, too.\n\nAnd what we quickly learned is there’s a reason OpenTable doesn’t have restaurants, there’s a reason Kayak doesn’t have hotels. Because the actual guest experience involves a lot more than just great technology. And as we got into it — everything we do at Kayak is test, learn and then scale — Kayak Hotels never got past the learn scales. We quickly learned it’s not a great business to be in.\n\nWhen you say OpenTable doesn’t have restaurants do you mean OpenTable doesn’t own restaurants?\n\nOpenTable doesn’t operate restaurants. Its sweet-spot is software. And we learned that Kayak’s sweet-spot is software, as well.\n\nWas OpenTable a Good Deal?\n\nDo you think it was a mistake for Booking to buy OpenTable? Because at the time, everybody was talking about the synergy between travel and dining? It seems logical, but it hasn’t really worked out like that.\n\nOpenTable was a great acquisition. It’s a phenomenal company. It hasn’t had the synergies that we had hoped with with Booking.com because dining and accommodations are fundamentally different. Most dining is local. It’s not travelers. You don’t use the Booking.com app to book a restaurant. You use the OpenTable app.\n\nIt’s been an accretive acquisition, let’s leave it at that. And, personally, I wish they hadn’t paid more for OpenTable [$2.6 billion in 2014] than they paid for Kayak [$2.1 billion in 2013] because Kayak’s a more profitable company. But it is what it is.\n\nAccomplishments and Regrets\n\nWhat would you say would be the three big accomplishments at Kayak and OpenTable over the last year?\n\nOn the Kayak side, we’ve always done the consumer site and meta really well. Since 2021, we’ve been working on Kayak Hotels, which didn’t pan out, but there’s also Kayak for Business.\n\nI think Kayak for Business now is actually on a great track. So we’ve got three big enterprise clients: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tripadvisor, and Diageo. And we’ve got more coming. And then we’ve got 30,000 small accounts that have self signed up and are using the site.\n\nAre you doing managed travel?\n\nBusinesses can use us to see where all their employees are traveling. You can upload your own business travel policy and negotiated rates. And then the coolest thing is no expense reports need to be filed and no credit card that needs to be used.\n\nYou don’t need your own personal credit card; we have a virtual credit card. And then it’s direct billing via the blockchain right back to like American Airlines, for example. So they save the 2% processing charge on on credit cards.\n\nAnd how’s the blockchain used?\n\nSo that’s the ledger for where a transaction happens and the last person to touch it. So if you’re a traveler, and you book on Kayak, you may [actually] be booking on AA.com. And if you use a corporate travel agency to change the itinerary that gets fed into the blockchain. There’s a digital ledger.\n\nSo any contact point knows exactly what’s happened throughout the the customers journey. It’s pretty cool stuff.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest regrets about Kayak and some of the things that you’re most proud of about Kayak?\n\nWe had the opportunity to buy 25% of Uber early on, and we did not do that. Which is a pretty big regret. I think we might have sold a little too early. I’m glad we sold. But that’s turned out OK, as well.\n\nAnd then an early days thing was we started the website with Adobe Flash? We shouldn’t have done that. That cost us about a year of development work.\n\nBut overall, we’ve been successful the last 20 years, I don’t have a lot of regrets. We’ve been extremely fortunate. We’ve had a great team, and had a great run. And I expect the next 20 years could be as good, if not better.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 best AI content detectors in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best AI Content Detectors in 2024.\n\nAn Analysis of the AI Content Creation Market\n\nContent Marketing is a dynamic strategy that utilizes digital tools including text, images, videos, audio, and infographics to market content and services and retain potential audiences. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global content marketing industry is expected to reach $263.09 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.75% during the forecasted period to reach $523.45 billion by 2029. Two of the leading factors driving growth in the industry are; the growing demand for digital transformation and online presence for business and the rise of AI-based content marketing.\n\nThe global content marketing industry was revolutionized in 2022 due to the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on November 30, 2022. ChatGPT is a large language model that uses Natural Language Processing (NPL) to produce human-like dialogue form responses to user's requests. The platform immediately gained attention and was used by over a million people during the first 5 days of its release. The number of ChatGPT users has increased drastically. According to the results from Similarweb recorded on 10th May 2024, the platform was visited by 1.8 billion people during the past 28 days. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI led other leading technology companies to develop and release their language models. Subsequently, Gemini, Copilot, and Ernie were released by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), respectively.\n\nThese platforms have fostered growth in the AI content creation tool market. According to a report by Future Market Insights, the AI content creation tools market was valued at $840.3 million in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.60% during the forecasted period to reach $3.01 billion by 2034. Looking at country-wise growth rates, the United States market is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 10.5% mainly due to its highly digitized economy and a wide range of businesses with a growing online presence.

However, the world soon realized the limitations and potential issues linked to AI-generated content. The content generated using artificial intelligence software is redundant, based on hallucinated facts or imagined facts, spammy, and mostly plagiarized. On February 8, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) released its policy about AI-generated content stating that the appropriate use of AI or automation is not against Google’s policies, however content generated to spam and manipulate the search engine ranking is against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) spam policy and will be penalized.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the Leading Tech Companies Developing AI Content Generators\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are two of the leading tech companies developing AI content generators. If you want to read more about AI companies you can look at 16 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the developer of the large language model, Gemini. On February 22, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) paused image generation at its AI platform Gemini due to inaccurate results for some historical depictions. Google started offering image generation using generative AI technology through Gemini during the initial days of February 2024. The tool was updated and on February 26th Google reported that it planned to relaunch the tool after fixing it. Here are some comments related to Gemini from Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large -scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini’s native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code, and more, it’s highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models, as well as imagine visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era.\"\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading technology company and the maker of Copilot, a large language model-based AI Chatbot. On March 30, Reuters reported that the US Congress has banned its staff from using Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI Copilot due to the risk of leaking data to non-House approved cloud servers. In response, the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has announced a roadmap for its AI tools that meet the federal government’s security criteria and is intended to be delivered later this year. Moreover, over the last two years, two Democratic and two Republican senators have introduced legislation to ban the use of AI that creates false content depicting candidates related to federal election campaigns.\n\nNow that we have discussed the rise of AI content-generating platforms and their limitations, let’s look at the 20 Best AI Content Detectors in 2024 that can help you differentiate between AI-written and human-written content. 20 Best AI Content Detectors in 2024\n\nA software developer looking out a window while confidently typing away on their laptop.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe employed a consensus methodology to curate the list of 20 best AI content detectors in 2024.

        "title": "Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock?",
        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n\n28% = US$82b ÷ US$293b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.28 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Growth And 28% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 7.4% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Alphabet was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Alphabet's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 6.0% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is GOOGL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Alphabet Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Since this decade kicked off, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.\n\nThis volatility has been especially pronounced in the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC). After shedding a third of its value during the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite has skyrocketed 56% since the start of 2023. It also hit a fresh all-time high in April, which confirms that we're in a relatively new bull market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe interesting thing about bull markets is that phenomenal deals can always be found -- you just have to be willing to look for them. With artificial intelligence (AI) stocks responsible for a sizable portion of the Nasdaq's gains, it means growth stock bargains elsewhere are still flying under the radar.\n\nWhat follows are four preeminent growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first prominent growth stock you'll be upset with yourself for not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq marching to new highs is the \"Magnificent Seven\" component Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Alphabet is the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming site YouTube, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, among other ventures.\n\nThe only true weakness Alphabet has shown is that it's cyclical. Nearly 77% of the $80.5 billion in sales the company generated in the quarter ended in March came from advertising. During recessions, it's pretty common for businesses to quickly pare back their advertising budgets, which would leave Alphabet temporarily vulnerable to downside.\n\nHowever, this \"crutch\" is also one of Alphabet's top catalysts. You see, even though recessions are a perfectly normal and unavoidable part of the economic cycle, they've historically resolved rather quickly. This means Alphabet's ad-centric operating segments -- including Google, which accounted for a roughly 91% share of global internet search share in April -- get to enjoy lengthy periods of economic expansion.\n\nPerhaps the bigger story has been the ascension of Google Cloud, which has become the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform by spend as of September 2023. Google Cloud is pacing more than $38 billion in annual run-rate sales and has delivered five consecutive quarters of operating income after years of losses. It's quickly becoming the cash cow investors have long dreamed it would be.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe steady long-term expansion of Alphabet's ad segments, coupled with the rapid growth of Google Cloud, should allow Alphabet's cash flow per share to expand by more than 50% between 2023 and 2026. Relative to its future cash flow, Alphabet remains historically cheap.\n\nPubMatic\n\nA second preeminent growth stock you'll regret not scooping up with the Nasdaq entering a fresh bull market is cloud-based programmatic adtech company PubMatic(NASDAQ: PUBM).\n\nSimilar to Alphabet, the prevailing concern for PubMatic is the health of the U.S. and global economies. Thankfully, no recession since the end of World War II has surpassed 18 months in duration. Comparatively, two periods of expansion endured longer than 10 years. This disparity in economic growth is what allows advertising-based businesses like PubMatic to thrive.\n\nHowever, the real \"secret\" to PubMatic's success is its focus on digital advertising. Businesses are undeniably shifting their advertising dollars away from traditional print and billboards and toward video, mobile, and connected TV (CTV). The latter has been a particularly fast-growing channel for PubMatic, positioning the company for sustained double-digit sales and profit growth. During the quarter that ended in March, omnichannel video sales, which includes CTV, jumped by 33% from the prior year.\n\nAside from being at the center of the fastest-growing trend within advertising, management also deserves kudos for avoiding the easy solution and choosing to build out its cloud-based infrastructure. While it would have been quick to simply lean on an existing third-party platform, developing its own cloud-based programmatic ad platform is now allowing the company to hang on to more of its revenue as it scales. This is a recipe for a sustainably higher operating margin over time.\n\nThe final selling point with PubMatic is its balance sheet. It closed out the quarter ending in March with $174.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and no debt. It's been using this cash to buy back its own stock, which should provide a modest lift to earnings per share (EPS). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNOV\n\nThe third incredible growth stock you'll wish you added to your portfolio with the Nasdaq in the early stages of a bull market is oil and gas equipment services company NOV(NYSE: NOV).\n\nAdmittedly, some investors are going to be turned off by the idea of putting their money to work in the oil and gas industry. Aside from being considered a \"sin\" industry, the oil and gas industry was walloped by a historic demand drop-off for energy commodities during the initial stages of COVID-19 lockdowns four years ago. That still-fresh memory has kept select investors on the sidelines.\n\nBut what's interesting for NOV is that this uncertainty has created an almost ideal growth scenario for the company. Approximately three years of reduced capital spending by global energy majors, coupled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has constrained the global supply of oil -- and there's no quick fix. With the spot price of crude oil elevated and expected to remain above its historic average for the foreseeable future, NOV should benefit from increased drilling demand.\n\nI'll also add that NOV has the ability to thrive in virtually any economic climate. There aren't too many alternatives to the services NOV provides to onshore/offshore drillers and fracking companies. Further, it's able to benefit from onshore/offshore wind turbine installation. NOV closed out the first quarter with nearly $4 billion in backlogged equipment orders.\n\nLastly, the valuation is hard to ignore. Despite the challenges the oil industry has contended with since this decade began, NOV's EPS is expected to increase 69% to $2.16 between 2023 and 2026. With its shares trading near $19, you can get a true feel for how much of a deal investors are getting right now with this oilfield equipment services provider.\n\nBlock\n\nA fourth preeminent growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is none other than financial technology (fintech) leader Block(NYSE: SQ). While there's been some concern about increased competition in the digital payment arena, Block's key performance indicators have had no trouble putting skeptics in their place.\n\nFor over a decade, Block's foundation has been its Square ecosystem (it was originally known as \"Square\" before changing its name). This is the segment that provides point-of-sale solutions, data analytics, and loans to merchants. The quarter ended in March saw the Square ecosystem handle $50.5 billion in gross payment volume (GPV), or $202 billion on an annualized run-rate basis. For some context, the entire platform handled less than $7 billion GPV in 2012.\n\nBut what really hits home about the Square ecosystem is that its point-of-sale solutions are reaching larger businesses. Approximately 39% of the $50.5 billion in GPV in the first quarter can be traced back to businesses with at least $500,000 in annualized GPV. That's up four percentage points from the comparable period in 2022. Since this is predominantly a fee-driven platform, bigger businesses should have a more meaningful and positive impact on this segment's gross profit.\n\nLooking to the horizon, digital payments platform Cash App may be an even more prolific cash-flow generator for Block. The company notes that it had 57 million monthly transacting active customers in the quarter that ended in March, as well as 24 million Cash App active cardholders -- the Cash App card links directly to a user's Cash App balance. The gross profit Block is generating from each Cash App active user is significantly higher than the cost to acquire these users.\n\nConsensus estimates call for Block to more than triple its EPS over the next three years. With a sustained double-digit growth rate, this makes Block one heck of a bargain among growth stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Red, yellow, green ... and white? Smarter vehicles could mean big changes for the traffic light",
        "content": "As cars and trucks get smarter and more connected, the humble lights that have controlled the flow of traffic for more than a century could also be on the cusp of a major transformation.\n\nResearchers are exploring ways to use features in modern cars, such as GPS, to make traffic safer and more efficient. Eventually, the upgrades could do away entirely with the red, yellow and green lights of today, ceding control to driverless cars.\n\nHenry Liu, a civil engineering professor who is leading a study through the University of Michigan, said the rollout of a new traffic signal system could be a lot closer than people realize.\n\n“The pace of artificial intelligence progress is very fast, and I think it’s coming,” he said.\n\nTraffic lights haven’t changed much in the U.S. over the years. Cleveland debuted what is considered the first “municipal traffic control system” in 1914, historian Megan Kate Nelson wrote for Smithsonian Magazine. Powered by the electricity from the city’s trolley line, engineer James Hodge’s invention featured two lights: red and green, the colors long used by railroads. A police officer sitting in a booth on the sidewalk had to flip a switch to change the signal.\n\nA few years later, Detroit police officer William Potts is credited with adding the yellow light, though as a city employee he couldn’t patent it. By 1930, Nelson wrote, all major American cities and many smaller ones had at least one electrical traffic signal.\n\nThe advent of connected and automated vehicles, though, has presented a world of new possibilities for traffic signals.\n\nAmong those reimagining traffic flows is a team at North Carolina State University led by Ali Hajbabaie, an associate engineering professor. Rather than doing away with today's traffic signals, Hajbabaie suggests adding a fourth light, perhaps a white one, to indicate when there are enough autonomous vehicles on the road to take charge and lead the way.\n\n“When we get to the intersection, we stop if it's red and we go if it's green,\" said Hajbabaie, whose team used model cars small enough to hold. “But if the white light is active, you just follow the vehicle in front of you.”\n\nAlthough Hajbabaie's research refers to a “white phase” and possibly even a white light, the specific color isn’t important, he said. Current lights could even suffice, say, by modifying them to flash red and green simultaneously to signal that driverless cars are in charge. The key would be making sure that it's universally adopted like the current signals are.\n\nUsing such an approach would be years away, as it would require 40% to 50% of vehicles on the road to be self-driving in order to work, Hajbabaie acknowledged.\n\nStory continues\n\nWaymo spokesperson Sandy Karp pointed out that the self-driving car subsidiary of Google's parent company launched a fully autonomous ride-sharing service in Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, even without the addition of a fourth traffic light.\n\n“While it is good at this early stage of AV development that people are thinking creatively about how to facilitate the safe deployment of safe AVs, policymakers and infrastructure owners should be careful about jumping too soon on AV-specific investments that may turn out to be premature or even unnecessary,” Karp said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nUniversity of Michigan researchers have taken a different approach. They conducted a pilot program in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham using insights from the speed and location data found in General Motors vehicles to alter the timing of that city’s traffic lights. The researchers recently landed a U.S. Department of Transportation grant under the bipartisan infrastructure law to test how to make the changes in real time.\n\nBecause the Michigan research deals with vehicles that have drivers, not fully autonomous ones, it could be much closer to wider implementation than what Hajbabaie is seeking.\n\nLiu, who has been leading the Michigan research, said even with as little as 6% of the vehicles on Birmingham’s streets connected to the GM system, they provide enough data to adjust the timing of the traffic lights to smooth the flow.\n\nThe 34 traffic signals in Birmingham were chosen because, like more than half of the signals nationwide, they’re set to a fixed-time schedule without any cameras or sensors to monitor congestion. Liu said although there are higher-tech solutions to monitoring traffic, they require cities to make complex and expensive upgrades.\n\n“The beauty of this is you don’t have to do anything to the infrastructure,” Liu said. “The data is not coming from the infrastructure. It’s coming from the car companies.”\n\nDanielle Deneau, director of traffic safety at the Road Commission in Oakland County, Michigan, said the initial data in Birmingham only adjusted the timing of green lights by a few seconds, but it was still enough to reduce congestion. Even bigger changes could be in store under the new grant-funded research, which would automate the traffic lights in a yet-to-be announced location in the county.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best marketing stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy.\n\nThe advertising and marketing industry is a vital component of the economy and it plays diverse roles in driving growth, nurturing innovation and creativity, and facilitating market efficiency. According to a report by Solomon Partners, the projections indicate that global advertising growth for 2024 is expected to range from 4.6% to 7.2%, nearly doubling the anticipated growth rate of 2% to 5% projected for 2023. Some of the major growth catalysts in the year for marketing and advertising companies are the Paris Olympics and the US elections. According to the report, the highest ad spending year-over-year growth is expected for out-of-home advertising at 7.2%, followed by digital ad spending at 6.3%. On the other hand, print ad spending is expected to decline by 4.6% year-over-year.\n\nAd Revenue on the Rise for Digital Advertising Companies\n\nIn recent weeks, companies with digital advertisement segments saw a healthy rise in their ad revenues. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat their estimates and experienced a significant rise in their advertisement businesses. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, on April 24, posting an EPS of $4.71, up $0.39 from forecasts. The company’s revenue was up 27% year-over-year at $36.46 billion, ahead of estimates by $240 million. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported that the number of ad impressions delivered across its Family of Apps increased by 20%, compared to the previous year and the average price per ad was up 6% year-over-year. Nearly 98% of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the following comments about integrating AI with its ad business:\n\n“...once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nSo if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted its earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.89, exceeding EPS estimates by $0.38. The company's revenue was up 15.4% year-over-year at $80.54 billion. The company’s Google advertising segment reported revenues of $61.66 billion, showing an increase of over 13% year-over-year. Furthermore, YouTube ads generated a revenue of $8.09 billion, compared to $6.693 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO, Sundar Pichai made the following comments at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.”\n\nWhile the above-mentioned companies generate most of their revenues from advertising and marketing, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce company. However, its ad revenue experienced the most noteworthy jump. On April 30, the company reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported an EPS of $1.13 and beat EPS expectations by $0.30. The company's revenue surged by 12.5% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and beat Wall Street consensus by $763.92 million. The company’s advertising business brought in a revenue of $11.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Here is what Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy said about its advertising business at the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we’re just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It’s very early for streaming TV ads but we’re encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It’s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start.”\n\nBarclays Identifies Microsoft's Ad Business Potential\n\nOn February 28, Barclays highlighted Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) strategic focus on advertising investments and emphasized their significance in light of ongoing antitrust actions in the US and Europe, as well as the evolving landscape influenced by artificial intelligence, as reported by TheFly. The firm believes that the company’s advertising assets could potentially reach a value of $50 billion over time and can challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the advertisement segment. Barclays estimates the intrinsic worth of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) advertising segment at $30 billion, largely propelled by platforms like LinkedIn and Bing, and anticipates a potential $20 billion surge in sales through aggressive distribution strategies. Barclays has a Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares with a $475 price target.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings on April 25, posting an EPS of $2.94 against $2.82 expectations. Its revenue of $61.9 billion was up over 17% year-over-year, and outperformed the estimates by $971.29 million. The company’s CEO, Satya Nadella made the following comments at its Q3 2024 earnings call:\n\n“We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest-rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines, and descriptions.”\n\nKeeping in mind the recent growth in advertising and marketing industry earnings across the board, some of the best marketing stocks to buy are Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:IAS), Nexxen International Ltd. (NASDAQ:NEXN), and Boston Omaha Corporation (NYSE:BOC). 12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\n12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 30 marketing and advertising agency stocks from SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:MRAD), Yahoo Finance stock screener, and some of our prior related articles. Next, we took each stock’s analyst sentiment from The Wall Street Journal and narrowed down our list to the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside, as of May 9.\n\nHedge fund sentiment around each stock has also been added. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Marketing Stocks to Buy\n\n12. Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.4%\n\nOmnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is a New York-based company that provides advertising, marketing, and corporate communications services. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 27 hedge funds had stakes in the stock with total positions worth $694.181 million. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the most dominant shareholder in the company with a stake worth $244.483 million.\n\nOn May 7, Barclays upgraded Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) to Overweight from Equal Weight and increased the price target to $110 from $100. The stock has Buy-equivalent ratings as per the 11 out of 15 Wall Street analysts that have covered it over the past three months. As of May 9, the average price target of $107.58 represents an upside of 12.4% to the stock’s current price.\n\nIntegral Ad Science Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:IAS), Nexxen International Ltd. (NASDAQ:NEXN), and Boston Omaha Corporation (NYSE:BOC) are some of the best marketing stocks to buy, along with Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC).\n\nArtisan Partners made the following comment about Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is a global advertising and marketing services holding company. Organic growth came in slightly lighter than expected, which caused the stock to sell off. Even after the pullback, the stock has returned 22% over the prior one year. The business, while cyclical due to its ties to ad spend, is a royalty on competition as clients around the world seek Omnicom’s expertise in creating, managing and tracking advertising campaigns. The business generates strong free cash flow, which has funded capital return in the form of share repurchases and dividends (3.8% current dividend yield), and is mostly a cost-plus business, which lessens the risk of margin pressure. Omnicom also has a flexible cost model allowing it to cut overhead during economic downturns to protect operating profit. While we cannot predict the economic cycle, Omnicom is a business that has delivered high returns on equity over a full business cycle and is currently selling at an attractive ~12X earnings.”\n\n11. Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 15\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.57%\n\nCriteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO) is a France-based company that offers marketing and monetization services, including contextual advertising, video advertising, and others. Over the past three months, 9 Wall Street analysts have given Buy-equivalent ratings to Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO).

        "content": "AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says\n\nThe recent earnings season has made it abundantly clear that the AI revolution is not just knocking on the door but has forcefully entered the tech world.\n\nThe impressive results from tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), AlphabetInc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) underscored this transition, according to Daniel Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush.\n\nThese companies have reported “eye-popping capital expenditure numbers,” initiating an “AI tidal wave” in software and cloud development driven by generative AI.\n\n“The next phase of AI spending is now on the doorstep for the likes of Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and many others,” Ives wrote.\n\nThe expert said companies were “laser-focused on deploying generative AI” across various sectors. Additionally, major players such as Meta and Apple were diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promised significant spending in the coming years.\n\nOther major players like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promises significant spending in the coming years.\n\nIves projected AI and related purchases will account for 8%-10% of IT budgets in 2024, a stark increase from less than 1% in 2023. This surge represented a “massive growth catalyst” in what he referred to as the “initial wave of AI software growth.”\n\nIndustry-Wide Impact and Consumer Trends\n\nIves highlighted Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft as leaders in this burgeoning field, with their influence paving the way for a trillion-dollar spending spree over the next decade.\n\nRecent consumer surveys conducted by Wedbush show “broadly positive” trends for Internet-related groups, with expectations of strong digital advertising growth in 2024.\n\n“Our findings strongly support our expectations for accelerating e-commerce and digital advertising growth in 2024,” Ives said, pointing to bullish indicators for Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft’s ‘iPhone Moment’\n\nDescribing the current phase as Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” Ives believed AI would significantly alter the cloud growth trajectory for the company in the coming years. “We see an acceleration of adoption for generative AI and Copilot activity,” he explained.\n\nThis trend is boosting Azure cloud deal flow for Microsoft, with AI use cases “exploding across the enterprise landscape.” Ives estimated that for every $100 spent on Azure cloud services, there was an additional $35-$40 of AI spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s Foray into AI\n\nLooking ahead, Ives was particularly excited about Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where he anticipates the unveiling of a comprehensive AI strategy.\n\n“We believe Apple is set to unveil its long-awaited AI strategy to its golden installed base and developer community at WWDC,” he said.\n\nThis includes a new iPad lineup and the iPhone 16, which are expected to set new standards in AI technology.\n\n“The AI strategy at Apple will consist of an AI App Store that will be the foundational starting point for developers and AI apps,” Ives said.\n\nRead Now: Utilities Notch 7th Straight Session Of Gains: ‘Potential Derivative Play To The AI Boom’\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Google is the king among search engines, but OpenAI is reportedly looking to launch an AI-powered search engine to rival the platform where \"google\" became a verb.\n\nThe announcement, first reported by Bloomberg, says OpenAI plans to announce its artificial intelligence-powered search product Monday, according to two sources familiar with the matter\n\nThe announcement could be timed a day before Tuesday's start of Google's annual I/O conference, where the tech giant is expected to unveil a slew of AI-related products. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, participates in \"Charting the Path Forward: The Future of Artificial Intelligence\" at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders' Week in San Francisco Nov. 16, 2023.\n\nGOOGLE CO-FOUNDER SAYS COMPANY ‘DEFINITELY MESSED UP’ ON GEMINI'S IMAGE GENERATION\n\nOpenAI's search product is an extension of its flagship ChatGPT product and enables ChatGPT to pull in direct information from the web and include citations, according to Bloomberg. ChatGPT is OpenAI's chatbot product that uses the company's cutting-edge AI models to generate human-like responses to text prompts.\n\nOpenAI has seen its share of ups and downs over the last year, including the odd dismissal of CEO Sam Altman by the board in November 2023 before his hiring by OpenAI investor Microsoft and his rehiring as OpenAI CEO five days after his dismissal. OpenAI reinstated Altman to the board in March this year.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, attends a press event to announce Google as the new official partner of the Women's National Team at Google Berlin May 25, 2023.\n\nMusicians, newspapers and performers have all sued OpenAI for what they say are copyright violations. Elon Musk also sued the company over its original premise, and Musk has reportedly upped the salaries of his engineers to keep them from being poached by OpenAI.\n\nELON MUSK SUING OPEN AI, SAM ALTMAN, FOR BREAKING NOT FOR PROFIT MISSION\n\nIndustry observers have long called ChatGPT an alternative for gathering online information, though it has struggled with providing accurate and real-time information from the web. OpenAI earlier gave it an integration with Microsoft's Bing for paid subscribers. Meanwhile, Google has announced generative AI features for its own namesake engine. In this photo illustration, the OpenAI logo is displayed on a mobile phone screen in Ankara, Turkey, Jan. 9, 2024.\n\nAt the time, OpenAI's ChatGPT product was called the fastest application to ever reach 100 million monthly active users after it launched in late 2022. However, worldwide traffic to ChatGPT's website has been on a roller coaster ride in the past year and is only now returning to its May 2023 peak, according to analytics firm Similarweb, and the AI company is under pressure to expand its user base.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:OpenAI to announce a search engine to rival Google: report\n\nView comments",

        "content": "From Hype To Reality, AI Reshapes Pharmaceutical Industry Across Drug Discovery To Marketing - Stocks To Watch\n\nPharmaceutical companies have been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for quite some time. Researchers have been using advanced AI models to understand disease mechanisms even before the recent surge in interest.\n\nWednesday, researchers at Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google DeepMind developed AlphaFold 3, a new artificial intelligence (AI) model.\n\nAlphaFold 3 can predict the structure and interactions of biological molecules. This includes proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules that could function as drugs.\n\nAccording to the latest McKinsey Global Institute report, AI technology could generate $60 billion—$110 billion annually in economic value for the pharmaceutical industry, as it can help speed up the process of identifying compounds, their development, and approval.\n\nThe report adds that generative AI’s impact on pharmaceuticals is expected to be profound as the foundational models are built on languages, images, omics, patient information, and other types of data that come together to explain and solve the disease process and effective treatment ways.\n\nIncreased drug discovery, approval, and marketing speed can help companies resolve the asset life cycle compression issue, which is the diminishing amount of time companies have to capture the value of the new drug.\n\nMcKinsey’s research shows that the time has decreased to 9.8 years from 11.7 years over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite the speedy discovery, the average cost of discovering and developing new drugs has increased.\n\nGenerative AI using augmented foundational models can help accelerate pharma research, with drug discovery timelines cut by almost half. AI tech can have a potential economic value of $15 billion-$28 billion on research and discovery.\n\nThe report notes that, on average, ten years and around $1.4 billion are needed to bring one new drug to the market, of which 80% is associated with clinical development.\n\nGenerative AI addresses pain points by increasing efficiency across the clinical development process, unlocking the economic value of $13 billion to $25 billion.\n\nGenerative AI tools can deepen relationships between care providers, pharmacists, insurers, and patients to fine-tune campaign strategies in real time, per the report.\n\nPharma professionals and patients will have substantial data to make faster, smarter decisions, providing a potential opportunity of $18 billion to $30 billion.\n\nIn 2023, the World Health Organization unveiled a comprehensive publication highlighting critical regulatory considerations for harnessing the potential of AI in healthcare.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn April, Bayer AG (OTC:BAYRY) and Google Cloud announced a collaboration to develop AI solutions to support radiologists.\n\nKey players shaping the market include industry giants such as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Google, General Electric Co (NYSE:GE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT), Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), Amazon Web Services, and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article From Hype To Reality, AI Reshapes Pharmaceutical Industry Across Drug Discovery To Marketing - Stocks To Watch originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Realtor.com CEO Damian Eales: CoStar is lying about being the No. 2 portal",
        "content": "Realtor.com Damien Eales\n\nThe so-called portal wars heated up this week, when Realtor.com CEO Damian Eales made comments about rival CoStar Group’sHomes.com during the MLS Forum at the National Association of Realtors’ annual legislative meeting.\n\nIn his remarks, Eales took issue with CoStar’s claims that Homes.com has surpassed Realtor.com as the second most-trafficked home search site, according to Inman, which first reported on Eales’ remarks.\n\nDuring his talk, Eales noted that Securities and Exchange Commission filings from CoStar Group show that “[its traffic] number includes 17 separate websites, 16 of which are not associated with Homes.com.”\n\nEales elaborated on this further in his prepared remarks during NewsCorp’s earnings call with investors on Wednesday.\n\n“If Zillow is the hungry Lion, then perhaps CoStar is the wolf in sheep’s clothing. A new competitor who plays by their own rules. We are calling out the falsehoods in their audience claims at the moment,” Eales said. “They advertise that they have an audience of 156 million for Homes.com, which is plain wrong.”\n\nLies, damned lies, and statistics\n\nIn an email, a Realtor.com spokesperson clarified that this was in reference to “ads across real estate news sites,” in which “CoStar is claiming an audience of 156M for Homes.com, some without readable footnotes and others with none at all, but that number is actually for their Residential Network traffic, which includes 17 URLS.”\n\nCoStar Group first announced that its Residential Network had exceeded 156 million monthly unique visitors and that the Homes.com site had surpassed 110 million monthly unique visitors, based on data from Google Analytics, in its Q1 2024 investor presentation.\n\nThe commercial real estate giant confirmed that its “Residential Network” does include the 17 sites referenced by Eales and Realtor.com. This network includes Homes.com, as well as Apartments.com, Homesnap and CitySnap. CoStar has only ever used the traffic figure specifically for Homes.com to claim that its residential listing portal is second in popularity.\n\nAccording to NewsCorp’s fiscal year 2024 third quarter earnings released on May 8, 2024, Realtor.com had 72 million average monthly unique users of the portal’s web and mobile sites based on Move’s internal data.\n\nIn an email, a Realtor.com spokesperson clarified that Move Inc., the parent company of Realtor.com, uses Adobe Analytics for its internal traffic tracking.\n\nIn his remarks this week, Eales also claimed that based on “independent sources,” “Homes.com is No. 4.”\n\nRealtor.com clarified that the independent source referenced by Eales is media tracking and evaluation solution ComScore.\n\nStory continues\n\nData from ComScore shows that in March 2024, Zillow had 112 million unique monthly users, Realtor.com has 54 million unique monthly users, Redfin recorded 41 million unique monthly users, and Homes.com had 39 million unique monthly users.\n\nFor all four sites, ComScore’s numbers are much lower than those reported by the firms’ via other analytics providers, which can be attributed to the fact that ComScore relies on a sample group and has stricter session recording criteria that excludes short visits and bot traffic, while others, such as Google Analytics, captures all visits by default. A spokesperson for CoStar clarified that the company does not include bot traffic or internal traffic in its Google Analytics numbers.\n\nIn the web analytics marketplace, Google Analytics has 70.84% market share, while Adobe Analytics, which is used by Realtor.com, has a 1.49% market share and ComScore has 0.31% market share, according to data from 6sense.\n\n“Move CEO Damian Eales’ comments about Homes.com web traffic at the MLS Forum of the Realtors Legislative Meetings were defamatory and frankly desperate. Earlier this year, Homes.com, the fastest growing portal in the U.S., launched the industry’s largest marketing campaign to drive hundreds of millions of visits back to Homes.com, where all agents benefit. The results are clear, Homes.com had more monthly unique visitors than Realtor.com, whether you look at our Homes.com Network or just Homes.com alone,” a CoStar spokesperson wrote in an email.\n\n“For March 2024, our Homes.com Network (which includes Homes.com, the Apartments Network and the Land Network), had 156 million monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, which is more than double, and Homes.com alone had 110 million monthly unique visitors, according to Google Analytics, which is substantially more, than what Move has self-reported based on its own ’internal data,’” the statement continued.\n\nIn September, Homes.com recorded over 100 million unique monthly visitors, a 1290% increase over the year prior, according data from Google Analytics. Since hitting that milestone the firm has kept up its aggressive — and expensive — advertising campaign. In February, CoStar aired four advertisements during the broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs. According the firm, it has spent roughly $1 billion on its advertising campaign.\n\nEarlier this year CoStar launched the monetization of Homes.com memberships. In Q1 2024, the sales team for Homes.com generated nearly $40 million in net new bookings.\n\n“This is by far the strongest sales launch of any product in the company’s history, and we are raising our sales and revenue forecast for Homes.com for the full year 2024,” Andy Florance, the CEO of CoStar Group, said during the firm’s Q1 earnings call with investors.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor.\n\nBut Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs.\n\nThat might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun.\n\nThe AI wars\n\nThe AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nAI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips.\n\nAll of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks.\n\nQualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively. Qualcomm on Wednesday announced its latest chips designed to run on Windows laptops, taking aim at Intel and Nvidia. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nYou can’t mention AI performance without talking about Nvidia, but it’s almost unfair to compare its chips to the competition. That’s because Nvidia’s graphics chips are dedicated to graphics processing and can be programmed to run AI apps. But because they’re not multipurpose chips like those from Apple, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, they’re far more capable. In fact, Nvidia claims its laptop chips offer 20x to 60x the performance of competing neural processing units.\n\nThe point is, there’s a new stat for these tech companies to battle over, and you can be sure they’ll do just that. The fact that Apple had already come out swinging with its own measurement is proof enough of that.\n\nTOPS and you\n\nWhat does that mean for the average consumer? Not all that much just yet. Generative AI apps running on PCs and Macs and iPads are still few and far between. So far, there are programs that help you manipulate photos and videos or track your eye movement in video chat apps.\n\nBut there’s still no killer app that would get me to go running out the door to pick up an AI PC. That could all change in the coming weeks, though. That’s because Microsoft and Apple are set to kick off their annual developers conferences, where they’re expected to debut a slew of AI apps and services, and at least some of those should run on their respective devices.\n\nHow much they manage to entice consumers to pony up for AI PCs and the like, however, will depend on whether they’re truly useful or not.

        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Home Depot Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings\n\nHome Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is expected to release earnings results for its first quarter, before the opening bell on May 14.\n\nAnalysts expect the Atlanta, Georgia-based company to report quarterly earnings at $3.60 per share. That’s up from $3.40 per share in the year-ago period. Home Depot is projected to post quarterly revenue of $36.67 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nOn April 11, Home Depot said it will continue its relationship with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Cloud. The two companies have collaborated closely since 2015 on retail technology, both in-store and online.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Home Depot, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Home Depot has a dividend yield of 2.59%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $2.25 a share ($9.00 a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Home Depot, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Home Depot's $9.00 dividend: $6,000 / $9.00  = 667 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $231,742 worth of Home Depot, or 667 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $9.00 = 133 shares, or $46,210 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nAlso Read: Over $34M Bet On This Industrial Stock? Check Out These 4 Stocks Insiders Are Buying\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nHD Price Action: Shares of Home Depot rose 2.5% to close at $347.44 on Thursday.\n\nRead More: Jim Cramer Says Buy This Tech Stock Right Here, Likes Cognex\n\nStory continues\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nHOME DEPOT (HD): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Home Depot Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World.\n\n\"NVIDIA Has to Keep Working\"\n\nOn May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment.\n\nThe interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index. Kaiser highlights the magnificent seven including,\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA),  held 70% of the market cap last year, however, now they position in the 40% to 50% range, with names like Meta and Tesla not performing as well. He also suggested that the best-case scenario would be NVIDIA missing due to high demand and low supply, indicating that the market is still in high demand. He closed the interview by highlighting that if the industry is to keep progressing, NVIDIA is to keep working harder.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +6.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.84 per share, indicating a change of +27.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.57 points to a change of +30.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.8%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.63 indicates a change of +14% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOGL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $295.12 billion and $329.03 billion estimates indicate +15.1% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "UPDATE 2-OpenAI plans to announce Google search competitor on Monday, sources say",
        "content": "(Updates May 9 story with company and CEO posts on X about upcoming event)\n\nBy Anna Tong\n\nMay 9 (Reuters) - OpenAI plans to announce its artificial intelligence-powered search product on Monday, according to two sources familiar with the matter, raising the stakes in its competition with search king Google.\n\nThe announcement date, though subject to change, has not been previously reported. Bloomberg and the Information have reported that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is working on a search product to potentially compete with Alphabet's Google and with Perplexity, a well-funded AI search startup.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment before Reuters published its report on Thursday.\n\nAfter publication, OpenAI on Friday posted on X that the company would stream a live event on Monday, to \"demo some ChatGPT and GPT-4 updates.\"\n\nCEO Sam Altman later posted on X, \"not gpt-5, not a search engine, but we’ve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! feels like magic to me.\"\n\nAlphabet's stock partly recovered from an over 2% loss following Altman's post, and was last down 0.9%.\n\nOpenAI's announcements could be timed a day before the Tuesday start of Google's annual I/O conference, where the tech giant is expected to unveil a slew of AI-related products.\n\nOpenAI's search product is an extension of its flagship ChatGPT product, and enables ChatGPT to pull in direct information from the Web and include citations, according to Bloomberg. ChatGPT is OpenAI's chatbot product that uses the company's cutting-edge AI models to generate human-like responses to text prompts.\n\nIndustry observers have long called ChatGPT an alternative for gathering online information, though it has struggled with providing accurate and real-time information from the Web. OpenAI earlier gave it an integration with Microsoft's Bing for paid subscribers. Meanwhile, Google has announced generative AI features for its own namesake engine.\n\nStartup Perplexity, which has a valuation of $1 billion, was founded by a former OpenAI researcher, and has gained traction through providing an AI-native search interface that shows citations in results and images as well as text in its responses. It has 10 million monthly active users, according to a January blog post from the startup.\n\nAt the time, OpenAI's ChatGPT product was called the fastest application to ever reach 100 million monthly active users after it launched in late 2022. However, worldwide traffic to ChatGPT's website has been on a roller-coaster ride in the past year and is only now returning to its May 2023 peak, according to analytics firm Similarweb, and the AI company is under pressure to expand its user base.\n\nAn earlier attempt to bring updated and real-world information in to ChatGPT, called ChatGPT plugins, was retired in April, according to a help center posting on OpenAI's website.

        "title": "The Smartest Dividend Stocks to Buy With Under $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Big technology companies have always been known for generating price appreciation for investors, but the tide is slowly changing. Personal electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has paid dividends since 2012. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) recently joined the dividend ranks.\n\nMany dividend investors look for cash flow first and foremost. Did you know these three companies have combined for an astounding $220 billion in cash flow over the past year alone? No group of businesses has generated as much cash flow in humanity's history as these technology giants.\n\nNow, they've turned on the spigot, funneling some of those profits to shareholder profits.\n\nHere's the pitch for why each company is among the smartest dividend stocks you can buy for under $1,000.\n\n1. Apple is still among the world's best businesses\n\nThings haven't been perfect for Apple in recent years. The company's growth has stagnated, a sign that Apple has gotten so big that its flagship iPhone product can no longer move the needle. But don't get it mixed up; Apple is still a behemoth that earns more in cash flow than all but a few companies worldwide do in sales. It's still Warren Buffett's top holding, even if the Oracle of Omaha sold some of his stock via Berkshire Hathaway. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nLong-term investors should focus on some very important facts. First, Apple can return more cash to shareholders than any company. It recently unveiled the largest share repurchase program in U.S. history, a $110 billion buyback that will dent the company's share count (and boost earnings per share). Additionally, the dividend has a multidecade runway for growth. The dividend payout ratio is just 15% of cash flow. Apple has all the makings of a future Dividend King, especially as those massive buybacks show how quickly the payout ratio rises as the dividend grows.\n\nMost importantly, Apple is one big product away from newfound growth. More than two billion people have active iOS devices worldwide, and there are growing middle classes worldwide, including in India, where the company is shifting parts of its production. That's a massive distribution network for new products. Plus, Apple still hasn't swung hard at artificial intelligence (AI), so watch out. Apple's best growth is probably behind it, but earnings per share could still have plenty of juice to squeeze.\n\n2. Alphabet is the newest member of the big-tech dividend club\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, recently unveiled its first dividend during its first-quarter earnings. The quarterly payout will add up to $0.80 annually for a starting 0.5% yield. That's obviously not much, but Alphabet is one of the largest cash cows on Earth. Rest assured, that dividend will grow over the decades to come. Think of buying shares today as getting in on the dividend \"ground floor.\" It's only going up from here. If that wasn't enough, Alphabet casually tacked another $70 billion to its ongoing share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet makes most of its money by advertising on Google and YouTube, and while advertising can be sensitive to the economy, Alphabet hasn't suffered a dramatic downturn in its business: GOOGL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nGoogle and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide by a wide margin. Alphabet's advertising revenue is still growing at a double-digit rate, which signals significant cash flow growth still ahead. That should be music to long-term investors' ears. The dividend starts from a minuscule size, just 15% of annual cash flow, so look for a ton of growth over the coming years. Now is a great time to buy and watch your passive income grow.\n\n3. Meta has the makings of a dividend powerhouse\n\nWall Street can be short-sighted. Perhaps that's why Meta's stock has retreated from its highs after CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it clear in Q1 earnings that the company will continue investing heavily in artificial intelligence. But this is an opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up this future dividend superstar at a lower price. Meta's lucrative advertising business involves selling ads on its social media apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and (eventually) Threads.\n\nRemarkably, Meta is converting 35% of its revenue to free cash flow despite spending tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures. Cut those in half, and Meta would convert a staggering 44% of sales to cash. Keep that in mind for the future when capital expenditures eventually recede. META Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nMeta is also growing swiftly; revenue grew 27% year over year in Q1. The company potentially has years of double-digit growth ahead and decades of double-digit dividend increases. Don't let the stock's meager 0.1% yield turn you away. The payout ratio is only about 10% of free cash flow and even less of operating cash flow. Meta is a true compounder -- a business that is growing earnings and the cash it returns to shareholders at a double-digit rate, a gem long-term investors should buy and hold indefinitely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Will Its Colossal Gains Continue or Reverse?",
        "content": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has grown remarkably, soaring approximately 490% in under two years. However, Meta recently saw its most significant market cap decline since 2022, shedding around $200 billion following its Q1 results. The stock received downward revisions in target prices across Wall Street. The crucial question now is whether to buy or sell. Personally, I view this as an opportunity to invest in the stock based on its AI-based growth trajectory. I believe it can keep rising.\n\nWeak Revenue Outlook, Higher AI Spend Disappoint Despite Q1 EPS Beat\n\nMeta’s Q1 adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $4.32 per share. Also, earnings more than doubled year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.20 per share in the prior-year period. Revenues jumped 27% year-over-year to $36.5 billion, meeting consensus estimates by $36.2 billion.\n\nThe revenue jump was fueled by a 27% rise in Advertising revenue (accounts for 98% of total revenues) to $35.64 billion. However, the Reality Labs division (the division that invests in the Metaverse) continued to report losses, amounting to $3.85 billion for the quarter.\n\nDespite the EPS beat, the stock experienced its largest single-day decline (15%) in over two years. This decline can be attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance and higher-than-expected capital expenditures (CAPEX) forecasts.\n\nThe Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent expects Q2 total revenue to range between $36.5-39 billion, while the consensus was pegged at $38.3 million. CAPEX is expected to increase to $35-40 billion versus the prior guided range of $30-37 billion. Further, expenses are expected to increase and are forecasted to continue to increase through next year. For FY2024, total expenses are predicted to range around $96-99 billion versus the prior guided range of $94-99 billion.\n\nMeta Plans to Invest Heavily in Creating Massive AI Infrastructure\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg elaborated on Meta’s heightened investment plans in AI infrastructure. The company aims to inject billions into the AI space and develop its proprietary AI chips, thereby reducing dependence on chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIn terms of newer products, the company also announced that MetaAI, featuring Llama 3 (competing with Microsoft’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini), is poised to become the most efficient AI assistant. This innovation could represent a substantial business opportunity in the coming years, further contributing to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta’s AI investment plans align somewhat with its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the AI domain. While Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported CAPEX of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent $14 billion. Both Google and MSFT plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nHowever, Google and Meta’s shares soared after their recent earnings. On the contrary, Meta’s shares plunged as their capital investments are still not visible in their revenue and earnings growth. For instance, Google and Microsoft’s capital investments in AI are yielding impressive growth in their cloud businesses. However, Meta’s Reality Labs business segment still remains unprofitable, with reported losses exceeding $45 billion since the end of FY2020.\n\nIn essence, while AI spending is translating into direct gains for Google and Microsoft, it’s taking Meta longer to show such returns, turning it into a capital-intensive, cash-sucking endeavor. Therefore, the following question arises: should investors wait and observe or buy the stock at current levels following the recent decline?\n\nIn the long run, Meta’s move to produce its own chips will likely benefit the company significantly by reducing costs associated with expensive GPUs procured from NVDA currently. Additionally, owning its AI infrastructure promises faster and more efficient processing of vast amounts of data for the social media giant.\n\nMeta Stock Is Attractively Valued and Backed by Stable Free Cash Flows\n\nIn terms of its valuation, Meta is attractively valued. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 23.5x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. For the sake of comparison, Microsoft is trading at a P/E of 35x, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at over 50x.\n\nDespite elevated capital expenditures, Meta’s free cash flows remain healthy at $49.5 billion for the past 12 months, or 4.1% of the current market capitalization. It is worth noting that the company started a dividend for the first time in the preceding quarter and continued to buy back shares, implying that management is confident in the company’s fundamentals.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about the stock. Overall, META commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. Meta Platforms stock’s average price target of $530.93 implies 11.73% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Current Stock Price Weakness as a Buying Opportunity\n\nSocial media giant Meta has built a vast user base over time, establishing itself as the clear industry leader. Its steady position among the world’s “Magnificent 7” mega-cap stocks is well-deserved, supported by the continued growth in advertising revenue per user. Notably, Meta’s revenues and margins have been growing impressively, and the integration of AI infrastructure across its portfolio is poised to drive revenues even higher in the coming years.\n\nFor those who missed out on Meta’s remarkable stock rally (second only to NVDA) over the last two years, the current dip presents a buying opportunity, in my view. I personally plan to buy the stock and hold it for the long term.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Widens distribution. No change to text.)\n\nBy Anna Tong\n\nMay 9 (Reuters) - OpenAI plans to announce its artificial intelligence-powered search product on Monday, according to two sources familiar with the matter, raising the stakes in its competition with search king Google.\n\nThe announcement date, though subject to change, has not been previously reported. Bloomberg and the Information have reported that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is working on a search product to potentially compete with Alphabet's Google and with Perplexity, a well-funded AI search startup.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment.\n\nThe announcement could be timed a day before the Tuesday start of Google's annual I/O conference, where the tech giant is expected to unveil a slew of AI-related products.\n\nOpenAI's search product is an extension of its flagship ChatGPT product, and enables ChatGPT to pull in direct information from the Web and include citations, according to Bloomberg. ChatGPT is OpenAI's chatbot product that uses the company's cutting-edge AI models to generate human-like responses to text prompts.\n\nIndustry observers have long called ChatGPT an alternative for gathering online information, though it has struggled with providing accurate and real-time information from the Web. OpenAI earlier gave it an integration with Microsoft's Bing for paid subscribers. Meanwhile, Google has announced generative AI features for its own namesake engine.\n\nStartup Perplexity, which has a valuation of $1 billion, was founded by a former OpenAI researcher, and has gained traction through providing an AI-native search interface that shows citations in results and images as well as text in its responses. It has 10 million monthly active users, according to a January blog post from the startup.\n\nAt the time, OpenAI's ChatGPT product was called the fastest application to ever reach 100 million monthly active users after it launched in late 2022. However, worldwide traffic to ChatGPT's website has been on a roller-coaster ride in the past year and is only now returning to its May 2023 peak, according to analytics firm Similarweb, and the AI company is under pressure to expand its user base.\n\nAn earlier attempt to bring updated and real-world information in to ChatGPT, called ChatGPT plugins, was retired in April, according to a help center posting on OpenAI's website.

        "title": "Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&amp;T-Style Breakup Next?",
        "content": "Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week.\n\nNow, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space.\n\nMehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year.\n\nThe case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space.\n\nSpecifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space.\n\nLast week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox.\n\nGoogle is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy.\n\nThe final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023.\n\nRead also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake?\n\nThe case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department. The central argument of the lawsuit is that Google’s control of today’s internet is extensive enough to be considered a monopoly, and that it violated antitrust laws by paying competitor firms, cell phone manufacturers, and wireless internet providers to maintain its position as the default search engine.\n\nThe company then benefitted from the extra traffic via its ad business.\n\nFor its part, Google has argued that its market dominance is merely a result of the superior quality of its products in a fair competition game. While the company has admitted to paying partners and competitors to give its search engine a prime position, it has argued (both in an open letter from September 2023 and in the trial) that web browser developers choose to showcase Google by their own will.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has also argued that competitors like Yahoo or Bing also pay browser developers to receive a preferential position in their software and that it's very easy for users to change the default search engine on any device.\n\nThe importance of the trial is hard to overstate. This case marks the first time the Federal Government has brought a big technology company to court on antitrust charges in over two decades, since a U.S. judge ruled that Microsoft had violated the nation’s antitrust laws in 2000, in a lawsuit initiated by the Justice Department and 19 states in 1998.\n\nThe consequences of the decision could also ripple across several other antitrust lawsuits currently shaking up Big Tech companies, including an ongoing antitrust probe by the Federal Trade Commission into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as well as a probe by the same agency into Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), parent company of Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram.\n\nGoogle is also under fire in Europe, where the EU’s Court of Justice is fining it $2.6 billion over antitrust penalties.\n\nWhat's At Stake For Google?\n\nIn a press release, the Justice Department has compared this lawsuit with other landmark antitrust actions including Microsoft in 1998 and AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 1974 trial which eventually broke the Bell system into several companies nationwide in 1982.\n\nBy the end of last week's arguments, Mehta said he has not arrived at a decision yet. According to CNN, the judge proposed that in order to be able to compete with Google's dominant position, a hypothetical competitor would need to invest billions, not just in developing the complex search tool itself, but also in competing with Google on its billion-dollar exclusivity contracts with web browser developers and device manufacturers.\n\n\"I can't conceive of a world in which some other competitor, particularly a new competitor, could do that. Microsoft couldn't do it,\" Mehta said.\n\nIf Mehta rules in favor of the Justice Department, the trial would move to a second stage, wherein the court would determine which penalties Google should face. In these separate proceedings, plaintiffs and the company would present different ways in which Google should respond in order to relinquish some of its alleged monopolistic power.\n\nPossible avenues would be to break up the company into several units, including a separate one for the Android operating system, which is currently owned by Google, according to Bloomberg. Another possible penalty would be forcing Google to disclose its search data to competitors in order to level the playing field, or forcing the company to give up its exclusivity agreements with other companies.\n\nBill Baer, a former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division told the New York Times that it's unlikely that DOJ. will seek some sort of breakup for the company.\n\n\"It's more likely there will be some sort of restrictions on Google's behavior going forward,\" he said.\n\nNow read: Has Chrome Been Tracking You During ‘Incognito’ Mode?

        "title": "30 Most In-Demand Jobs in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 30 most in-demand jobs in the US. We have also discussed the growing unemployment claims in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Most In-Demand Jobs in the US.\n\nIn the latest data release, weekly jobless claims in the US increased by 22,000 to reach 231,000 which is the highest level seen in over eight months. This uptick suggests a gradual cooling of the labor market, following reports of sluggish job growth in April and a decline in job openings to a three-year low in March. This trend has prompted discussions about potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, with two cuts this year now back on the table.\n\nThe rise in jobless claims has been attributed to the end of school spring breaks which has complicated the process of seasonal adjustment in the data. Moreover, unadjusted claims increased by 19,690, with major spikes observed in states like New York, California, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. To read more about joblessness, see 15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.\n\nIn line with the claims of joblessness, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has dramatically reduced its job postings in North America by slashing over 3,400 positions down to just three. This drastic cut has come in the wake of a challenging first quarter. The reduced job listings have primarily affected roles in California, Texas, and Nevada, where Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the most important operations. The decision hints at a strategic reassessment of the company's hiring needs and operational focus.\n\nBeyond North America, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also intensifying job cuts in China. However, The impact on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA’s Chinese operations remains uncertain, with the company yet to comment on the scale of the cuts.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has announced layoffs affecting at least 200 employees from its \"Core\" team based in California. These positions are being shifted overseas to offices in India and Mexico. The Core Systems & Experience division is responsible for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s flagship products and global IT infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also announced major layoffs within its global recruitment team. While Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)  assures that the layoffs are not part of a large-scale reduction and that the majority of the team will be retained for hiring essential positions, it's still an important development in the tech employment landscape. Reports indicate that Alphabet had already made substantial job cuts earlier in the year, slashing about 12,000 positions in January which constituted a 6% reduction in its workforce.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese persistent layoffs also explain why 15% of US workers currently harbor feelings of job insecurity, despite unemployment rates hitting record lows. This phenomenon isn't accidental; it's a deliberate strategy in many workplaces aimed at motivating employees and cutting costs. Companies like Meta Platforms Inc and General Electric Co have openly admitted to leveraging the fear of job loss to spur performance, despite ample evidence of its detrimental effects on employees' well-being. While this tactic may suppress demands for raises and benefits, it comes at the cost of workers' social connections, identity, and overall health.\n\nResearch indicates that job insecurity breeds a toxic work environment that comes with stress, resentment, and exhaustion. While 15% may indeed strive to enhance their performance and comply rigorously with company policies, the cognitive load imposed by insecurity undermines these efforts. 30 Most In-Demand Jobs in the US\n\nA medical professional in scrubs typing on an electronic medical record, depicting the value of the company's medical services.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the most in-demand jobs in the US, we relied on data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on projected change in employment from 2022 to 2032.

        "title": "Reddit is maturing as a company, CEO says",
        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) is entering its adult years, and that may turn out well for investors.\n\n\"A lot of things are really starting to click,\" Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told Yahoo Finance on Thursday (video above).\n\nThe company this week reported its first results since going public in late March — and there was much to prove the bears wrong.\n\nDaily active users increased 37% year over year to 82.7 million. Weekly active unique users rose 40% from the prior year.\n\nTotal revenue improved 48% to $243 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the prior quarter, due to strength in advertising. The company delivered adjusted operating profits of $10 million, versus a $50.2 million loss a year ago. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after ringing a bell on the floor in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nHuffman declined to say when the company would be profitable on a net income basis, noting it's a focus for the management team. Other areas of focus include rolling out a new user interface this year, introducing shopping capabilities, and searching for another artificial intelligence content licensing deal like the one with Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\n\"Results this quarter show that Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black said in a client note.\n\nFor Reddit, the quarter was another win for 2024.\n\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 in late March, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation. The targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\n\nThe stock began trading at $47 per share and quickly shot past $53.\n\nShares finished their first day of trading on March 21 at $50.44.\n\nThe stock currently trades at around $50 and received a double-digit percentage boost after earnings this week. Reddit's market cap is now roughly $8.1 billion.\n\nThe company was the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\n\nDespite being in business for almost 20 years, Reddit had never turned a profit before the first quarter. Last year the company saw sales rise 21% year over year to $804 million. The net loss clocked in at $90.8 million.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is also full steam ahead on AI, just like Reddit. In the latest episode of the Opening Bid podcast, Amazon's AWS CEO Adam Selipsky took investors inside the tech giant's AI plans.

        "title": "Reddit Lays Out Content Policy While Seeking More Licensing Deals",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Reddit Inc. released new policies governing data posted on its social network, including a ban on sending advertisements to users without consent, as it seeks to increase revenue through licensing agreements with artificial intelligence developers and other companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track ‘Seriously Underwater’ Home Mortgages Tick Up Across the US Arm Slides as Tepid Outlook Fuels Concerns Over AI Slowdown\n\nThe site’s content policy prevents data licensees from using Reddit posts or comments that have been deleted, making that content available to law enforcement agencies or using posts in a way that violates intellectual property rights, among other restrictions.\n\nChief Legal Officer Ben Lee said it was important to set out the guidelines, in part, because there was a perception that companies licensing Reddit’s data could do anything they wanted with the material.\n\nThe social media company has a licensing agreement with Alphabet Inc.’s Google worth $60 million to help train large language models, the technology underpinning generative AI, and is in talks with other AI companies.\n\n“They can’t try to reverse-engineer our user’s identity,” co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Steve Huffman said, referring to companies that pay to use Reddit data. “You can’t use it target ads. You can’t build a Reddit competitor, for example.”\n\nHuffman, speaking at a press briefing, also said Reddit would not share any private data, such as private messages, email addresses or phone numbers with data licensees, including AI companies. The company said it had more than 82.7 million global daily users in the first quarter — a 37% jump from a year earlier.\n\nStill, Reddit reminded users that it’s “inherently” a public platform. “Most of Reddit’s platform is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account,” the company said in its content policy.\n\nRead More: Reddit Shines in First Earnings Report, Sending Stock Soaring\n\nHuffman said Google has been a good partner, but that other companies have “taken advantage of” Reddit by scraping the site’s data without authorization to train AI models or using the platform’s content without sending any users back to the site.\n\n“We’re not against using Reddit data to train AIs,” said Huffman. “We just want to do so on clear terms so that everybody knows what’s going on.”\n\nEarlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission began investigating Reddit’s plans to license its user-generated content. Huffman said the conversations are in the early stages and declined to share more. The company previously said in a filing that it didn’t believe it had engaged in unfair or deceptive practices.\n\nStory continues\n\nReddit’s AI licensing business is small but growing. Huffman declined to discuss the specifics of the Google deal but said typical terms can range from how long of a Reddit summary can show up in a Google search to whether a licensee has to display Reddit branding in AI-generated results.\n\nReddit has signed licensing agreements worth $203 million in total, with terms ranging from two to three years. The company generated about $20 million from AI content deals last quarter, and expects to bring in more than $60 million by the end of the year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic said its decision to partner with both Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc. ensures it can maintain more “independence” than if it were reliant on one large tech firm, as is the case with rival OpenAI.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n‘Seriously Underwater’ Home Mortgages Tick Up Across the US Microsoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Marjorie Taylor Greene Finally Got What She Deserved: Defeat\n\n“That independence and that choice is one thing that I think differentiates Anthropic from some of these other deals,” Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview Thursday at the Bloomberg Technology Summit.\n\nGoogle, Amazon and Microsoft Corp. have invested billions in leading AI startups, providing vital financing and cloud computing support to build their computationally intensive products. But regulators in the US and UK are scrutinizing these deals to gauge their impact on the competitive landscape for AI.\n\nMicrosoft, in particular, has committed to invest $13 billion in OpenAI. The tech giant has also integrated the AI startup’s technology into virtually every corner of its business and played a key role in negotiating for Sam Altman to return as CEO of OpenAI after he was ousted by the board.\n\nAnthropic, by comparison, is not as closely tied to one large investor. Google and Amazon have agreed to pump $2 billion and $4 billion into the startup, respectively. The companies also provide Anthropic with chips and cloud infrastructure to support building its AI systems.\n\nAnthropic’s financial needs may only grow in the coming years. Amodei said it currently costs about $100 million to train models, but he expects this will eventually reach $100 billion.\n\n“I expect we’ll see similarly structured deals,” Daniela Amodei, Anthropic’s co-founder and president, said at the event.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

(NYSE:HUBS), Bloomberg reports.\n\nWhile discussions continue, no definitive agreement has been reached. The possibility of another interested buyer entering the scene remains, indicating a level of uncertainty surrounding the potential acquisition,\n\nBoth Alphabet and HubSpot have refrained from commenting on the matter, Bloomberg said.\n\nHubSpot’s shares surged by approximately 32% over the past year, elevating its market capitalization to $30 billion.\n\nThe stock witnessed a notable uptick, climbing up to 6% during premarket trading on Thursday.\n\nHubSpot aims to deliver seamless connection for customer-facing teams on its platform, which includes AI-powered engagement hubs, a Smart CRM, and a connected ecosystem with over 1,500 App Marketplace integrations.\n\nThe company reported a first-quarter FY24 revenue of $617.4 million, a 23% increase compared to first-quarter FY23. Subscription revenue which makes up a large part, gained 23% to $603.8 million.\n\nThe company anticipates full-year 2024 revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.56 billion. As of Mar. 31, HubSpot had $447.79 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nAn acquisition of HubSpot by Alphabet would represent a significant move, potentially positioning Alphabet to enhance its competitiveness in the customer relationship management (CRM) sector, particularly targeting smaller businesses.\n\nThis move could help Alphabet better compete with major CRM players like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis prospect underscores Alphabet’s strategic intent to enhance its market presence and diversify its service offerings.\n\nAlphabet stock has gained more than 57% in the last 12 months.

Redditor Physioweng’s query sparked a thoughtful discussion, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerging as a popular choice for its robust fundamentals and strategic positioning.\n\nWhich Magnificent 7 is the healthiest?\r\n byu/Physioweng instocks\n\nMicrosoft Vs. Google – The Battle For AI Dominance\n\nCommentators highlighted Microsoft’s exceptional leadership and its dominance in AI talent as key indicators of strength. Despite criticisms about its AI capabilities, particularly compared to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), known as Google, Microsoft’s strategic application of AI has been a standout feature. Its multifaceted approach, spanning cloud computing, software development, gaming, hardware design, search, advertising, and acquisitions like GitHub and LinkedIn, underscores its status as a diversified powerhouse. “It’s more like a mini etf itself,” commented Redditor St3w1e0.\n\nComment\r\n byu/Physioweng from discussion\r\n instocks\n\nThe debate over AI leadership between Microsoft and Google sparked further analysis. While Google is recognized for its innovative prowess, commentators noted Microsoft’s practical application and superior execution in AI.\n\nMicrosoft’s ability to find real-world applications for AI technologies has given it an edge, contrasting with Google’s struggles to maintain product continuity.\n\nAlso Read: Google’s DeepMind Co-Founder Mustafa Suleyman, Shares His Exciting First Month At Microsoft: ‘Truly Transformational’\n\nMicrosoft Vs.

Amazon – Cloud Computing\n\nAlongside Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) emerged as a top contender, particularly lauded for its dominance in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Despite Azure’s market share gains, AWS’s sheer size and market penetration set it apart, likened to a heavyweight compared to Azure’s featherweight stature in the cloud services arena.\n\nStory continues\n\nComment\r\n byu/Physioweng from discussion\r\n instocks\n\nAs the tech hype cycle ebbs and flows, Microsoft and Amazon stand out as stalwarts of innovation and market resilience.\n\nMicrosoft’s strategic diversification and leadership under Nadella, coupled with Amazon’s formidable presence in cloud computing, underscore their status as pillars of stability in an ever-evolving tech landscape.

        "title": "Hong Kong Puts Google in Hot Seat With Ban on Protest Song",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong called it “unbelievable” when Google rebuffed its 2022 request to bury a popular protest song from search results. Now armed with an injunction, authorities are putting legal pressure on the tech firm to wipe it from the city’s internet.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump’s Demeanor Arm Slides as Tepid Outlook Fuels Concerns Over AI Slowdown\n\nThe Court of Appeal on Wednesday approved the government’s application for an injunction order to prevent anyone from playing Glory to Hong Kong with seditious intent. While the city has a new security law to punish that crime, the judgment shifted responsibility onto the platforms, adding a new danger that just hosting the track could expose companies to legal risks.\n\nIn granting the injunction, judges said prosecuting individual offenders wasn’t enough to tackle the “acute criminal problems.”\n\n“The injunction was necessary to persuade the IPOs to remove the problematic videos in connection with the song from their platforms,” they wrote, referring to internet platform operators.\n\nThe injunction “places Google, media platforms and other social media companies in a difficult position: Essentially pitting values such as free speech in direct conflict with legal obligations,” said Ryan Neelam, program director at the Lowy Institute and former Australian diplomat to Hong Kong and Macau. “It will further the broader chilling effect if foreign tech majors do comply.”\n\nGoogle’s decision will amount to a landmark test case for the city’s internet freedoms. Any removals would set a precedent and fan fears that China’s sweeping censorship controls are creeping into Hong Kong. Unlike mainland China, the former British colony doesn’t block foreign social media platforms or search engines.\n\nA representative for Google declined a request for comment. The Hong Kong government didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf the Silicon Valley giant doesn’t comply it could face penalties including a fine and more criticism from the government. The American internet giant has 500 to 600 employees in Hong Kong, Bloomberg previously reported, with the bulk of the operations focused on selling ads and marketing. If the company were to pull out, it would need to reorganize its business operations in Asia, which may include moving some employees to other countries.\n\nThe loss of Google could set back the city’s renewed efforts to bolster its image as a global business hub, after years of Covid curbs and a Beijing-imposed security law dented sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US government and human rights groups sounded alarm over the judgment’s impact on the city’s reputation as a finance hub. The free flow of information remains critical to Hong Kong’s appeal to global businesses, a strength lauded by Chief Executive John Lee at a summit this week aimed at attracting global talent.\n\nThe judgment included 32 links to the song on Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube and referenced content on search engines such as Google, Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. The majority of the YouTube videos cited were still accessible from Hong Kong on Thursday.\n\nThe Asia Internet Coalition — an industry association that counts Google, Yahoo, Apple Inc, Spotify Technology S.A, and Meta Platforms Inc as members — said it was assessing how the court decision will be implemented to determine its business impact.\n\nSecretary for Justice Paul Lam said he expected internet companies to comply and that it wouldn’t restrict their normal operations. “The effect is to persuade internet service providers not to provide convenience and not to facilitate the permission of unlawful act,” he said. “I think this point is very clear.”\n\nLocal officials have rebuked Google for years for not preventing Glory to Hong Kong appearing in searches for the city’s national anthem after it was released during anti-government protests in 2019. The song was erroneously played instead of the Chinese national anthem at several international sporting events.\n\nAfter Google rebuffed that request, security chief Chris Tang in 2022 vowed to use “all means” to correct the situation. Government prosecutors filed an injunction order that also applied to anyone who knowingly allowed others to play the song to incite secession, specifying the 32 YouTube videos for removal.\n\nThe latest ruling overturned a previous court decision rejecting the government’s bid, which cited a potential chilling effect and lack of utility because existing laws already have a deterrent effect.\n\nGoogle and other internet firms have said that they abide by local laws and regulations wherever they operate. That includes taking down content in countries like Thailand and India that have strict content regulations.\n\nSince 2011, Hong Kong authorities have made 325 content removal requests, nearly 60% of which were made in 2023, the company disclosed. In March last year, Google said it didn’t comply with requests from Hong Kong police to remove two YouTube links related to Glory to Hong Kong.\n\nHuman rights group Article 19 called the injunction an example of the city’s “embrace of digital repression” and called on global tech companies to resist the ban. “Considering most of these companies are US-based, Congress should call for testimony from their executives about such red lines,” said Michael Caster, Asia digital program manager for the organization.\n\nPopular versions of the Glory to Hong Kong tracks temporarily disappeared from Apple and Spotify platforms in June last year. The song’s composer, “ThomasDGX & HongKongers,” later said in a statement that the removed tracks were re-listed on major media sites after “technical issues unrelated to the streaming platforms.” The composer didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment on the latest injunction.\n\nRepresentatives from Apple and Spotify did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Meta referred Bloomberg to the Asia Internet Coalition statement.\n\nThe injunction raises the impetus for American tech giants to comply, and it could compromise the global reputation of such firms, said Dongshu Liu, an assistant professor specializing in Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\n“They now have a legal order in Hong Kong to follow,” he added. “Doing so may lead to pressure from the US or other Western markets accusing them of compromising on human rights.”\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "TikTok to label AI-generated images, video from OpenAI and elsewhere",
        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\nMay 9 (Reuters) - TikTok said on Thursday it would start using a technology aimed at helping it label images and video generated by artificial intelligence and uploaded to the video sharing service.\n\nTikTok said it would adopt \"Content Credentials,\" a digital watermark that denotes how images were created and edited. The Content Credential technology was spearheaded by Adobe but is open for other companies to use and already has been adopted by companies such as ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nResearchers have expressed concerned that AI-generated content could be used as misinformation in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections this fall. TikTok was already among a group of 20 tech companies that earlier this year signed an accord pledging to fight it.\n\nYouTube, owned by Alphabet's Google, as well as Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram and Facebook, have also said they plan to use Content Credentials.\n\nFor the system to work, both the maker of the generative AI tool used to make content and the platform used to distribute the contents must both agree to use the industry standard.\n\nIf a person uses OpenAI's Dall-E tool to generate an image, for example, OpenAI attaches a watermark to the resulting image. If that marked image is then uploaded to TikTok, it will be automatically labeled as AI-generated.\n\nTikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, has 170 million users in the United States, which recently passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban. TikTok and ByteDance have sued to block the law, arguing it violates the First Amendment.\n\nTikTok already labels AI-generated content made with tools inside the app but the latest move would apply a label to content generated outside of the service.\n\n\"We also have policies that prohibit realistic AI that is not labeled, so if realistic AI (generated contents) appears on the platform, then we will remove it as violating our community guidelines,\" Adam Presser, head of operations and trust and safety at TikTok, said in an interview.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Insiders at the Magnificent Seven tech companies are following Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg in realizing gains from the stocks that have largely powered the boom in US equity markets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Arm Slides as Tepid Outlook Fuels Concerns Over AI Slowdown Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump’s Demeanor\n\nAlmost a dozen executives and directors at the firms recently boosted their share sales, earning more than $160 million since late 2023 after not cutting their stakes in as long as nine years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTake Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai. He’s already sold more stock in Google’s parent company this year than in all of 2023, pocketing $30 million overall from almost two dozen sales filed as recently as this month. Alphabet’s shares have gained more than 90% since the start of last year.\n\nRead More: Google Founders’ Hand-Picked CEO Nears Billionaire Status Too\n\nNvidia Inc. director Mark Perry has sold more stock so far this year than in the previous two years. And Apple Inc. Chairman Arthur Levinson filed in February to offload his biggest chunk of the iPhone-maker’s stock in more than two decades.\n\nA representative for Alphabet said Pichai’s sales were done through a trading plan. Nvidia declined to comment, while Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe moves underscore how Silicon Valley insiders are monetizing their holdings after tech stocks rallied to fresh records, rebounding from a 2022 slump caused by accelerating inflation and interest-rate hikes. Nvidia is the best performer among the Magnificent Seven stocks — and third-best on the S&P 500 Index — this year with an 83% gain.\n\n“They all understand that pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered,” said Lloyd Greif, founder of Los Angeles-based investment bank Greif & Co. “No one can time the top of the stock market perfectly, and it certainly looks pretty frothy right now.”\n\nThe cohort of seven tech companies that also includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. has risen nearly 150% since the start of last year, partly because of investors’ appetite for any stocks that offer exposure to artificial intelligence.\n\nRecent quarterly earnings showed the rally still has legs, with all except Meta gaining after their reports. Nvidia, scheduled to report later this month, is the only Magnificent Seven company that has yet to release results.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven insiders in the companies that aren’t doing well are selling. Unlike its Magnificent Seven peers, Tesla’s share price has slumped this year but that hasn’t stopped Chair Robyn Denholm filing this year to sell about $52 million of the electric-vehicle maker’s stock after not touching her stake since 2022.\n\nThe Australian native, who filed a 10b5-1 trading plan in October to help her unload stock options expiring this year, joined Tesla’s board in August 2014. The company’s shares have climbed more than 800% since the end of that month, meaning she’s most likely sitting on big gains even with the recent slump.\n\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nBezos, Zuckerberg\n\nThe biggest overall winner from the Magnificent Seven’s recent rally is Amazon founder Bezos, who netted about $8.5 billion unloading stock over less than two weeks in February. The sales, his first since 2021, came shortly after he announced that he was moving to tax-free Florida from Washington state, which recently introduced a capital gains tax.\n\nRead More: Jeff Bezos Reaps Florida Tax Benefit With $4 Billion Amazon Sale\n\nZuckerberg’s trust as well as entities for his charitable and political giving began unloading shares through a trading plan in November and they’ve since filed to sell more than $1 billion worth. The latest of those sales was well timed, as Meta’s stock price has since fallen about 5% since then.\n\nA representative for Zuckerberg said he mainly sells shares through trading plans to fund his and his wife Priscilla Chan’s philanthropy.\n\nBezos, 60, and Zuckerberg, 39, have a combined fortune of about $378 billion, with most of their wealth still tied up in their Amazon and Meta stakes, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nPut all the insider transactions together, and “you feel they are calling a bit of the top of the market,” said Claire Madden, managing partner of London-based private equity firm Connection Capital.\n\nSome top leaders are offloading shares for the first time.\n\nAlphabet President Ruth Porat netted about $6.6 million selling shares in the search-engine giant in March, her first ever sales since she joined the Silicon Valley company in 2015 after spending more than two decades at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAlphabet’s stock has surged more than 500% since Porat swapped Wall Street for California. With US presidential elections later this year and the Federal Reserve indicating it’s not cutting interest rates just yet, it’s not surprising many insiders are cashing in on the recent rally, Greif said.\n\n“No one wants to get caught standing in a game of musical chairs when the music stops,” he said.\n\n--With assistance from Rita Nazareth and Jack Witzig.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "While it isn't necessarily a great idea to buy a stock just because a billionaire owns it, looking at the top holdings of some of the most successful investors in the world can be a great starting point to finding excellent opportunities.\n\nThere are several stocks that are popular among billionaires I wouldn't touch right now. But there are others that look extremely attractive at current levels. Here are two in particular that could be massive long-term winners for patient investors that are worth a closer look right now.\n\nA rock-solid bank with long-tailed potential\n\nIt's well known that the largest stock position in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio is tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). But the second largest stock chosen by Warren Buffett for the conglomerate's massive portfolio could be the better value right now.\n\nI'm talking about Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Berkshire owns 13.2% of the mega-bank, a stake worth more than $39 billion as of this writing. In fact, during the banking turmoil in mid-2023, Buffett unloaded several bank stocks, but specifically called out Bank of America as one he likes.\n\nBank of America is a highly profitable business, but it isn't without its headwinds. The bank's cost of capital has risen in the current interest rate environment and its net interest margin has declined by 21 basis points over the past year. And like most banks, Bank of America's net charge-off ratio has increased significantly over the past year.\n\nHowever, Bank of America is a tremendous institution that could be a big beneficiary once interest rates start to fall. It has the No. 1 retail deposit market share and continues to grow impressively. Unlike several other megabanks, Bank of America's deposit base has grown over the past year, and it added 245,000 net new checking accounts and more than 1 million credit card accounts in the first quarter alone. Its investment banking market share is 115 basis points higher than a year ago. And client balances in the Global Wealth and Investment Management business are at an all-time high of $4 trillion.\n\nIn a nutshell, Bank of America is well positioned for when rates start to fall and economic uncertainty starts to subside. Plus, it trades for a lower price-to-book valuation than its peers, despite being a rock-solid institution.\n\nBillionaires love this Magnificent Seven stock\n\nBill Ackman, head of the Pershing Square hedge fund, is one of the most closely followed billionaires. Like Buffett, most of the stocks he buys are more toward the value end of the spectrum. In fact, there's only one technology stock you'll find in Ackman's portfolio, and it happens to be Pershing Square's single largest investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm talking about Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). At the end of 2023, Pershing Square owned 13.7 million shares of the tech giant, a stake worth more than $2.3 billion today. And it isn't just Ackman: Alphabet is the most commonly held tech stock among the most notable hedge fund managers, according to our research.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Ackman and other billionaires might be a big fan of Alphabet. It's rare to find a highly profitable business that dominates an industry like Google dominates internet search and several other areas, and it's even more rare when the business also has massive growth potential.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, in addition to the familiar Google businesses like search, YouTube, Gmail, and others, Alphabet also has Google Cloud, which is the third largest cloud services company in the market and has tons of room to grow. The global cloud computing market is expected to roughly quadruple by 2030, fueled by technologies like AI, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and more, so even if Google Cloud simply maintains its market share, there could be massive potential.\n\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew by 15%, led by 28% year-over-year revenue growth from Google Cloud. The business is an absolute cash machine, with a 32% operating margin, and the company is buying back tons of stock and just announced its first-ever quarterly dividend.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nTo be perfectly clear, it's not a smart idea to buy stocks just because billionaires own them. Even if the billionaire happens to be named Warren Buffett. After all, billionaires may have investment goals and risk tolerance levels that differ greatly from yours.\n\nHaving said that, these two billionaire favorites are also excellent businesses with long-tailed growth tailwinds. If you have the patience to hold them for at least the next few years, they could certainly be worth a closer look right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nA fresh Big Tech boomlet has arrived.\n\nShareholders aren't just seeing their stock prices swell, they are getting paid too. The dividend, its importance demoted over the past couple of decades by the tech boom, is having a moment again thanks in part to the same companies that made it passé.\n\nIn February, META (META) initiated a dividend, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed in April. And then came an increase from Apple (AAPL) last week.\n\nBut why are tech companies initiating payouts, and why now?\n\nThe dividend trend reflects the double role that tech giants hold in society and on Wall Street. They want to be perceived as growth engines, obsessed with frontier tech and fixated on reshaping the future. But they are also mature, cash-rich companies with market caps that start with a \"T.\"\n\nThe former fledglings are now apex predators, seasoned with decades of experience balancing new investments with their core business, which happens to be expanding to virtually every domain of life.\n\nStartup versions of these companies would scoff at the idea of paying back a dividend. It suggests their growth days are behind them, that executives don't have a vision for how to deploy their resources. But in this post-pandemic, pre-AI moment, Big Tech wants to prove they can do two things at once: build the infrastructure to dominate the coming era and show investors they have the fiscal discipline and confidence to return value consistently.\n\nThat the recent wave of dividend announcements has come alongside disclosures of ballooning AI spending reinforces the dual message.\n\nBut it also reflects a reenergized corporate America that has shaken off fears of the recession that never was. Earnings are rising and with it are massive stock buybacks. The recent wave of repurchases, including Apple's record-breaking $110 billion plan, is the largest sum of buybacks since 2018.\n\n\"These companies have seen record profits for some time now and are finding value in passing that profit to shareholders rather than capex,\" said Alex McGrath, chief investment officer at NorthEnd Private Wealth. \"Not to say they are not still heavily investing in growth, but the cash flow has now reached a point where this begins to make sense.\"\n\nShareholder payouts, even modest ones from the tech companies, also grant them entry into funds that require a dividend. They are broadening their pool of investors, drawing from portfolios that seek steady income from dividends and people who simply want to see the \"number go up\" on their brokerage accounts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was the staggering gains of internet companies that played a part in making the dividend seem stodgy and antiquated. Top members of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\" come from the consumer staples and industrials sectors. When you typically think of dividends, you're disconnected from ideas of rapid growth, more risk, and big gains.\n\nBut the mega tech companies have changed. And so has what a dividend company looks like. Just look at Mark Zuckerberg's glow up.\n\n\"If they keep the money internally, there is a tendency to have waste. By paying it out, it instills discipline,\" said Jennifer Koski, professor of finance at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington, who has been teaching dividend cases for the Big Tech companies since before Microsoft (MSFT) initiated its own in 2003. \"The AI spending is their signal we still do have growth opportunities.\"\n\nIn a sign of where things are headed, Koski is planning to teach her next payout policy case. This time, on Amazon (AMZN).\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter @hshaban. morning brief image\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) AI push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros packing an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit.\n\nBut it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.\n\nBut the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will serve up at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.\n\nThe M4 and AI\n\nApple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.\n\nMillet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nOutside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly.\n\nThe company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths.\n\nStill, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important.\n\nThe company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party.\n\nCEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months, and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.\n\nThat includes buying up smaller AI firms, and, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, holding talks with both OpenAI and Google about potentially using their large language models to power Apple’s AI experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expect Apple’s generative AI offerings to serve as a catalyst in helping to boost iPhone sales at a time when consumers are increasingly holding on to their phones longer and splashy new features differentiating one generation from another are in short supply.\n\nNow Apple just has to deliver.

        "title": "Google Search Claims Another Victim: Tripadvisor Lowers Outlook",
        "content": "Tripadvisor offered a muted outlook across its major businesses, and attributed the softness to changes in Google’s travel search results pages.\n\nTripadvisor pointed to Google’s free, organic search results as the culprit. Last week, Trivago said Google’s changes to paid advertising formats were hitting its financial results too.\n\nCommenting on diminished travel demand in April and into May, Tripadvisor Chief Financial Officer Michael Noonan said Wednesday during the company’s first-quarter earnings call: “We also witnessed a wide-reaching update to the (Google) travel SERP (Search Engine Results Page) that extended for a more prolonged period of time than typical updates that we have seen in the past.”\n\nOfficials said the changes to search engine results pages on Google, which has roughly a 90% grip on search according to various accounts, began late last year and continued into the first quarter.\n\nGiven these pressures from Google, for the second quarter, Noonan stated:\n\nConsolidated revenue for the whole company is expected to be flat or to increase “slightly” compared to the prior year period, and adjusted EBITDA margins would fall around 100 basis points.\n\nTripadvisor hotel metasearch, or Brand Tripadvisor, would see revenue fall single to high-single digits, and falling adjusted EBITDA margins would be more than margin improvement at Viator and TheFork.\n\nRevenue from Tripadvisor’s tours and activities brand Viator in the second quarter is expected to decline “a couple of points” compared with the first quarter’s gross booking value growth of 15%.\n\nDining reservations platform TheFork would see “a step-down in growth” to “low- to mid-teens year over-year-growth” because of the Google changes and the timing of the Easter holiday.\n\nNoonan said because of forecasted second-quarter trends, the company is “taking a more cautious view” about full-year 2024 expectations. “We now expected consolidated revenue to grow in the low- to mid-single digits and adjusted EBITDA of flat to low single-digit growth.”\n\nThe friction from Google occurred as controlling shareholder Liberty Tripadvisor and Tripadvisor separately announced Wednesday that a sale proposal that Liberty received in February would not lead to a deal.\n\nIn an earnings call, Liberty Tripadvisor’s Greg Maffei, who is the chairman of Tripadvisor, said talks are ongoing between Liberty Tripadvsior and a Tripadvisor special committee about “strategic alternatives.”\n\nTripadvisor’s share price fell nearly 30% midday Wednesday.\n\nThe Google Problem\n\nTripadvisor didn’t detail what about the changes Google made to its travel search results pages dented Tripadvisor’s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent months, Google’s algorithmic changes have tended to de-index and penalize websites that Google believes don’t offer high-value content. It isn’t clear if that affected Tripadvisor.\n\nTrivago, which offers hotel comparison price shopping along with Tripadvisor, has emphasized the difficulties in navigating changes to Google’s advertising formats, including the use of more carousels and deemphasizing text ads.\n\nA Google sponsored ad for hotels. Source: Google/Skift\n\nThe Digital Markets Act in the European Union has also altered the way travel search results get displayed on Google, although Goldberg said the DMA changes don’t necessarily “correlate” to the adverse impact that Google is feeling.\n\nBright Spots for Tripadvisor\n\nOfficials said teams at Tripadvisor are working to mitigate the adverse changes coming from Google.\n\n“It takes time to readjust when things change like that,” Noonan said.\n\nHe said Tripadvisor is pleased how other channels, such as the Tripadvisor app, and paid-marketing efforts are advancing.\n\nGoldberg concurred that the Tripadvisor app is performing well, although its number of users are smaller than in other channels.\n\nHe added that Tripadvisor and Viator have an advantage because Tripadvisor is a Google partner and Tripadvisor employees talk to Google frequently.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tech Giants Alphabet And Meta Pay Dividends Now - But Are They Worth It?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nTech behemoths are known for their stellar growth potential, which results in significant capital gains. However, they are typically not popular with investors seeking dividend payouts for steady passive income.\n\nNonetheless, in a significant move reflecting a shift in strategy and a maturing stage of growth, both Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have announced plans to pay dividends to their shareholders alongside massive share buyback programs.\n\nStellar Earnings and First Dividend Payouts\n\nMeta Platforms, formerly Facebook, took the market by storm with its announcement of a quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share for the first time in its history back in February. The social media giant also revealed an expanded $50 billion share buyback program.\n\nThis decision came as Meta reported financials for the last quarter of 2023 exceeded expectations. Revenues amounted to $40.1 billion, surpassing the Wall Street estimate of $39.18 billion. Furthermore, the company's bottom line came in at $5.33, beating the consensus estimate of $4.96.\n\n\"Introducing a dividend just gives us a more balanced capital return program and some added flexibility in how we return capital in the future,\" said Susan Li, Meta Platforms CFO.\n\nSimilarly, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, unveiled its plans to pay its first-ever dividend of $0.20 per share last month, alongside a massive $70 billion share buyback program. This decision followed Alphabet’s impressive first-quarter results, which surpassed analysts’ expectations.\n\nAlphabet's total revenues amounted to $80.54 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, marking the fastest growth since 2022. EPS came in at $1.89, surpassing the consensus analyst estimate of $1.89.\n\nDividends signify a shift in the companies’ approach, from solely focusing on growth to also prioritizing returning value to shareholders.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These three reliable high-yield ETFs will put your income investments on autopilot. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.\n\nMeta's Slowing Growth Projection\n\nMeta Platforms announced its first-quarter earnings results during the last week of April.  However, the market reception of the tech giant's stellar growth was underwhelming. The company's revenues grew 27% year-over-year to $28.65 billion, marking the fastest quarterly growth since 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's projected sales for the second quarter range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of this range, at $37.75 billion, reflects an 18% year-over-year growth rate, falling short of analysts’ average prediction of $38.3 billion.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted initiatives such as advancements in glasses and mixed reality, areas where the company currently lacks profitability. He also emphasized the escalating investments in artificial intelligence. However, this resulted in a steep sell-off, as META stock fell by 16% intraday on April 24.\n\nFor years, investors have been drawn to tech stocks like Meta and Alphabet for their growth potential. While dividends offer a steady income stream, they may not match the exponential growth that these companies have historically provided. Moreover, the tech stalwarts don't have a steady history of paying dividends, which might deter investors who seek reliable quarterly dividend payouts.\n\nCapturing Growth and Income\n\nWhile Meta and Alphabet’s decision to pay dividends is a significant shift in their strategies, it’s important to note that these payouts are unlikely to amount to substantial returns in the form of income for investors. Meta’s forward dividend yield currently stands at a mere 0.11%, while Alphabet’s is only slightly higher at 0.12%. These low yields indicate that both companies are still very much focused on growth rather than providing meaningful income to shareholders.\n\nFor investors who want to capture the growth potential of Meta and Alphabet while also generating steady income, diversifying their portfolios with real estate investments could be an attractive option. Platforms like Arrived offer a unique opportunity to invest in rental properties without the hassle of being a landlord, and the minimum investment is only $100.\n\nBy investing through Arrived, individuals can own shares of carefully selected rental properties in high-growth markets across the United States. This allows investors to benefit from the potential appreciation of the properties while also earning regular rental income. Moreover, Arrived’s team of experts handles all aspects of property management, making it a truly passive investment experience.

This approach can provide a more well-rounded investment strategy, catering to both long-term growth and steady income generation.\n\nWant to explore more private market real estate options?

        "content": "Google Briefly Lost Ownership Of Its Domain After It Was Mistakenly Sold For $12 To A Former Employee\n\nEven tech giants make mistakes. In a surprising incident from 2015, Google once briefly lost ownership of its domain, Google.com, as reported by CNN.\n\nSanmay Ved, a former employee, managed to buy the domain late at night while exploring Google’s domain service platform. To his utter shock, Google.com was listed as available, and he purchased it for just $12.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women’s health problem at 80 cents per share. This Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here’s how anyone can invest for a limited time.\n\nVed shared a detailed account of an unexpected incident on LinkedIn, describing how he stumbled upon the availability of \"google.com\" on Google Domains. At 1:20 a.m. Eastern Time, he was exploring the platform when he entered the domain into the search bar and was surprised to find it listed as available. Contrary to usual indications, the option to add the domain to his cart was visible, which is typically not seen unless a domain is genuinely available for sale.\n\nUpon clicking the \"add to cart\" icon, the domain was successfully added to his cart, confirmed by a green checkmark. Ved proceeded to checkout, curious to see if the transaction would go through. He recalled, \"I was hoping I would get an error at some time saying the transaction did not go through, but I was able to complete the purchase, and my credit card was actually charged!\"\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.\n\nHe immediately received access to Google Webmaster Tools notifications, confirming his temporary ownership. He provided screenshots of the emails and proof of the charge appearing on his credit card as well.\n\nVed also reported the incident to Google Security. In his post, he mentioned, \"Google has reverted, has acknowledged the incident, and is investigating into the incident.\"\n\nGoogle reached out and was reportedly \"excited\" to compensate Ved with $6,000.13, an amount humorously reflecting the brand’s name numerically. When Ved decided to donate the sum to charity, Google commendably doubled the reward to $12,000.\n\nThis incident exposed a rare lapse in Google’s domain registration services and provided significant security insights. Following the incident in 2015, Google paid out a total of $2 million to researchers who identified vulnerabilities across its platforms, underscoring the importance of security vigilance and the value of ethical hacking.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle continues to offer significant rewards through its Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP), although the amounts vary depending on the severity and impact of the vulnerabilities discovered. In 2023, Google paid out $10 million to security researchers. This amount represents a slight decrease from the $12 million paid out in 2022. The highest reward in 2023 for a single vulnerability was $113,337, showcasing Google’s ongoing commitment to compensating those who help enhance the security of its platforms.\n\nGoogle has also broadened the scope of its Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs) to include emerging threats and new technology areas such as generative AI, further emphasizing the program’s expansion and its importance to Google’s overall security strategy. This strategic approach not only enhances product security but also fosters a robust relationship with the global security research community, encouraging more participants to contribute to the safety of Google’s expansive suite of services.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nInvest like a millionaire.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google DeepMind has released a new version of AlphaFold, a landmark tool for predicting protein structures, that puts the artificial intelligence software on a path to make breakthroughs in biology research and bolster a business that Google’s AI chief says could be worth north of $100 billion.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmericans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump’s Demeanor Trump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial Microsoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings\n\nThe AI system has the potential to revolutionize medicine and create “enormous commercial value,” for DeepMind spinout Isomorphic Labs, Demis Hassabis, the chief executive officer of both subsidiaries, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “I hope to do both with Isomorphic: build a multi-hundred billion dollar business — I think it has that potential — as well as be incredibly beneficial for society and humanity.’’Isomorphic Labs, a unit of Alphabet Inc. created three years ago, was built to commercialize DeepMind’s AI for drug discovery. DeepMind first released AlphaFold in 2018, with advances in decoding the shape of proteins, a scientific problem often compared to mapping the human genome. Now in its third iteration, AlphaFold can model a range of molecular structures, including DNA and RNA, and predict how they interact with one another.\n\n“To really understand biology, you need to think about the interactions between different biological molecules,” Hassabis said. “And that's what AlphaFold 3 is a big step towards.”\n\nHassabis described the update, which was also published in the scientific journal Nature, as “essential for drug discovery” because of its critical insight into the kinds of chemical compounds used in designing and testing new medicine, including vaccines. “I would be expecting, maybe in the next couple of years, the first AI-designed drugs in the clinic,” Hassabis added.\n\nAI in medicine is a hot field. It’s driven by a belief that software algorithms can find and help develop new drugs at drastically lower costs and much faster than the decades it can take now. The craze has drawn pharmaceutical firms, venture capitalists and tech giants like Nvidia Corp. into a market worth an estimated $50 billion. Investors have poured more than $18 billion into “AI-first” biotech companies in the past decade.\n\nBut even with more cash and computing advances, companies working on the tech have yet to show major clinical success. Some biotech firms specializing in AI drug discovery, such as BenevolentAI and Exscientia Plc, have struggled in public markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January, Isomorphic Labs announced its first two commercial partners, Eli Lilly & Co. and Novartis — alliances the tech company said “could be worth nearly $3 billion” if they’re successful on a range of performance milestones.\n\nAlphabet has tried turning its health-care innovations into new business opportunities before, with units such as Verily, a “precision health” platform for managing medical data. But those have shown limited commercial success so far.\n\nHassabis has previously said that Google will spend more than $100 billion to develop its AI arsenal. “The benefits of the generative AI models, things like drug discovery, are going to far outweigh these costs in the long run,” he said in the interview this week. DeepMind is responsible for some of Google’s biggest advances in AI research. Since merging with Google’s other AI units last year, DeepMind now leads the company’s efforts on Gemini, its foundational AI model competing with OpenAI.\n\nTo create AlphaFold 3, Hassabis said his researchers rebuilt the program “from the ground up,” using methods that account for shortcomings in prior versions, like a deficit of training data. The new version relies on an AI technique used in generative AI, called a diffusion model, that allows computers to do things like turn text into hyper-realistic images. In the Nature paper, DeepMind researchers write that their model predicts certain molecular interactions — proteins with nucleic acid and antibodies with antigens — at a higher accuracy than existing computer models. “It’s a lot more generalizable,” Hassabis said of the new model. “And it’s a lot more powerful.”\n\nAlong with the update, DeepMind is launching AlphaFold Server, a tool that gives outsiders access to a bulk of the program’s functions. Hassabis said millions of researchers have used AlphaFold so far, although they “have to be a little bit technical” to deploy the program effectively. “The Server is even simpler,” he said. “If you’re a biologist, you don't need to understand the model or the technology at all.”\n\nDeepMind will offer the tool to scientists for “non-commercial use.” Although Hassabis added that Isomorphic Lab’s pharmaceutical partners will have access to the Server and other more advanced tools.\n\n--With assistance from Naomi Kresge.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs reveal AI able to predict large swathes of molecular biology",
        "content": "Alphabet’s GoogleDeepMind and its sister company Isomorphic Labs have created a new AI model that they say can help predict both the structure and interaction of most molecules involved in biological processes, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and some of chemicals used to create new medicines.\n\nThe new model is a potentially giant leap for biological research. The companies are allowing researchers working on non-commerical projects to query the model for free through an internet-based interface.\n\nIsomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google DeepMind, has also begun using the system internally to speed its efforts to discover new drugs. The company currently has partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis aimed at developing multiple drugs, although the specifics of which diseases the companies are targeting has not been revealed.\n\nProteins are the building blocks of life and their interactions with one another and with other molecules are the mechanism through which life’s processes happen. Being able to predict those interactions more accurately will help researchers advance science. by helping them understand the mechanism behind diseases, and, potentially, how to better treat and cure them.\n\nCalled AlphaFold 3, the new AI software represents a major update and expansion of capabilities beyond Google DeepMind’s previous AlphaFold 2 system. Researchers from the companies published a paper on AlphaFold 3 today in the prestigious scientific journal Nature.\n\nDemis Hassabis, who serves as CEO of both Google DeepMind and Isomorphic, described the new model’s interaction predictions as “incredibly important for drug discovery.”\n\nJohn Jumper, the senior researcher who heads the protein structure team at Google DeepMind, described AlphaFold 3 as “an evolution of AlphaFold 2, but a really big one that opens up new avenues.” He also said he was excited to see what researchers would do with the new model, noting that AlphaFold 2 had already opened up new areas of biological research that he could never have imagined. AlphaFold 2 has been cited more than 20,000 times in other published scientific papers and has been used to work on drugs for malaria, cancer, and many other diseases.\n\nAlphaFold 2 and 3\n\nDebuted in late 2020, AlphaFold 2 solved a grand scientific challenge because it was able to accurately predict the structure of most proteins simply from their DNA sequence. The company later published the system’s predicted structures for all 200 million proteins with known DNA sequences and made them freely available to scientists in a massive database. Prior to this, only about 100,000 proteins had known structural information.\n\nStory continues\n\nKnowing the shape and structure of a protein is often a key part of understanding how it will function. But proteins do not work in isolation. And AlphaFold 2 was not designed to predict how proteins would interact with one another—although scientists soon found ways to modify AlphaFold 2 to make some of these predictions. Nor could AlphaFold 2 predict protein interactions with other kinds of molecules, such as DNA, RNA, ligands, and ions, that are found inside living things. It also could not predict the interaction of these other molecules with one another. AlphaFold 3 can.\n\nThe system is not always accurate, but represents a major leap forward in performance. According to tests conducted by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic, AlphaFold 3 can accurately predict 76% of protein interactions with small molecules, compared to 52% for the previous best predictive software. It can predict 65% of DNA interactions compared to the next leading system, which only achieves 28%. And in protein to protein interactions, it can predict 62% accurately, more than doubling what AlphaFold 2 could do.\n\nLike AlphaFold 2, AlphaFold 3 also includes a confidence score alongside its predictions that give scientists some indication of whether they should trust the system’s output. This reduces the chance that the AI model will experience the sort of \"hallucinations\"—plausible but inaccurate outputs—that have plagued recent generative AI models.\n\nJumper said that so far researchers have found these confidence scores to be highly correlated with whether the structural and interaction predictions are accurate. In other words, the system is not likely to be confidently wrong.\n\nThere are a few classes of proteins where AlphaFold 3 is still not accurate. These include proteins that scientists consider “intrinsically disordered,” meaning they only assume a particular structure in the presence of another protein or molecule, perhaps changing their shape radically depending on circumstance, according to Max Jaderberg, the chief AI scientist at Isomorphic Labs.\n\nBioweapons worries\n\nWhile many, including former Google DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, who is now heading up a new consumer AI division at Microsoft, and Dario Amodei, the confounder and CEO of Google DeepMind rival Anthropic, have warned that rapid advances in AI may lead to the proliferation of bioweapons by radically lowering the knowledge barrier to creating deadly pathogens, Jumper said Google DeepMind and Isomorphic had consulted more than 50 experts in biosecurity, bioethics, and AI safety and concluded that the marginal risk AlphaFold 3 might present in terms of bioweapons creation was far outweighed by the system’s potential benefits to science, including advancing human understanding of disease and finding possible treatments.\n\nThe two companies are also only allowing access to the model through an internet service that allows outside researchers to prompt the system and receive a prediction, but does not give them access to the model itself or its underlying computer code.\n\nUnlike some efforts to create large language models (LLMs) for biology that can be prompted in natural language to produce a formula for a compound with particular properties, AlphaFold 3 still requires someone to have a fairly good understanding of biology to use it effectively. In addition, any suggested molecular structure it predicts would still need to be produced or isolated in a lab, a process that also requires relatively specialized knowledge.\n\nAlphaFold 3 uses a significantly different AI design than its predecessor AlphaFold 2. While both AI models are based around transformers, a kind of artificial neural network architecture pioneered by Google researchers in 2017, Jumper said the team working on the new system replaced entire “blocks” of the large transformer that powered AlphaFold 2.\n\nAlphaFold 2 relied heavily on evolutionary information about the proteins for which it was trying to predict structures, while AlphaFold 3 leans on this evolutionary signal far less, using it only at the first step of its structure prediction. Instead, the new system devotes the majority of its components to working through the physical shape of the molecules it is making predictions about.\n\nAlphaFold 3 also uses a diffusion model, similar to ones used for popular text-to-image generation models such as OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 or Midjourney, to learn how to puzzle out the precise atomic structures of molecules. Overall, despite covering far more substances than AlphaFold 2, AlphaFold 3 is a simpler design, with fewer separate components, than its predecessor.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) stock popped as much as 5% Wednesday after the company said in its first-ever quarterly earnings report that it expects better-than-expected sales growth in the current quarter and further progress on profitability.\n\nReddit said in its release on Tuesday that it expects Q2 revenue in the range of $240 million to $255 million, above Wall Street's estimates for $228 million. The social media company also said it sees adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter in the range of $0 to $15 million. The Street had been expecting a loss of $13 million.\n\nReddit's daily active users hit 82.7 million, up 9% from the prior quarter and faster than analysts had projected.\n\n\"Reddit delivered a strong first quarter post its IPO, in our view,\" Citi analyst Ronald Josey wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"Importantly, we believe improving engagement trends are lasting.\"\n\nAfter initially soaring following its public offering in late March, Reddit shares tanked in the followingweeks, falling from a peak of about $74 per share to just below $40 as concerns over the company's lofty valuation and future potential revenue streams mounted.\n\nBut the report from the company that once hosted fodder for meme stock targets highlighted a trend recently seen in other names favored by retail traders. Reddit stock is moving higher after a quarter JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth described as \"strong,\" but not surging higher to a point that's hard for analysts to reason with.\n\n\"We expect trends to remain strong through the year given recent tailwinds, and we raise our 2024 & 2025 revenue estimates by 11% & 12%, respectively,\" Anmuth wrote.\n\nAnmuth maintained a Neural rating on the stock while raising his price target to $57 from $47, noting that shares appear \"fairly valued\" right now.

CLARY via Getty Images)\n\nBullish strategists on Wall Street highlight that Reddit's future prospects in artificial intelligence, through use cases like selling its data to large language model providers, will drive more growth than is currently priced in.\n\nReddit CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman flexed the social media platform's large database, which Alphabet is already paying to have access to, during his opening remarks on Tuesday night's earnings call.\n\n\"We have nearly two decades of authentic conversation, unique perspectives, earnest advice, honest reviews and answers the questions about every topic imaginable,\" Huffman said.\n\nThis, Needham analyst Laura Martin, argued in a research note could be crucial to Reddit's future growth. Martin added Reddit to Needham's \"conviction list\" with a buy rating and $63 price target, noting optimism about Reddit's upside from licensing its data to train generative AI large language models.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We also believe that there are no high-quality substitutes at similar scale, which should give RDDT pricing power,\" Martin wrote. \" We believe RDDT's data will become table stakes for all GenAI LLMs over time.\"\n\nFor now, that eventual path to AI data licensing deals remains unclear, though. Huffman said on the earnings call there are a \"handful of large player and many more smaller opportunities,\" and the company is looking into both. Huffman declined to comment on any active negations.\n\n\"We're in early days here,\" Huffman said. \"I'd say, big picture, we have seen an increase in interest in Reddit's data for various uses. And so, look forward to how this grows looking forward.\"\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings",
        "content": "Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.\n\nDespite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are once again on investors’ radars.\n\nAnalysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings, noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.\n\nApart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization. And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.\n\nAs a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.\n\nStory continues\n\niShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) iShares by Blackrock sign\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.\n\nTherefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW) stands out as a compelling choice. This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.\n\nSince its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.\n\nAmong its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).\n\nIYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.\n\nRecently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.\n\nInvestors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.\n\nSo far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil had both long and short positions in META stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "UPDATE 4-Hong Kong court bans protest anthem, says it can be used as weapon",
        "content": "(Adds U.S. comment paragraph 10)\n\nBy Jessie Pang\n\nHONG KONG, May 8 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted an application by the government to ban a protest anthem called \"Glory to Hong Kong\", overturning a lower court judgment that had rejected such a ban because of its possible \"chilling effects\" on free speech.\n\nThe ruling comes amid what critics say is an erosion in Hong Kong's rule of law and individual rights amid a security crackdown by Beijing that has seen scores of opposition democrats jailed and shut down liberal media outlets.\n\nThe case has implications for internet freedoms and the operations of firms including internet platform operators (IPOs) and technology firms such as Google.\n\nCourt of Appeal judges Jeremy Poon, Carlye Chu and Anthea Pang wrote that the composer of the protest song had intended it to be used as a weapon.\n\n\"In the hands of those with the intention to incite secession and sedition, the song can be deployed to arouse anti-establishment sentiments,\" the judges wrote.\n\nThe judges added that \"an injunction is necessary to persuade the IPOs to remove the problematic videos in connection with the song\" from their platforms.\n\n\"Although the IPOs have not taken part in these proceedings, they have indicated that they are ready to accede to the Government’s request if there is a court order.\"\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a press briefing: \"Preventing anyone from using or disseminating the relevant song...is a legitimate and necessary measure by (Hong Kong) to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security.\"\n\nHong Kong's Secretary for Justice said the government \"will communicate with relevant internet service providers, request or demand them to remove relevant content in accordance with the injunction order\".\n\nWashington has expressed concerns over the erosion of rights in Hong Kong. The ban was \"the latest blow to the international reputation of a city that previously prided itself on having an independent judiciary, protecting the free exchange of information, ideas and goods,\" U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee its freedoms would be preserved under a \"one country, two systems\" formula.\n\nHong Kong does not have its own anthem. \"Glory to Hong Kong\" was written in 2019 amid mass pro-democracy protests that year and was considered an unofficial national anthem, rather than China's \"March of the Volunteers\".\n\nStory continues\n\nThe court ruling targets those who broadcast or distribute the song with the intention of inciting others to commit secession, or those who suggest Hong Kong is an independent state, or who insult the national anthem.\n\nExceptions would only be granted to lawful academic and journalistic activities, the judges added.\n\nThe Hong Kong government sought an appeal after High Court Judge Anthony Chan refused to ban the protest anthem last July, saying that it could undermine freedom of expression and cause potential \"chilling effects\".\n\nThe government applied for the injunction last June after it was mistakenly played at several international events as the official anthem, including a Rugby Sevens game and an ice hockey competition.\n\nGoogle told Reuters it was reviewing the judgment. It had earlier said it would not change its search results to display China's national anthem rather than the protest song when users search for Hong Kong's national anthem.\n\nDGX Music, the music group behind the song, did not respond to a Reuters request to comment.\n\nThe song was banned in Hong Kong schools after China imposed a national security law in 2020. In March, authorities enacted another set of security laws that some foreign governments say further undermine rights and free speech.\n\nBeijing rejects the accusation and says the security laws have brought stability.

        "title": "DeepMind Alumni Raise $200 Million Round for Holistic AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Holistic AI, a new startup in Paris working to leapfrog other generative AI models, has closed the first tranche of a $200 million initial financing round, according to people familiar with the deal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track One Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire Trump’s Private Life Exposed in Intimate Stormy Daniels Testimony\n\nInvestors agreed to put in $80 million in equity and $120 million in convertible debt, chiefly for buying computing power, said the people who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t yet public. They said the founding round values the company at $370 million.\n\nThe startup, formed by a group of scientists who recently left DeepMind, Google’s artificial intelligence lab, has audacious aims. It’s working to develop “multi-agent” models, a process where a number of AI systems interact with one another. The deal for the months-old startup marks continued intense interest in companies pushing forward in AI, with investors willing to take a bet on founding teams based on their employment history as much as their proposed product.\n\nIn an investor presentation, the startup described its goal to develop AI with skills like memory, planning and “tactical decision making” that AI systems have struggled with, according to a document viewed by Bloomberg News. “We build genuine AGI capabilities,” read the presentation, referencing theoretical AI systems that outperform humans on all tasks.\n\nBloomberg News first reported on the company’s creation and financing plans in January. Charles Kantor is a former venture resident at Stanford University’s business school. The other four members of the founding team are engineers who spent years at DeepMind working on some of its advanced models.\n\nVenture firm Accel Partners LP is participating in the round along with UiPath Inc., the people said. Other investors include Wendy and Eric Schmidt, Google’s former chief executive officer. Business Insider previously reported some of the details of the funding round.\n\nHolistic’s Chief Executive Officer Charles Kantor did not respond to a request for comment. UiPath did not return requests for comment.\n\nAccel, a fund based in California, was an early backer of Facebook, Dropbox and several other prominent internet companies. But the firm has steered clear of startups building foundational AI models, such as OpenAI and Mistral, another Parisian newcomer that raced to a $2 billion-plus valuation in its first year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccel also backed UiPath, a company formed in Romania that went public in 2021. UiPath sells robotic process automation software — tech that instructs bots to perform certain tasks within a company, like monitoring servers or backing up data. It’s distinct from the latest AI systems, which can detect patterns or generate text and images without human programming.\n\nIn its investor document, Holistic AI pitched a vision of moving “beyond” large language models like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini. The document said the startup was planning to target “multiple verticals” and revenue streams. “We are raising a large round to train the model and start going after these markets,” the presentation read.\n\n--With assistance from Lizette Chapman and Shona Ghosh.\n\n(Updates with UiPath involvement in seventh, ninth paragraphs)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags A New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Stock buybacks hit highest level since 2018",
        "content": "Stock buybacks are soaring in a sign that corporate America is bullish on the US economy.\n\nCompanies have announced share repurchases of more than $383 billion in the last 13 weeks, up 30% from the year-earlier period and the largest sum since June 2018, per research from Deutsche Bank. The total includes Apple's $110 billion plan, the largest buyback in history.\n\nThe equity strategy team at Deutsche Bank notes that the \"boom\" in buybacks extends beyond the big names like Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which just announced a $70 billion buyback plan. Of the $262 billion in buybacks reported in first quarter earnings season, $82 billion has come from companies outside the large tech giants.\n\nThis is a welcome sign for those looking for a broadening out of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Buybacks have been the biggest driver of equities over time in the medium term,\" Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha told Yahoo Finance ahead of the start of first quarter earnings reports.\n\nTo Chadha, the importance of buybacks is simple: They tell investors how companies feel about the macro environment.\n\nBuybacks typically rise when earnings rise, Chadha said. This is because as earnings rise, which is currently happening at its fastest pace in nearly two years, cash flow at companies increases. Companies can then use this cash flow to increase dividends paid to shareholders, increase capital expenditures to invest back in the company, or repurchase stock, and, in turn, return capital to shareholders.\n\nThis trend failed to materialize in 2023. Earnings picked up, but buybacks didn't. Chadha reasoned this likely had to do with the overwhelming majority projecting a recession to hit the US economy.\n\n\"When macro consensus is for a severe slowdown, or recession, companies aren't going to do buybacks,\" Chadha said. \"They're going to hold on to their cash.\"\n\nBut that macro consensus has shifted. Economists and macro strategists are feeling more optimistic about economic growth for the US this year. Corporations are confirming that confidence with buybacks.\n\n\"What you saw in [fourth quarter] earnings reporting earlier this year is that buybacks really started to move back up,\" Chadha said. \"So I'd say that this cloud of a cyclical overhang is lifting. Corporates are getting more comfortable with the outlook.\"\n\nJPMorgan Private Bank global investment strategist Elyse Ausenbaugh noted that the tick-up in buybacks provides a \"nice foundation for investors\" as companies buying back their stock helps support the market even if individual equity investors aren't pouring money into stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd taken one step further, Ausenbaugh sees buybacks as just part of the case building in first quarter earnings that companies are seeing higher cash flows and using them in ways that should eventually benefit shareholders, like boosted capital expenditures for Big Tech companies.\n\n[Boosted capex is] going to continue to power these trends that have offered a lot of support for the market, like AI,\" Ausenbaugh told Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "This Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Now in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "With the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in full force, investors continue to try and figure out ways to get a piece of the action. Luckily, you don't have to look very far.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), one of the world's most dominant enterprises, is at the forefront of this revolution. After it released 2024 first-quarter financials that were well-received by the market, shares continued their upswing. They are now up 59% in just the last 12 months.\n\nThis leading internet company is now valued at more than $2 trillion. Let's take a closer look at its recent financials, attractive qualities, and the stock's valuation.\n\nLooking at the latest results\n\nWall Street loves to focus on headline figures, such as revenue and earnings per share. Alphabet crushed expectations here. The top line came in at $80.5 billion, up 15% year over year. The bottom line increased 62% to total $1.89 per share. This is just the latest report that demonstrates the company's ability to maintain its strong fundamental performance.\n\nAll of Alphabet's segments did well. Ad revenue was up 13%, driven by a solid showing in Search and YouTube. This is an extremely encouraging trend to see, given that the ad industry was struggling in 2022. These days, the ad market is on much better footing.\n\nWhat makes Alphabet a fantastic AI stock, however, is its Google Cloud division. This segment already offers clients a laundry list of AI features in areas like generative AI, machine learning, image and video, data, and consulting. Google Cloud, which posted a Q1 revenue jump of 28% and operating income of $900 million, is becoming a leading AI infrastructure provider.\n\nSo many favorable qualities\n\nIt's not surprising that for Alphabet to get to the current $2 trillion valuation, it must possess some very attractive qualities. One such factor that can't be ignored are the powerful long-term tailwinds that have worked in the company's favor.\n\nOf course, the rise of smartphones and the internet in the past decade or more has propelled Alphabet to become the so-called gateway of the internet. Greater internet usage, with a corresponding greater number of internet users, results in a heightened ability for the business to monetize this activity via ads. And the popularity of streaming video has made YouTube a global entertainment powerhouse.\n\nGoing back to the topic of AI, there might be no business that's better positioned to take advantage of how this technology progresses. For starters, Alphabet has unmatched financial resources to the tune of $95 billion in net cash on the books and consistent free-cash-flow generation to invest heavily in researching, developing, and launching AI tools. It helps that the company's operating margin has averaged a superb 26.2% in the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut perhaps even more noteworthy, Alphabet has numerous products and services that are used by hundreds of millions and even billions of people. This gives the business an invaluable avenue by which to release these AI capabilities that can be used immediately by customers, helping drive greater revenue potential.\n\nThe valuation remains compelling\n\nInvestors will probably be surprised to know that this stock still looks inexpensive, even after its recent run-up. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 22.2.\n\nIf you decide to pay this valuation, you'd be getting one of the world's dominant enterprises, one that's incredibly profitable, has growth potential, is at the forefront of AI, and that owns some of the world's most popular services. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Alphabet just announced a new $70 billion share-repurchase program or that the business will now pay a $0.20 quarterly dividend to shareholders.\n\nEven as it currently sits in the exclusive $2 trillion club, investors should still consider buying Alphabet stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy now according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts.\n\nAs companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season. While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term \"AI\" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.\n\nWithin that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a \"trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure\" to transform computing from \"general purpose to accelerated.\"\n\nSince then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:\n\n\"So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.\n\nAnd, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward.\n\nFor Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that \"AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that \"60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) \"deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.\"\n\n\"And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\"\n\nSo, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with. A couple of notable names are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top analyst AI stock picks, we ranked the top 35 holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF by their average analyst share price target upside and selected the top AI stocks.

        "title": "OpenAI Is Readying a Search Product to Rival Google, Perplexity",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI is developing a feature for ChatGPT that can search the web and cite sources in its results, according to a person familiar with the matter, potentially competing head on with Alphabet Inc.’s Google and AI search startup Perplexity.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial One Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire Israel Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short Einhorn Says Markets Are ‘Broken.’ Here’s What Data Shows\n\nThe feature would allow users to ask ChatGPT a question and receive answers that use details from the web with citations to sources such as Wikipedia entries and blog posts, according to the person, who asked to remain anonymous discussing private information. One version of the product also uses images alongside written responses to questions, when they’re relevant. If a user asked ChatGPT how to change a doorknob, for instance, the results might include a diagram to illustrate the task, the person said.\n\nThe Information reported on a search product in development in February. The details on how the product might work have not previously been reported. OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nOpenAI is under immense pressure to expand the capabilities of its most well-known product as a growing list of rivals are pushing out chatbots — and search has proven to be a key area of interest for the AI industry. Perplexity has gained popularity — and a $1 billion valuation — by offering an AI-powered search engine that emphasizes accuracy and citations. Google has also been racing to rethink its core search experience around AI and is expected to reveal the latest plans for its Gemini AI models at its annual I/O event next week.\n\nOn social media, there has been tremendous speculation about OpenAI’s search plans. Some users on X, formerly known as Twitter, recently pointed to the existence of the web page search.chatgpt.com as an indicator that a search feature could be coming from OpenAI. Visitors to that URL will see a “not found” message in small type on the page, but over the weekend it briefly re-routed to chatgpt.com, the official website where users can interact with the chatbot.\n\nSuch a feature would expand on what OpenAI currently offers to some users. ChatGPT can automatically pull up search results online for certain queries — such as the current weather in San Francisco — but the feature is currently limited to those who pay for the chatbot. In some cases, this option also provides citations. But the product can have hiccups: When asked on Sunday, “What did President Biden do this weekend?” it said he was in Delaware. While accurate, it cited a news story from 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing Chris Dixon’s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto’s Grifty Reputation\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was Google’s first female engineer—only because she tried to delete a recruiter email and accidentally opened it instead",
        "content": "Marissa Mayer is most well-known for her stint as CEO of Yahoo, but before she took the helm of the tech giant, she took a serendipitous dive into the unknown by joining a then little-known startup called Google.\n\nAlthough she would later become Google’s 20th employee and first female engineer, as a graduating computer science major at Stanford during the height of the tech bubble in 1999, Mayer found herself with 14 job offers to major companies. Unsure of which to choose, Mayer took stock of all the good decisions she had made up until that time, according to an interview at Fortune’s MPW conference in 2011, which included picking Stanford, pivoting away from a major in medicine, and working in Switzerland for a summer.\n\nWhen she analyzed what made those choices great, she saw a common theme: Mayer thrived in the unknown.\n\n\"I always did something I felt a little unready to do,” she told Fortune.\n\nIn the end, it was a fluke that led her to considering Google as a career option. With a flurry of recruiter emails in her inbox, Mayer went to delete one, and because of a wrong keystroke, opened it instead, according to Business Insider. When she opened the Google recruiter email she remembered that her mentor, Stanford professor Eric Roberts, had told her she should meet the founders, Stanford PhD students Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Instead of deleting the email, Mayer asked for an interview.\n\nDespite the happenstance of her applying to Google, Mayer was willing to take a chance on the fledgling startup looking to revolutionize search, even if at the time it had fewer than two dozen employees.\n\n\"When you do something you're not ready to do, that's when you push yourself and when you grow,” she said.\n\nAnother important factor when choosing her job was the people she would work with. One of Mayer’s closest friends was working at Google, and said she was already “really impressed” with Page and Brin.\n\n“I always surrounded myself with the smartest people I could find,” Mayer said. “Because I think that when you're surrounded by smart people, they challenge you and they make you think about things, you know, harder and and just rise to another level.”\n\nAll of those factors made Mayer’s decision easy. Mayer stayed at Google for more than a decade until she was offered the top job at Yahoo. Although Mayer was often criticized during her time there, she still tripled the company’s stock price and navigated it through a sale to Verizon in 2017. Mayer now runs an AI startup called Sunshine, which raised $20 million in 2020 “to simplify and learn from people’s digital address books,” Fortune reported.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Are Microsoft and OpenAI becoming full-on frenemies?",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI!\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have long had a complex, codependent relationship that always makes me want to sing Avril Lavigne (“Why’d ya have to go and make things so complicated?”).\n\nIt all began with Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 and ramped up with its $10 billion commitment in 2023, much of which is in the form of cloud compute purchases instead of cash. In exchange, Microsoft got the right to reuse OpenAI’s models and became a minority holder specifically in the profit-making part of OpenAI’s business which, in turn, is “legally bound to pursue the Nonprofit’s mission.”\n\nThat arrangement gives OpenAI some unusual powers. According to OpenAI, its nonprofit board will determine when the company has “attained AGI,” or artificial general intelligence—the point at which AI finally outperforms humans at \"economically valuable work.\" Once the board decides AGI has been reached, such a system will be “excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft.\" Translation: Once OpenAI achieves its stated mission of reaching AGI, Microsoft will presumably not have access to or be able to profit from OpenAI's AGI-level technology.\n\nIssues around OpenAI’s nonprofit board came to a head when it suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman—and then quickly reinstated him—in November 2023. Before his ouster, Altman said he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were “nowhere near the frenemy territory,” saying the relationship was “really good.”\n\nBut recent developments leave me wondering whether the Big Tech behemoth and the $80 billion startup are becoming full-on frenemies. After all, Nadella was blindsided by Altman’s ouster, learning of it just minutes before the rest of the world. And on a joint episode of the Pivot and On with Kara Swisher podcasts during the Altman drama, he said, “One thing, I’ll be very, very clear, is we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this, ever again.… That’s done.”\n\nThese days, Microsoft is clearly hedging its bets: Less than two months ago, Microsoft announced it was forming a new organization, called Microsoft AI, with Mustafa Suleyman, founder of DeepMind and cofounder of Inflection AI, as its CEO. Microsoft also paid $650 million for the rights to Inflection’s intellectual property. And yesterday, The Information reported that Microsoft is readying a new, massive, state-of-the-art AI model to compete with OpenAI (as well as Google and Anthropic). The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by Suleyman.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI’s Altman appears less focused on the part of the business that benefits Microsoft, and more on the company’s relentless pursuit to reach AGI. Addressing students at Stanford University last week, he honed in on his belief that any cost in support of that mission is justified.\n\n“There is probably some more business-minded person than me at OpenAI somewhere worried about how much we’re spending, but I kinda don’t,” he said. “Whether we burn $500 million a year or $5 billion—or $50 billion a year—I don’t care, I genuinely don’t,” he continued. “As long as we can figure out a way to pay the bills, we’re making AGI. It’s going to be expensive.”\n\nWhether Microsoft will keep investing in OpenAI towards that mega-cost, ill-defined mission remains to be seen. After all, according to an internal email released last week as part of the ongoing U.S. Justice Department antitrust case against Google, Microsoft initially invested in OpenAI in 2019 because it was “very worried” that Google was years ahead in scaling up its AI efforts.\n\n“We are multiple years behind the competition in terms of machine learning scale,” Microsoft’s CTO Kevin Scott wrote in the 2019 email to Nadella and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.\n\nNow, of course, Microsoft is seen as a clear AI leader. Nadella, for his part, appears to be shrewd at playing a multidimensional chess game meant to make sure the company does not fall behind again in AI. At the same time, the OpenAI drama continues: OpenAI is said to be planning the release of an AI-powered search product similar to Perplexity and competitive with Google. But just this morning, The Information reported that OpenAI may postpone an event where its leaders were expected to share updates and show product demonstrations—though it is unclear what the event was about.\n\nSo, are Microsoft and OpenAI full-on frenemies at this point? Or will the Nadella-Altman bromance continue? As recently as January, the two showed a united front in a discussion at Davos about their partnership. But either way, it looks like Microsoft isn’t taking any chances.\n\nWith that, here’s the AI news.\n\nSharon Goldman sharon.goldman@fortune.com\r\n@sharongoldman\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google debuts $499 Pixel 8a as it pushes generative AI to more consumers",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is bringing its generative AI smarts to a broader audience with the debut of its new Pixel 8a smartphone on Tuesday. The phone, which starts at $499, comes with many of the generative AI features found on its pricier Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 devices, including photo and video editing capabilities.\n\nGoogle says the 6.1-inch Pixel 8a will get access to the company’s Gemini generative AI chatbot, as well as generative AI-powered features such as Best Take and Circle to Search. The company also says users will eventually get access to Gemini Nano, a smaller version of the Gemini large language model that runs directly on the Pixel 8a, in a future update.\n\nThe standard version of Gemini requires an internet connection so it can process your requests through Google’s cloud servers. Gemini Nano runs directly on your device, allowing it to perform certain generative AI tasks without accessing the web. Google has debuted its new Pixel 8a smartphone, bringing its generative AI features to a broader audience. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nThe Pixel 8a packs Google's latest Tensor G3 chip, 128GB of storage with an option to upgrade to 256GB, and a new 120-hertz display for smoother gaming and scrolling. There’s also a 64-megapixel wide-angle camera with Super Res Zoom that simulates a telephoto lens and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera.\n\nGoogle previously rolled out a number of the Pixel 8a’s generative AI features alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in October. The standout AI offering is Magic Editor, which allows you to remove unwanted people and objects from images or move them around your photo by simply circling them. I could, for instance, change a photo of myself to make it look like I was dunking a basketball, something I could never do, or edit out a passerby who got in my shot to make it appear as though they were never there.\n\nCircle to Search is a similarly interesting feature that allows you to circle an object in an image and instantly look for it online via Google search. The idea is to make it easier to find products you’ve seen in a photo and purchase them online. You can also highlight text in an image to quickly search for it via Google, as well.\n\nThen there’s Best Take, which is meant for use with group photos. When you take a picture, Best Take will grab a series of images of everyone’s face. If someone blinked in the shot, you can use Best Take to swap out the person’s face with one of the shots in which they didn’t blink. Best Take only changes the person’s face, not their body.\n\nThere’s also Magic Audio Eraser, which helps you cut out background noise in your videos and better isolate the sound of the main subject.\n\nAll of this is part of Google’s effort to turn its generative AI offerings into compelling consumer features that will drive device sales across its Android line of smartphones. The company has also teamed up with Samsung to bring some of the same capabilities to that company’s Galaxy S24 line of phones.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI is seen as the next catalyst to push smartphone sales forward, but there’s still no specific app that is pushing consumers to get out and buy new AI-powered phones. That said, Google is preparing to host its annual Google I/O developer conference on May 14, where it could debut new, truly must-have generative AI features for its Android devices.\n\nGoogle rival Apple (AAPL) is also preparing to reveal a raft of generative AI capabilities for its various products during its WWDC event in June.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google rolled out a new version of its $499 lower-end Pixel smartphone, aiming to entice budget-minded shoppers with an updated screen and artificial intelligence features.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short High-Tech Trading Firms Race to Grab Bond Market Turf Russians Are Coming to Terms With Putin’s War in Ukraine Jack Dorsey Leaves Bluesky Board, Calls X ‘Freedom Technology’\n\nThe Pixel 8a device, which comes a year after the 7a model, adds a faster processor, brighter screen, an option for double the storage and new AI features for the camera, the company said on Tuesday. Google is also cutting the price of its Pixel Tablet by offering a new $399 version that doesn’t come with a charging stand.\n\nThe unveiling — coming within hours of Apple Inc. introducing new iPad models — is an attempt to get more aggressive in phones and tablets. Though Google’s Android software is used by much of the device industry, its own hardware products have made less of a dent.\n\nThe updated Pixel phone looks slightly different than the 7a, with more rounded edges. And it comes in four newly named colors: obsidian, porcelain, bay and aloe. The aluminum frame around the phone has a satin texture, while the back is now made from a grippier matte material instead of glossy plastic.\n\nThe $499 model continues to include 128 gigabytes of storage, but a pricier 256-gigabyte version also is available for the first time. The new screen is 40% brighter and includes a faster, 120-hertz refresh rate, matching screens on many higher-end devices. The Pixel Tablet bundled with a stand still costs $499.\n\nA big focus of the new phones is AI software capabilities. That includes a Circle to Search feature that first debuted on Samsung Electronics Co. devices earlier this year. It lets you seek more information on objects on your screen by circling them your finger, without having to leave the app. There also are AI enhancements for photos and videos.\n\nLike the 7a, the 8a will be manufactured in Vietnam — part of a larger push by electronics makers to build devices outside China.\n\nThe announcements come a week ahead of Google’s I/O event, where it will roll out new AI and Android software features. It’s been an eventful few weeks for the Google division. The company just reshuffled its management to put Pixel head Rick Osterloh in charge of Android and its other software platforms.\n\nRead More: Apple Rivals Retool to Challenge iPhone and Vision Pro\n\nGoogle has shown recent signs of progress, following years of struggling to compete with Apple, Samsung and Chinese brands. Pixel holds 4.6% of the US market, according to research firm IDC, up from 3.6% in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home Chris Dixon’s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto’s Grifty Reputation Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing The State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong Why Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments.\n\nTom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented:\n\n“A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.”\n\nCurrently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the \"size effect\". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs.\n\nSome of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of May 3, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\nA close-up image of a stock market graph displaying the growth of the company's mutual funds.\n\nBest Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\n12. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 69.29%\n\nFirst Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) aims to mirror the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Growth Index. It seeks to achieve similar investment outcomes in terms of both price and yield, excluding fees and expenses. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)’s net expense ratio stands at 0.60% as of December 1, 2023. As of May 2, 2024, the fund’s net assets exceed $1 billion, and its portfolio comprises 187 holdings, excluding cash. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to monitor.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is one of the top holdings of First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC). According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds held stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with a stake worth $1.88 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a popular stock among elite hedge funds.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top Q1 contributors were Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), Shockwave Medical and Spotify. Chipotle’s combination of superior quality and speed of service has created a strong brand affinity, and the company is currently expanding its store count at a growth rate of 8%–10% annually. With each restaurant generating an annual income of around 60% of its original investment cost, the implied payback period is less than two years. Given these attractive economics, we believe a long runway remains for market penetration potential. Next, increased accessibility and convenience have been a strategic priority, leading it to add secondary “make lines” that enable each store to meet increased demand from third-party delivery services and the company’s own digital pickup lanes (“Chipotlanes”). And last, evidence is emerging that the company’s post-COVID training initiatives (“the four pillars of throughput”) are resulting in higher peak-time productivity. Overall, the profit cycle remains nicely in motion, and the stock remains a large CropSM holding.”\n\n11. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 81.23%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 11th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) aims to replicate the performance of S&P 900 Growth Index, which consists of large and mid-cap US stocks known for their growth potential. This ETF focuses on companies expected to experience earnings growth exceeding the market average. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)’s net assets amounted to $16.5 billion as of May 2, 2024. The fund features a portfolio comprising 473 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.04%.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) occupies the largest position in iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)’s portfolio. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was found in 302 hedge fund portfolios, with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust holding the biggest stake in the company, comprising 38.2 million shares worth $14.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds best-in-class platforms and provides services that help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft’s stock appreciated based on excitement surrounding the company’s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI, which will be through both Azure and Microsoft Copilot, the company’s new GenAI personal assistant.”\n\n10. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 82.91%\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is placed 10th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) seeks to replicate the performance of S&P 500(R) Growth Index, which is composed of large-cap US stocks known for their growth potential. The ETF was launched on May 22, 2000. Its net assets amounted to $42.8 billion as of May 2, 2024. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)’s portfolio comprises 228 holdings, along with an expense ratio of 0.18%.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd in the portfolio of iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW). Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database reveals that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of 131 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 134 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.56 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a global consumer electronics and software company that designs and markets mobile communications devices (iPhones), personal computers (Macs), multi-purpose tablets (iPads), and wearables (Apple Watch, AirPods, and Accessories). The company also sells several high-margin consumer services including Advertising, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content and Payment Services. The stock’s underperformance during the quarter was due to fears that the company’s slowing top-line growth and increased competitive threats make the stock’s premium valuation harder to justify.”\n\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 83.73%\n\nVanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) invests in stocks from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Growth Index. Its primary objective is to closely mirror the returns of this index, which is considered a benchmark for overall US growth stock performance. The ETF was established on September 7, 2010. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) features an expense ratio of 0.10% and its portfolio comprises 228 stocks. As of March 31, 2024, VOOG’s net assets came in at $10.3 billion.\n\nSemiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top holdings of Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG). As per Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was found in 173 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 180 in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is one of the largest stakeholders of NVIDIA, with 13.90 million shares worth $6.88 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\n8. iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 92.31%\n\niShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG) seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Growth Index, consisting of US equities with growth traits from both large and mid-cap categories. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. As of May 2, 2024, iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s net assets came exceeded $2 billion. The fund features an expense ratio of 0.04% and a portfolio comprising 392 holdings.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 4th in iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s portfolio. Insider Monkey’s Q4 database found that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was held by 293 smart hedge funds, up from 286 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 41.78 million shares worth $6.34 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.”\n\n7. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 94.88%\n\nFidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) strives to mirror the price and yield performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a weighted index reflecting the market capitalization of stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs, ranking 7th on our list. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) was launched on September 9, 2003. As of March 31, 2024, the fund holds $6.08 billion in portfolio assets, while featuring a portfolio comprising 1,006 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.21%.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top holdings of Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ). Hedge fund ownership in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) increased to 242 funds at the end of December 2023, compared to 234 in the previous quarter. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is one of the key stakeholders of the company, with 7.46 million shares worth $2.6 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\n6. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 100.46%\n\nNuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) ranks 6th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) follows a passive management strategy, investing primarily in large-cap US equity securities displaying growth characteristics and meeting required environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. It aims to replicate the investment outcomes of the TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index, excluding fees and expenses. The fund was launched on December 16, 2016. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) features an expense ratio of 0.26% and holds $1.3 billion in net assets as of May 2, 2024.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the largest holdings of Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was part of 166 hedge fund portfolios at the conclusion of December 2023, up from 163 in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of Alphabet, with a position worth $2.9 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top growth plays on the radar of smart investors.\n\nPalm Valley Capital Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Governments have various irons in the fire for curbing (commandeering?) the power of tech titans, with the European Union rolling out the Digital Markets Act, the Federal Trade Commission suing Amazon for illegally using monopoly power, and the DOJ lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s advertising business going to trial in September.\n\nFurthermore, the dominant technology enterprises are not immune from shooting themselves in the foot. Google’s botched launch of its AI model, Gemini, shows the risk of having too much money. You lose discipline. A Pirate Wires exposé into the firm’s culture revealed that employees went to extreme lengths to intentionally degrade the quality of the AI engine’s output for ideological reasons. Try that as a small business!

        "title": "Ex-Google CEO Schmidt Says He Considered Buying TikTok",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive officer of Google, said he had explored a possible purchase of TikTok but has moved on from the idea of trying to acquire the popular video-sharing app from its Chinese owners.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short High-Tech Trading Firms Race to Grab Bond Market Turf Russians Are Coming to Terms With Putin’s War in Ukraine Jack Dorsey Leaves Bluesky Board, Calls X ‘Freedom Technology’\n\nA new federal law requires TikTok to be sold by its parent, ByteDance Ltd., within a year or face a ban in the US. Schmidt, who ran Alphabet Inc.’s Google for over a decade, confirmed on Tuesday that he at one point considered purchasing the platform — though he added that it’s longer on the table.\n\n“I’m not currently looking at that,” Schmidt said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “I looked at it for a while.” He added that his personal view was that the US would be better off regulating TikTok, rather than banning it or having the app be subject to judicial action.\n\nByteDance is unlikely to sell off the core technology that determines what people see in their feeds, an algorithm that has propelled TikTok to more than 170 million monthly US users. The Chinese government would have to sign off on any such deal, leaving some to speculate that a buyer would seek to acquire the American operations and users — but not the tech that underpins the app.\n\nRecreating the algorithm would be difficult and expensive. Since TikTok rose in popularity during the pandemic for giving users an automatically curated feed of videos, tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet have spent years to try to duplicate the experience, to varying degrees of success.\n\nSchmidt told Bloomberg that he views the app as more akin to television than social media, and that he hoped the US would consider regulating it as such. “You can regulate television by the equivalent of equal time rule,” he said, referring to the federal rule whereby American radio and television broadcast stations must provide equivalent access to competing political candidates. “But somehow we’re not having that conversation,” Schmidt said.\n\nTikTok plans to fight the law in court before considering any kind of separation from its parent company, people familiar with the matter have said. Supporters of the bill say TikTok’s ties to China through its parent company open the possibility that China’s government would access US users’ data or influence what shows up on their feeds – an assertion that TikTok and official in Beijing have consistently refuted.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home Chris Dixon’s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto’s Grifty Reputation Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing The State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong Why Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "12 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best investments for beginners in 2024. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024.\n\nWith the first quarter of 2024 now concluded, the stock market has evolved. Continuing trends from Q4 2023, the period witnessed the sustained growth of artificial intelligence and technology stocks, with investors remaining optimistic about AI's potential across consumer and business applications, alongside expectations of multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year. However, as we move into the second quarter of the year, investor sentiment has shifted from anticipating a strong economic environment to reassessing strategies for allocating significant funds into the stock market.\n\nIn April, U.S. job growth decelerated more than anticipated, with the annual wage increase dipping below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, according to the Labor Department's latest employment report released on April 3. The unemployment rate also rose slightly to 3.9% from March's 3.8%, attributed to a growing labor supply. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 175,000 jobs last month, marking the lowest increase in six months, with revisions revealing 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than initially reported. Despite these figures, the jobless rate persisted below 4% for the 27th consecutive month.\n\nThe signs of a cooling labor market sparked optimism that the U.S. central bank could orchestrate a \"soft landing\" for the economy, dispelling concerns of stagflation, which had been fueled by reports of subdued economic growth and elevated inflation in the first quarter. In that regard, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her readiness to raise the policy rate if progress stalls or reverses, while expressing confidence that inflation will continue to decline even as the central bank maintains its benchmark interest rate at current levels:\n\n\"My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed.\"\n\nAlthough inflation has decreased from its peak in mid-2022, it remains significantly above the central bank's target range. Most reports this year have indicated an annual inflation rate of around 3%, with the Fed's preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, recently standing at 2.8%. Rising prices have led to upward pressure on wages, contributing to an inflationary environment that has prevented the Fed from taking aggressive steps to cut interest rates, despite market expectations suggesting otherwise.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're a beginner in the world of investments and finance, diving right in can seem daunting with everything mentioned above. However, there are strategies to simplify the process and increase your chances of success. One approach is to focus on established, well-known companies with strong financial foundations. These household names often offer more stability and growth potential over time. By avoiding riskier investments and sticking to proven businesses, beginners can build a solid foundation for their investment journey and increase their likelihood of early success in the stock market. In that regard, some of the best stocks to invest in 2024 for beginners include the likes of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), among others listed below. 12 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024\n\nSource:unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this list, we utilized a stock screener to identify stable companies demonstrating at least low to mid-teens revenue growth. Subsequently, we sorted these companies by market capitalization to prioritize the largest ones. Our selection criteria focused on stocks suitable for beginners, considering both revenue growth and hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The resulting list is arranged in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 18.17%\n\nBased in New York, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) operates globally across multiple sectors, including Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management.\n\nOn March 13, RBC Capital analysts reaffirmed an Outperform rating on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a price target of $185.\n\nInsider Monkey’s analysis of 933 hedge fund portfolios for their fourth-quarter 2023 holdings revealed that 103 had positions in the bank. Notably, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), valued at $2 billion.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers said the following about JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“PNC Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.”\n\nMuch like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) ranks as one of the best investments for beginners.\n\n11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 11.75%\n\nBased in California, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a versatile software company known for its wide range of products and solutions that empower individuals, teams, and enterprises to create, publish, and promote content. Renowned among content creators, students, professionals, and consumers, Adobe Inc.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management emerged as the largest hedge fund shareholder, possessing 31.1 million shares valued at $3.2 billion.\n\nWedgewood Partners, an investment management company, made the following comments about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Company began shipping chips that were fabricated using its industry-leading “N3” node. Nearly all of the Company’s N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity.”\n\n9.

(NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 117\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 19.46%\n\nHeadquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands as a leading American multinational corporation specializing in managed healthcare and insurance services.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc., (META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts.

        "title": "Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory",
        "content": "Tech conglomerate Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to ride a wave of positive momentum, both in the long and short term.\n\nIn the long term, the significant growth and profitability of the Cloud segment shows promising signs to catch up to larger rivals, along with the company's leading position in search allowing it to capitalize on new developments from the investments made into generative artificial intelligence.\n\nIn the short term, a series of potential catalysts include the upcoming company events to showcase AI capabilities (Google I/O), potential for Gemini image relaunch that could help with sentiment on Google's AI capabilities, the revenue potential from Shorts monetization and the ongoing operating model optimization and reprioritization.\n\nThis analysis will delve into the long-term and short-term catalysts that could potentially fuel Alphabet's momentum, as well as my forward views on these factors. But first and foremost, let's dive into the company's outstanding performance recorded in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings update\n\nRevenue overview Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet significantly exceeded expectations, surpassing consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. According to Factset data, the company exceeded revenue estimates by approximately $1 billion. The company achieved $80.50 billion in sales, representing a significant 15.40% year-over-year increase. The figure above illustrates this revenue growth was driven by notable advancements in YouTube ads (up 20.90% year over year), Google Search (up 14.40%) and Google Cloud (up 28.40%).\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet outperformed consensus expectations in terms of profitability, with an operating margin of 31.60% (a 667 basis point increase from a year ago). More notably, its Google cloud operating margins took a wild upturn delivering a margin of 9.40% (up 683 basis points). The company's operating income for the quarter amounted to $25.50 billion, reflecting a substantial 32% increase compared to the same period in 2023. On that note, the expansion in profitability can be attributed to better operating leverage as the higher top line was met with flattish operating costs. Alphabet's earnings per share performance showed remarkable growth as it reported a substantial rise in net income to $23.70 billion (up 57.20%), equating to $1.89 (versus $1.17 last year) diluted net income per share surpassing consensus estimates by a wide margin.\n\nNet income overview Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's capital return potential\n\nA key upside of owning Alphabet lies in its ability to provide significant returns to shareholders through its substantial available free cash flow. In the first quarter alone, it generated free cash flow of $16.80 billion (down 2.20% year over year). Capitalizing on this substantial free cash flow, the management made a historic announcement of a 20 cents cash dividend, scheduled to be paid on June 17. Moreover, the cash dividend is in addition to Alphabet's declaration of a $70 billion share repurchase program, which will further contribute to returning substantial amounts of cash to shareholders. Even before this announcement, Alphabet had been returning capital to its shareholder evident from its repurchase of $15.70 billion worth of its own shares in the first quarter of 2024 alone resulting in an impressive 93% cash flow return percentage.\n\nIn light of the introduction of both the dividend and share repurchase programs, I expect Alphabet to attract a growing number of investors, consequently driving its value upward in the medium to long term.\n\nLong-term catalyst one: Cloud business\n\nKnown for its pioneering search engine, Alphabet has evolved into a multi-faceted entity encompassing a vast array of products and services spanning from cloud computing and advertising to hardware and artificial intelligence. Amidst this dynamic landscape, the company has shown an excellent trajectory of growth and innovation (evident by its exceptional revenue growth record [compound annual growth rate of 18.50% from 2017 to 2023]). With this, Alphabet derives a lion's share of its revenue from its advertising segment, but with the increasing share of the cloud segment in Google's revenue, it is bringing some much-needed diversity to the revenue mix.\n\nRevenue mix 2017 versus 2023 Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nAlthough the Google Cloud segment is consistently increasing its revenue share (Cloud revenues has grown at a CAGR of 41.90% from 2017 to 2023) while also being consistently profitable, it still lags behind larger rivals. According to CRN.com, Google Cloud generated almost three times less than Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud businesses. But this segment is showing significant promise, with it now being consistently profitable and continuing to grow at a very healthy rate (recorded positive operation margin in 2023 of 5.20% [9.4% in first-quarter 2024]), but is still low compared to Amazon at 26% and Microsoft at 44%. As the segment expands in the long term, Google Cloud's operating margin is to improve as well. However, I also expect Alphabet will continue to make significant investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities arising from the shift toward cloud-based solutions. Consequently, the margins are expected to remain below those of competitors like Amazon and Microsoft, despite steady improvements.\n\nGoogle Cloud business operating performance (2018 to 2023) Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\n\nGiven the widespread shift to cloud-based solutions, I am optimistic about the market's size and rapid growth, enabling all three players (Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet) to achieve success over the next few years. Google, with its strategic dedication, technological expertise and financial capabilities, is well positioned to continue gaining market share. Nonetheless, capitalizing on the growing market will involve substantial investment, potentially causing Google Cloud's profitability to lag behind that of its peers.\n\nCloud Infrastructure market share as of fourth-quarter 2023 Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: Statista\n\nLong-term catalyst two: Generative AI and large language models\n\nThe generative AI space as a whole has immense potential for revolutionizing various industries from entertainment to health care and beyond with its applications being vast and continually expanding. However, several concerns have been raised with regard to the potential impact on Alphabet's leading position in search with the latest developments in the space by competitors like Microsoft (OpenAI), as gen AI technologies usher in the development of more sophisticated and interactive consumer tools, potentially challenging its standing. However, I believe Alphabet's strong position in both the gen AI and search spaces will be unchanged due to the promising development of products.\n\nAlphabet has continued to dedicate significant resources to its investments in gen AI and has done so for several years. I expect its abilities to expand as it continues to invest heavily over the next few years as well. Alphabet has its own products, like Bard, that I expect to evolve and improve due to ongoing investments that will allow the company to maintain its strong position in search and the broader digital advertising market.\n\nI believe Google is way ahead in the AI race with its leading position stemming from three main factors. First, its extensive volume of research is unparalleled, with 183 papers accepted in 2023 alone, nearly three times more than its closest competitor. Second, Google possesses unparalleled access to vast amounts of data thanks to its 16 services boasting over half a billion daily active users. Finally, Google's robust infrastructure enables it to effectively train and deploy AI models to a wide audience, leveraging its immense reach.\n\nRecently, Alphabet's Gemini Pro 1.5 its most advanced large language model was released to the general public, with a free tier limited to 50 requests a day. The Gemini Pro 1.5 is a multimodal system meaning it is able to process image, audio and video inputs, in addition to text inputs (OpenAI's latest version of GPT-4 is currently only able to process text and image inputs).\n\nShort-term catalysts\n\nApart from the aforementioned long-term catalysts, my optimistic outlook on the company in the short term is derived from several other catalysts, including:\n\nGoogle I/O Event Scheduled for May 14, this annual event is anticipated to introduce new AI integrations across various Google products such as Search, Maps, Android, Cloud and Google Workspace.\n\nGemini image generation relaunch Expected to relaunch in the second quarter, Google is set to introduce an upgraded version of Gemini image generation. This relaunch may involve a gradual rollout, initially granting access to developers or beta testers for human oversight and feedback. The focus may initially target specific use cases like generating product mockups and illustrations for advertisers, which may boost investor sentiment on Gemini.\n\nShorts monetization and YouTube revenue Short-form videos are driving engagement and revenue growth on social media platforms, including YouTube. As Shorts monetization catches up in 2024, we anticipate accelerating revenue growth on YouTube, which could positively impact Alphabet's overall revenue growth trajectory.\n\nOperating model optimization and reprioritization- Over the past few years, management has placed significant emphasis on the development of innovative new features, all while maintaining a firm grip on cost control. This strategic approach clearly indicates management's strong commitment to achieving a more sustainable operating model that will enhance profitability. Recently, Alphabet has outlined its plans to improve expense efficiency by 2024, which may involve restructuring efforts aimed at reducing both headcount and operational expenses, thereby driving margin expansion. An internal memo from Alphabet's CEO has also informed employees to anticipate further layoffs in 2024, following the previous layoffs in the ad sales unit. These actions underscore the company's ongoing efforts to reassess priorities and invest in its most critical areas.\n\nThoughts on valuation\n\nUsing a discounted cash flow model to assess Alphabet's value over a five-year growth period, a fair price of around $188 per share is projected, representing a roughly 10% increase from current levels on the basis cash flows are anticipated to grow from a forecasted $70 billion in 2024 to $130.50 billion by 2028, with a compounded annual growth rate of 13.30%. These estimates seem plausible given the positive growth drivers identified previously, suggesting potential upside in the company's growth trajectory. As Alphabet solidifies its core businesses and continues to innovate with AI tools to reinforce its position in search, there is room for significant upside beyond investor expectations. Extending the growth horizon to 10 years, a fair value of approximately $241 per share is projected, marking a roughly 40% increase from current levels, further highlighting Alphabet's growth potential.\n\nDespite various bearish arguments against Alphabet, there are no evident flaws or indications of these concerns in its financials. Throughout its history, the company has been a driving force of innovation and now, as a formidable and influential entity, it can innovate on a grander scale with substantial upfront investments while also generously rewarding shareholders. While many large tech companies appear to be thriving presently, the crucial aspect is their trajectory over the next five to 10 years. Given Google's immense scale, I am confident it will only continue to ascend from its current position.\n\nDiscounted cash flow analysis five-year growth exit Unveiling Long and Short-Term Catalysts for Alphabet's Growth Trajectory\n\nSource: valueinvesting.io\n\nWrapping up\n\nIn conclusion, Alphabet stands poised to capitalize on a multitude of catalysts both in the long and short term. The company's robust growth trajectory in the cloud segment, coupled with its pioneering advancements in generative AI, positions it favorably to maintain and expand its market dominance. Short-term catalysts, including upcoming events showcasing AI capabilities and product relaunches, add further momentum to Alphabet's growth story. With a strategic focus on operational efficiency and innovation, Alphabet is primed to deliver significant upside potential for investors in the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Andreessen Horowitz partner says Google is an ‘amazing example’ of employing people in ‘BS jobs’: ‘Half the white-collar staff probably does no real work’",
        "content": "Google might be among corporate America's favorite success stories, but some people aren't convinced Big Tech is operating as efficiently as it could be. Indeed, according to one Silicon Valley insider, half the white collar workers at the tech behemoth aren't even doing \"real work.\"\n\nThe idea that Big Tech overhires talent to have them on hand for future projects—and ensure they stay out of the hands of rivals—isn't a new one.\n\nLast year individuals told Fortune they had been \"talent penned\": hired by technology companies on six-figure salaries \"to do nothing\" except complete a 10-minute task every now and again. The sources Fortune spoke to said some hires use their weekdays to learn how to scuba dive, while managers told off the candidates for asking too many questions.\n\nAnd it seems some companies are also retaining their bloated headcount with people who don't actually help drive the company forward—in fact in some cases, their presence actually holds back innovation.\n\nThat's according to David Ulevitch, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, who said there a \"bunch of people\" in large corporations working \"BS jobs.\"\n\nGoogle is an \"amazing example\" of such a company, he told  Emily Sundberg's 'Feed Me' substack newsletter.\n\n\"Anyone who works in a 10,000+ person or larger white-collar job company knows that a bunch of the people can probably be let go tomorrow and the company wouldn’t really feel the difference, maybe it’d even improve with less people inserting themselves into things,\" began the partner at the VC giant also known as a16z, which has backed the likes of airbnb, Facebook, Instagram and Roblox.\n\nAnother issue with \"BS jobs\" is that it detracts from shareholder returns, he explained: \"Those people aren't just being useless (and being coddled to think useless jobs actually matter—they don’t), but they are also taking money away from the rest of the workforce's retirement programs.\n\n\"Google is an amazing example of this. I don’t think it’s crazy to believe that half the white-collar staff at Google probably does no real work,\" he continued. \"The company has spent billions and billions of dollars per year on projects that go nowhere for over a decade, and all that money could have been returned to shareholders who have retirement accounts. So real people actually lose out when BS jobs exist.\"\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoggle's projects\n\nGoogle may certainly beg to differ. In December the Alphabet-owned company integrated its quickly released Bard chatbot into a new service named Gemini, an AI model trained to behave in human-like ways. The rollout will unfold in phases, with less sophisticated versions of Gemini called “Nano” and “Pro” being immediately incorporated into Google’s AI-powered chatbot Bard and its Pixel 8 Pro smartphone.\n\nFurther launches of Gemini haven't come off without a hitch—its AI image tool attracted controversy and ridicule after it created misleading images of the race of historical figures.\n\nBut the team at Google have also had some wins. In January a DeepMind product was able to solve difficult geometry proofs used to test high school students in the International Mathematical Olympiad, while utilization of Gemini within Google's all-important search engine is ongoing.\n\nAnd while Ulevitch, who leads Andreessen Horowitz's American Dynamism practice, is unimpressed with some of Google's projects—or his perceived lack thereof given the funding allocated—Wall Street certainly doesn't seem to mind. Shares in Google parent Alphabet are up almost 22% for the year to date, and up 57% over the past 12 months at the time of writing.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment, though Ulevitch told Business Insider: \"My only comment is that I think it ranks as one of the least controversial things I've ever said.\"\n\nReturn to making\n\nOne of the fallouts of Ulevitch's \"BS jobs\" concern is that America is increasingly losing the skills needed to build products and parts for its own industrial future.\n\nInstead, he adds, \"we have outsourced much of their work overseas, increasingly to countries we are getting less and less friendly with (China) but also because we've just made those jobs seem less desirable.\"\n\nBut where this reliance on economic rivals could go sour—an issue which also has JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon worried—there are also opportunities for start-ups to fill that gap, Ulevitch added.\n\nIt may be welcome news, then, that enrollment in vocational-focused community colleges rose 16% last year to its highest level since the National Student Clearinghouse began tracking this data in 2018, as students increasingly look to tools and the trades for a fulfilling career.\n\nIn fact the data revealed a 23% surge in students studying construction trades in 2023 compared to 2022, as well as a 7% increase in HVAC and vehicle maintenance and repair programs.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What's a glitzy investing conference without a little \"Magnificent Seven\" banter?\n\n\"The risk is simple — those stocks don't do well,\" Avenue Capital Group founder and CEO Marc Lasry told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday.\n\nLasry was answering a question about the risk of overcrowding into tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — aka the Magnificent Seven.\n\n\"What has happened is when people are nervous, they invest in things that they know really well and they believe are going to be around,\" Lasry added. \"But I don't know what happens in the next year. I do know on the credit side, you've got all these opportunities.\" Apollo CEO Marc Rowan (right) weighs in on markets and the Mag Seven with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the Milken conference. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe former co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, Lasry has been investing in credit markets for more than four decades, giving him a reported net worth of $1.9 billion.\n\nSo suffice it to say, Lasry has seen a few investing cycles and market crazes.\n\nAnd the Magnificent Seven could be viewed as a craze.\n\nAltogether, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 37% of the S&P 500's 10.2% gain in the first quarter, according to data from S&P Global Indices. In 2023, the cohort constituted roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500's advance.\n\nThe optimism in the group reflects profit enthusiasm on everything from Nvidia's AI chips to Microsoft's Copilot productivity tool.\n\nBut with investors now more closely scrutinizing the Magnificent Seven amid higher interest rates, shares have slowed their roll.\n\nAs Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan explained, \"I'm not in the stock-picking business. But very few people come in every day and try to buy 45 or 50 P/E stocks. It's just not what we do.\" (Disclosure: Apollo Global Management is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.)\n\n\"I look at the broader trend. We used to have 8,000 public companies. We now have 4,000 public companies,\" he added. \"People think most of the action is in public markets. 80% of companies over a hundred million [in] revenue and 80% of employment is in private companies.\"\n\nSome top traders shared their views on how to trade the Magnificent Seven stocks on a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast. You can tune in below.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. He is also the host of the \"Opening Bid\" podcast. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet,  Netflix, Amazon, ServiceNow and Boston Scientific",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – May 7, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Netflix Inc. NFLX, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, ServiceNow Inc. NOW and Boston Scientific Corp. BSX.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nGolden Opportunity to Enter U.S. Stock Markets\n\nThe 15-month bull run of U.S. stock markets suffered a surprise setback in April. The Dow plunged 5%, marking its worst monthly performance since September 2022. The S&P 500 slid 4.2% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.4%. All three major stock indexes terminated a five-month winning streak. April is historically known as being favorable to Wall Street investors.\n\nWe believe April's meltdown is nothing but a bull market correction and this time a welcome one. After a disappointing month, May opens a golden opportunity to enter the equity market for those investors suffering from the FOMO (fear of missing out) syndrome. Finally, recently released economic data boosted market participants’ confidence in equities.\n\nResilient Labor Market Shows Signs of Softness\n\nThe Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, missing the consensus estimate of 200,000. Job additions in March were revised upward by 12,000 while those of February were revised downward by 34,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate increased to 3.9% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 3.8%. April marked the highest level since January 2022. Moreover, real unemployment rate (including discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons) edged up to 7.4%, its highest level since November 2021. The labor force participation rate was unchanged at 62.7% in April.\n\nMonth over month, the average hourly earnings rate dropped to 0.2% in April, compared with the consensus estimate and March’s data of 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 3.9% in April, below the consensus estimate of 4%. The average workweek decreased to 34.3.\n\nU.S. Economy is Cooling\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP grew at a 1.6% annualized rate in first-quarter 2024, well below the consensus estimate of 2.5%. Moreover, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that both manufacturing and services PMIs (purchasing managers’ index) contracted in April.\n\nThe manufacturing PMI for April came in at 49.2% and that of services PMI was 49.4%. Any reading below 50% indicates contraction in activities. The manufacturing PMI expanded in March after 16 consecutive months of contraction. It again contracted in April. The services PMI contracted in April after 15 successive months of expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpectations of Interest Rate Cut Rise\n\nFollowing the release of the April’s nonfarm payrolls, the CME FedWatch shows a 67.4% probability that the central bank will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting. The interest rate futures tool also shows a massive 91.5% probability that the Fed will cut rate by 50 basis points. Notably, the Fed fund rate currently stays within the range of 5.25-5.5% since July 2023.\n\nOn May 1, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell categorically denied the resumption of the interest rate hike regime in his post-FOMC meeting statement. Moreover, the FOMC voted to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank’s gigantic balance sheet. The Fed started this program in June 2022, which was known as “quantitative tightening.” Its latest decision could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy.\n\nA Goldilocks Environment?\n\nA Goldilocks scenario is characterized as continuous economic growth but not as much a rapid pace to inflate the aggregate price level to such an extent that the central bank is compelled to tighten monetary policies.\n\nThe U.S. economy has cooled but is growing at a pace similar to that of the pre-pandemic level. The labor market shown the signs of crack but not at an alarming pace. The peak inflation rate is far behind us. Finally, there are no signs of any near-term recession. Consequently, this is a golden opportunity to enter U.S. stock markets.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have strong growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.\n\nFurther, stock prices of these companies have double-digit upside potential in the near-term. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s first-quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive. Also, the strength in YouTube favored the stock. Notably, a robust cloud division remains the key catalyst for GOOGL.\n\nExpanding data centers will continue to bolster GOOGL’s presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. GOOGL’s deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.1% and 30.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.5% over the last seven days. The average price targetrepresents an increase of 12.6% from the last closing price of $167.24.\n\nNetflix Inc. added 9.33 million paid subscribers globally in first-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 52.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days. The average price targetrepresents an increase of 13.6% from the last closing price of $579.34.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN in gaining momentum among customers.\n\nAMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 56.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 16% from the last closing price of $186.21.\n\nServiceNow Inc. has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. NOW had 1933 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value at the end of the first quarter. NOW had eight deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV, and four deals of more than $10 million.\n\nNOW closed 59 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. The number of customers contributing more than $20 million or more grew 50% year over year. Generative AI deals continued to gain traction with record-breaking net new ACV for Pro Plus, making it the fastest-selling product in NOW’s history.\n\nZacks Rank #2 ServiceNow has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.3% and 25.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $716.65.\n\nBoston Scientific Corp. is seeing strength across target markets despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation. Strong worldwide demand for BSX’s GI and pulmonary treatment options, traction in Europe for its next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers.\n\nThe Pain and Brain franchisees of BSX are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on the strong execution of core growth strategies. The EP arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Boston Scientific has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. The average price targetrepresents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $72.85.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Alphabet stock (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) surged over 10% after its Q1 announcement, marking a substantial post-earnings rally. Despite Alphabet being already one of my largest positions, its most recent report further solidified my confidence in the stock. With the company effortlessly beating Wall Street’s estimates and posting double-digit growth across the board, shares continue to appear cheap, even after reaching new all-time highs. Consequently, I remain bullish on Alphabet stock.\n\nQ1 Results: Effortless Beat, Double-Digit Growth Persists\n\nAlphabet’s Q1 numbers marked an effortless beat against Wall Street’s estimates, with the California-based tech giant posting double-digit growth across the board. Revenues soared to $80.5 billion, as you can see in the image below, topping consensus estimates by a wide margin of $1.84 billion. The 15% revenue growth also marked a significant acceleration from the previous year’s growth of 3%. Further, EPS came in at $1.89, exceeding Street estimates by a significant margin of $0.38. Let’s take a deeper look. Source: Alphabet’s Q1-2024 Earnings Report\n\nSearch, YouTube Enjoy AI-Backed Advertising Growth Momentum\n\nAlphabet’s impressive growth in Q1 was primarily fueled by the durable momentum of its AI-powered advertising solutions, driving revenues for both Google Search and YouTube. Consider the company’s use of AI in smart bidding, for instance. It predicts future ad conversions, enabling businesses to swiftly adapt to shifting demand dynamics.\n\nMoreover, products like Broad Match leverage large language models to match ads to relevant searches and thus enable advertisers to respond to what millions of people are searching for. In other words, by utilizing Alphabet’s AI solutions, businesses can now find users at speed and scale and drive improving ROI, which naturally translates to growing advertising dollars for the company. Evidently, Google Search revenues grew by 14% to $46.2 billion, while YouTube Ads revenues grew by 21% to $8.1 billion.\n\nThe exciting part is that most of Alphabet’s AI solutions are only starting to roll out. We are way too early in the company’s roadmap, meaning the best is yet to come. Take P-Max, for instance, which debuted in Gemini this past February. It’s revolutionizing the creation of text and image assets, enabling businesses to promptly fulfill P-Max asset requirements.\n\nThe company claims that advertisers leveraging P-Max asset generation are 63% more likely to launch a campaign with outstanding ad strength. However, this functionality is currently exclusive to the U.S. Consequently, it’s reasonable to anticipate a prolonged surge in advertiser adoption as Alphabet progressively introduces its AI solutions worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle Cloud Sees Margin Expansion, Boosts Profits\n\nGoogle Cloud also contributed significantly to Alphebet’s revenue growth. However, it also had a notable contribution to the company’s profitability, with the division undergoing a significant margin expansion.\n\nIn particular, not only did Google Cloud revenues grow by a notable 28% to $9.6 billion, but the division’s operating margin expanded from 2.6% last year to 9.4%. It’s very encouraging to see that Q1 was Google Cloud’s fifth consecutive quarter with a positive operating profit margin.\n\nIn fact, a margin expansion in Google Cloud has taken place every quarter during this five-quarter period, notably boosting Alphebet’s overall margins and EPS growth. To illustrate, in Q1, the company’s operating margin jumped to 32%, up from 25% in the previous year, which, combined with growing revenues and share repurchases, resulted in EPS skyrocketing from 62% to $1.89.\n\nAlphabet Stock Remains Cheap after the Earnings Rally\n\nFollowing such a strong Q1 report, Alphabet shares soared to a new all-time high. Yet, I continue to find the stock quite attractively priced compared to its future growth prospects. Following an excellent start to the year, consensus estimates for Alphabet’s full-year EPS stand at $7.51, which implies a year-over-year increase of nearly 30%. Note that this comes after FY2023’s EPS growth of 27.3%. Despite such lavish growth figures, shares trade close to 22.2x this year’s projected EPS.\n\nEven if Alphabet’s growth were to slow considerably from its current levels, the stock’s valuation still looks rather cheap, especially given Alphabet’s moat and leading position in the AI race. It’s also possible that Wall Street underestimates Alphabet’s growth growth prospects, which could imply that shares are even cheaper than they actually appear. Given the powerful combination of revenue growth and a strong margin expansion in Google Cloud, this is not a far-fetched assumption.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLooking at Wall Street’s view on the stock, Alphabet features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 31 Buys and seven Holds assigned in the past three months. At $189.79, the average Alphabet stock price prediction implies 12.9% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re unsure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell GOOGL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Mark Kelley from Stifel Nicolaus, featuring an average return of 32.12% per rating and a 95% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nTo sum up, Alphabet’s stellar Q1 results further strengthened my conviction in the tech giant’s prospects. With robust revenue growth driven by AI-powered advertising solutions and significant margin expansion in Google Cloud, Alphabet continues to surpass market expectations.\n\nIn fact, with the market likely still not fully pricing in the added benefit of AI to the company’s results, I believe the stock price remains at rather compelling levels despite the double-digit post-earnings rally. Hence, I will keep adding to my position at current levels.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "15 Highest Paying Countries for English Teachers",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 highest paying countries for English teachers. We have also discussed the global importance of the English language. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for English Teachers.\n\nEnglish, as the global lingua franca, is the foremost communication tool worldwide, holding its ground against many other languages. Recent research by the British Council indicates that English is projected to maintain its dominance for the foreseeable future. The language's ubiquity extends beyond mere communication; it serves as a gateway to educational, professional, and social opportunities on a global scale.\n\nDespite advancements in technology and the rise of automation, the role of English teachers remains pivotal in facilitating language learning. Moreover, statistics from Pearson's English Skills Report indicate a direct correlation between English proficiency and earning potential, with 93% of respondents acknowledging its impact on salaries. Those with advanced English skills earn substantially higher salaries than their less proficient counterparts. All of these factors combined solidify the importance and demand of learning English. The demand has become so high that one can even teach the language without necessarily having a degree. To read more about that, see the Best Countries to Teach English Without a Degree.\n\nIn addition, beyond English speaking countries, English proficiency has aso become of key importance in countries like Saudi Arabia particularly as the country strives to achieve its Vision 2030 objectives. With a major portion of the workforce operating in English-speaking environments, the language has become indispensable for job opportunities and career advancement. However, Saudi Arabia currently ranks low on the EF Proficiency Index which indicates an urgent need for improvement in English language education. Despite widespread recognition of the importance of English, many employees feel inadequately prepared for the workplace due to limited language skills acquired during formal education. Moreover, there is a huge gap between the demand for language training and its availability in the corporate sector, with only 44% of companies offering such programs. To read more countries where English language teaching has been highly demanded, see countries with high demand for English teachers.\n\nThe importance of the English language has been realized globally and therefore, its demand continues to grow, translating into different initiatives and projects. For example, to promote English language proficiency in Mongolia, the UK has pledged significant support. With a £10 million ($12.51 million) allocation over three years, the UK aims to enhance the implementation of English language programs across Mongolian schools. This initiative goes hand in hand with the establishment of English as the primary foreign language in secondary schools under the Education Law of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making consistent efforts towards English language learning through its innovative features, particularly the introduction of an AI-powered tool called \"speaking practice\" on its Search platform. This tool is currently in the testing phase but it aims to enhance users' English speaking skills by providing interactive experiences focused on everyday scenarios. This initiative targets users in several countries such as India, as part of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Search Labs program, demonstrating its global outreach and impact.\n\nAccessible through Google Search Labs, the \"speaking practice\" feature enables users to engage in simulated conversations and thus, helps them practice using new words in context and improve their conversational English. While not a comprehensive language learning course, this tool promotes a dynamic learning experience, akin to real-life interactions. By listening to users' speech, understanding their intent, and generating natural-sounding responses, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI is facilitating effective language practice.\n\nIt is also true that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s commitment to language learning is not new, with previous launches such as the pronunciation tool introduced in 2019. By offering engaging language learning tools, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) aims to compete with established language learning platforms while providing accessible and effective resources for English learners worldwide.\n\nOn the other hand, Rosetta Stone Inc (NYSE:RST) has an unparalleled contribution to English learning, particularly for English language learners (ELLs), through its comprehensive curriculum and immersive activities. Lynn Public Schools, recognizing the importance of language skills for its diverse student body, has recently partnered with Rosetta Stone Inc (NYSE:RST) to enhance language proficiency and bridge equity gaps.\n\nOne key contribution of Rosetta Stone Inc (NYSE:RST) is its ability to break down language barriers effectively. With scaffolded lessons and interactive activities, ELLs can overcome obstacles in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. The platform's structured immersion method mirrors natural language acquisition and hence, promotes intuitive learning through real-world contexts.\n\nMoreover, Rosetta Stone Inc (NYSE:RST) offers options catering to diverse learning needs and preferences. With access to 25 languages, learners can personalize their language learning journey. Additionally, the platform prioritizes the development of strong verbal skills which empowers students to communicate fluently through targeted speaking practice and immediate feedback. 15 Highest Paying Countries for English Teachers\n\nEiko Tsuchiya/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the highest paying countries for English teachers, we identified the countries with the highest demand for English teachers and then made a list for 25 countries with the average salaries for English teachers. Of those 25, the 15 with the highest average salaries were selected and have been ranked. We acquired the data for average salaries of English teachers for each country from ERI Economic Research Institute. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Sweden\n\nAverage Salary: $43,782\n\nSweden is among Scandinavian countries known for its strong English proficiency. With 89% of its population, roughly 9,236,000 people, fluent in English as a second language, Sweden ranks seventh in the EU and twenty-seventh globally for non-native English speakers. Given the importance Swedes associate with the language, it is one of the highest paying countries for English teachers in Europe.\n\n14.

        "title": "Is Alphabet (GOOGL) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this internet search leader is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 30.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.7%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.4%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 11.8% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest average salaries in Europe. We have also discussed why Americans find Europe attractive for relocation. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe.\n\nEurope has become a compelling destination for Americans that looking for relocation owing to obvious factors like quality of life, affordable housing, political stability, and remote work opportunities. However, moving to Europe's expensive cities can be a financial challenge, but for many Americans, the investment in quality of life pays off. In cities like Vienna, where childcare costs are significantly lower than in the US, families find raising children more manageable. While rent in European cities like Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Berlin can be steep, residents can not neglect the amazing benefits these regions have to offer.\n\nMoreover, Portugal is known to be one of the countries with high salary and low cost of living in Europe. On the other hand, Luxembourg is the country with the highest minimum wage in Europe, but it is still an expensive country to relocate to. To read about jobs and saalries in Europe, see the Most in Demand Jobs in Europe.\n\nSpeaking of minimum wages, in 2024, minimum wages across Europe vary significantly. Among the 27 EU member states, 22 have established a national minimum wage. However, Denmark, Italy, Austria, Finland, and Sweden do not enforce one. The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, including Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland, also lack a national minimum wage policy. Cyprus recently introduced a minimum wage, while eight out of ten candidate and potential candidate countries have established their own. To read more about minimum wages, see the 20 Countries with the Highest Minimum Wage in the World.\n\nDespite the establishment of minimum wages across the continent, the minimum wage disparity is stark, ranging from €477 ($481)  in Bulgaria to €2,571 ($2770)  in Luxembourg on a gross monthly basis. Notably, the minimum wage is above €2,000 ($2154) in Luxembourg, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany. Conversely, in 14 out of 22 EU member states with a minimum wage, it falls below €1,000 ($1077) per month. Adjusting for purchasing power standard (PPS) reveals a narrower range, with minimum wages ranging from €542 ($584) in Albania to €1,883 ($2028) in Germany.\n\nThe adequacy of minimum wages is a pressing concern, with ratios to median wages falling below 50% in ten EU countries in 2022. The EU's new directive aims to address this by setting a framework for regular revisions to ensure adequacy and protect the standard of living for low-paid workers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of adequacy, it is also interesting to note that more women are applying for jobs in Europe than in North America, with 52% of job applicants in the EMEA region being women, compared to 50% in North America, according to a March 2024 report from iCIMS. One factor contributing to the higher volume of female job applicants in Western Europe is the region's progressive stance on workplace gender balance. European employers have been actively implementing initiatives to close gender gaps, such as equal parental leave policies and accessible childcare services. These efforts have encouraged more women to seek employment opportunities, reflecting a cultural shift towards gender equality in the workforce.\n\nBefore getting into our list of the countries with the highest average salaries in Europe, let’s look at the recent developments observed by multinationals in Europe to truly understand the attractiveness of Europe for salaries and jobs in general.\n\nIn 2024, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is further expanding its European operations by investing over €700 million ($754.1 million) in robotics and AI-powered technologies for its fulfillment centers (FCs). With plans to introduce 120 new pieces of automation technology,  Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to revolutionize its European network. By the end of the year, the company's Innovation Lab, established in 2017, is set to oversee the installation of more than 1,000 new robotics systems to enhance efficiency and customer experience.\n\nThese cutting-edge technologies, including item sorters and automated guide vehicles, not only improve operational capabilities but also create new job opportunities.  Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported that these innovations had enhanced over 50,000 jobs in its FCs, providing employees with upskilling opportunities and a safer working environment. Furthermore,  Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Innovation Lab serves as a training center for robotics operators and a testing ground for start-ups receiving funding through the Amazon Industrial Innovation fund.\n\nOn the other hand, in January 2024, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced a major investment of $1 billion in a new data centre located in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, UK. This decision also highlights Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s commitment to supporting the digital economy of the UK and fostering innovation in AI-powered technologies. The 33-acre site not only promises to provide crucial compute capacity but also brings forth job opportunities for the local community, both in construction and technical roles. This investment aims to enhance the reliability of digital services for Google Cloud customers and users within the UK and beyond.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also committed to sustainability as it plans to operate all data centres and campuses on carbon-free energy by 2030. In alignment with this ambition,  Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced a power purchase agreement in 2022 for offshore wind energy generated by the Moray West wind farm in Scotland, which will contribute 100 MW of energy to the grid. Moreover, the new UK data centre will feature provisions for off-site heat recovery, presenting an opportunity for energy conservation and benefitting nearby homes and businesses.\n\nThis investment in the UK data centre is part of  Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s  broader commitment to the country and Europe in general. It follows previous investments such as the $1 billion purchase of the Central Saint Giles office in 2022 and the development in King's Cross. 15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Europe\n\n25 Safest Cities in Europe to Visit In 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the countries with the highest average salaries in Europe, we relied on our database of the highest average salary countries for different professions ranging from engineers to doctors to caregivers to bankers and even designers.

Italy\n\nAverage Salary: $43,920\n\nWhile Italy is known to pay high salaries, there still exists the gender wage gap of around 5%. Women represent only 42.8% of the workforce and have the lowest employment rate in the EU at 51.7%. Structural imbalances also persist as 60% of the pay gap arises from differing job roles within companies, and 40% from women being concentrated in lower-paying sectors.\n\nItaly is also one of the countries that produce the best fashion designers.\n\n14. United Kingdom\n\nAverage Salary: $44,323\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for the attractiveness of UK when it comes to salaries and jobs is its high foreign investment. In 2023, the UK saw a notable uptick in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), recording 985 projects. The UK's share of Europe's inward investment market grew to 17.3%, reflecting a significant rise from 2022's 15.6%. Despite some challenges, Greater London has been a primary beneficiary of investment growth, particularly in technology and financial services, becoming the leading European region for investment.\n\n13. Belgium\n\nAverage Salary: $45,348\n\nIn Belgium, the minimum wage has climbed to €2,029.88 ($2186) per month as of April 1st and hence,  it is now among the top five EU states with minimum wages surpassing €2,000 ($2154. This rise, coupled with a tax employment bonus boost, is set to positively impact around 80,000 low-income earners in 2024. It is one of the best-paying countries in Europe as it pays the some of the highest salaries to doctors, engineers, and lawyers.\n\n12. Netherlands\n\nAverage Salary: $45,870\n\nNetherlands is one of the countries with the highest average salaries in Europe per month. It is also interesting to note that the average gross hourly wage increased by 7% last year, marking the most substantial increase in 45 years, according to Statistics Netherlands. The Netherlands is also one of the highest paying countries for data scientists.\n\n11. Sweden\n\nAverage Salary: $46,020\n\nLabor unions negotiate for fair pay and good benefits for workers in the country. Plus, Sweden cares a lot about making sure everyone has equal opportunities, so workers are provided with healthcare and ample time off when they need it without compromising on wages. All of these things together help keep salaries high in the country. With an average salary of $46,020 and a high quality of life, Sweden is one of the countries in Europe that are the best to earn money.\n\n10. Austria\n\nAverage Salary: $46,379\n\nAustria's high salaries can be attributed to several factors like its highly stable economy driven by industries such as technology, finance, and tourism. Companies like Red Bull, Erste Group, and Voestalpine also contribute largely to the country's economic prosperity.\n\n9. Republic of Ireland\n\nAverage Salary: $48,887\n\nIn Ireland, the economy is projected to rebound with growth rates of 2.3% this year and 2.5% next year, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). However, challenges continue to stay as inflation and higher interest rates have dampened spending and investment, resulting in a mere 0.5% growth in modified domestic demand (MDD) last year.\n\n8. Finland\n\nAverage Salary: $49,613\n\nWith a focus on technology and research in Finland, sectors like IT, engineering, and healthcare thrive, offering ample employment opportunities. Additionally, Finland prioritizes work-life balance, providing generous benefits and flexible work arrangements.\n\n7. Monaco\n\nAverage Salary: $51,000\n\nSalaries in Monaco are exceptionally high primarily due to the Principality's strong economic performance as evident in its GDP figures. With a GDP of 8.34 billion (8.98 billion) Euros in 2022 with an 11.1% increase from the previous year, Monaco's economic growth surpasses global and French averages.\n\n6. Iceland\n\nAverage Salary: $52,440\n\nWith an average salary of $52,440, Iceland is one of the top 10 countries with the highest average salaries in Europe.

        "title": "Should You Be Adding Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Fast Is Alphabet Growing?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Alphabet has managed to grow EPS by 21% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Alphabet shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 25% to 30%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Alphabet's future profits.\n\nAre Alphabet Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Alphabet, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$215b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Alphabet, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$14m.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet offered total compensation worth US$8.8m to its CEO in the year to December 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nShould You Add Alphabet To Your Watchlist?\n\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Alphabet's strong EPS growth. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Alphabet look rather interesting indeed. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this freediscounted cashflow valuation of Alphabet.\n\nAlthough Alphabet certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Climbing 467% over the past three years, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has skyrocketed as investors have raced to gain artificial intelligence (AI) exposure. Those looking to add AI exposure to their portfolios may feel they've missed the boat on Nvidia stock. Plus, they may feel overwhelmed by the variety of other choices to consider.\n\nBut the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: CHAT) has all those bases covered. In addition to holding a large position in Nvidia, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF provides exposure to a variety of other AI-focused companies that stand to benefit from growth in generative AI, machine learning, and large language models.\n\nThis is going to be big\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that people had little exposure to generative AI. Nowadays, it feels unavoidable. \r\nAnd it's nearly a certainty that its presence in our lives is going to continue ramping higher. In fact, many pundits predict that it's going to accelerate considerably. Business intelligence firm Markets and Markets projects the generative AI market will represent about $21 billion in 2024 and soar at a 37% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 when it will reach $137 billion.\n\nEager to benefit from the growth in generative AI, investors have unsurprisingly raced to Nvidia stock. A leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia helps data centers handle the tremendous computing demands that generative AI platforms place on them. With its recent rise, however, Nvidia stock is now trading at 69 times operating cash flow (OCF), making it unappealing for those looking to avoid high valuations.\n\nAn AI ETF like no other\n\nBranding the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF as the \"world's first Generative AI ETF,\" Roundhill Investments, the manager of the fund, cites research from GoldmanSachs that estimates AI can contribute to $7 trillion in economic growth worldwide over the next 10 years.\n\nWith 46 holdings in the fund, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF offers investors wide exposure to leading companies that will drive the advancement of generative AI. Of course, Nvidia holds a prominent position in the ETF with a 10.1% weighting, making it the largest position, so those wary of Nvidia stock on its own will still have some exposure. Rounding out the top-three positions, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are the second- and third-largest positions, respectively.\n\nWhereas Nvidia makes the GPUs that help support generative AI computing, Microsoft is developing AI solutions such as Copilot, an AI assistant that integrates with several Microsoft products. The company's reach in AI extends further with its multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT. Similarly, Google is incorporating AI into offerings such as Gemini, a generative AI chatbot. And in exploring the potential for AI in various applications, Google operates the DeepMind Lab where its exploring the development of artificial general intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META), whose Llama 3 large language model can be used to develop generative AI applications, is the fifth-largest position in the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, it's not only Magnificent Seven stocks that hold top spots; Adobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) is the fourth-largest position. A generative AI application, Adobe's Firefly can be used across various Adobe products, such as Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator.\n\nIs the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology right for you?\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia stock is extremely alluring right now considering the company's position as a stalwart GPU developer, but it's hardly the only generative AI game in town. Investors cognizant of this fact -- and who are looking for comprehensive exposure to the industry -- therefore will want to pay particular attention to the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, which provides a singular opportunity to gain broad exposure to generative AI. I know I am. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been on my watchlist for several months now, and I plan on starting a position in the coming weeks to sit in the niche of my portfolio carved out for growth investments.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 18.4% of His Portfolio Invested in This \"Magnificent Seven\" Dividend Stock",
        "content": "One of the most interesting investors on Wall Street is Bill Ackman. Ackman is the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund primarily focused on technology and consumer businesses.\n\nWhat differentiates Ackman from other money managers is that his portfolio generally holds a small number of stocks as opposed to a large basket of diversified opportunities.\n\nCurrently, while other portfolio managers are buying up big tech on the backdrop of an exciting narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), Ackman only owns one member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nApproximately 18.4% of his portfolio is allocated to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), a leader in internet search and cloud computing.\n\nLet's dig into why Ackman has such high conviction for Alphabet, and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\n\nAdvertising is the core business, but...\n\nAlphabet owns two of the world's most visited websites: Google and YouTube. Despite intense competition from Meta Platforms and TikTok, advertisers are eager to take advantage of Alphabet's enormous surface area on the internet.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the company is able to command immense pricing power from its advertising partners, leading to robust revenue and profit growth. Alphabet's first quarter 2024 revenue breakdown\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet generated $70.4 billion of revenue from the services segment -- an increase of 14% year over year. The company's services segment combines advertising and sales of subscriptions and devices. While advertising comprises more than three-quarters of Alphabet's total sales, it's the margin profile that I think is even more important.\n\nAlphabet's services segment reported a 40% operating margin. By comparison, this division's operating margin was 35% during the first quarter of 2023.\n\nBy expanding margins, Alphabet is able to produce excess cash flow that it can use to reinvest into the business. Some of the more prominent areas for internal investment include cloud computing and AI, among other shareholder rewards programs.\n\n...cloud computing could be a hidden gem\n\nCloud infrastructure is dominated by Amazon and Microsoft. However, Alphabet has demonstrated its ability to compete at a high level in this arena.\n\nDuring the first quarter, sales of Google Cloud Platform rose 30% year over year to $9.6 billion. Similar to the services business, Alphabet's cloud operation is consistently profitable. This is a notable feat, because just two years ago Google Cloud was a major source of cash burn for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nA major reason for the turnaround in the company's cloud business is AI. Large enterprises including Uber Technologies, Etsy, PayPal, and Bristol Myers Squibb are utilizing AI-powered services within Alphabet's cloud platform.\n\nBy marrying AI with the cloud, Alphabet is able to offer a full spectrum of products and services across its ecosystem -- spanning workplace productivity, cybersecurity, and accelerated computing. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Alphabet doing with its cash pile?\n\nAt the end of Q1, Alphabet held $108 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. In addition to aggressive ambitions in AI, Alphabet has found some other creative ways to ignite some excitement from shareholders.\n\nNamely, Alphabet announced that it is repurchasing up to $70 billion of stock. This is an interesting move because it could suggest that management views Alphabet stock as undervalued, despite a 17% gain so far this year.\n\nI think what really surprised investors was the announcement of Alphabet's first ever dividend. I see this as a strategy to win over shareholders, and a sign that management sees sustained, robust cash flow in Alphabet's future. GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThere aren't many companies that have as broad a reach or as diversified a business profile as Alphabet. And yet, Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 22.1 is among the lowest of the Magnificent Seven peer set.\n\nI think a lot of investors are missing the forest for the trees when it comes to Alphabet. The themes explored above clearly indicate that Alphabet is making notable inroads in AI and has the potential to benefit in many different ways. More importantly, these investments are already yielding efficiencies for Alphabet.\n\nAs a result, the company carries a staggering amount of cash, which it is using to further penetrate the AI realm, all while rewarding shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.\n\nAckman could be onto something as it pertains to his large allocation of Alphabet stock. Investors with a long-term time horizon may want to consider scooping up shares in Alphabet at its current valuation. To me, the company's best days are ahead and the stock looks dirt cheap right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Stocks That Could Make You Richer in 2024",
        "content": "One of the best ways to build lasting wealth in the stock market is to buy the shares of strong companies with exceptional growth prospects. To help you position yourself for a lucrative 2024, here are two superior businesses that are generating handsome returns for their investors.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nThe digital advertising market will top $870 billion by 2027, up from roughly $600 billion in 2023, according to Statista. Google's dominance of the internet search industry places Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) in a strong position to profit as more ad spending shifts online in the coming years.\n\nYouTube offers Alphabet's shareowners another excellent way to gain from the growth of digital ads. With a stunning 2.7 billion users that collectively consume 1 billion hours of content on its platform every day, according to DemandSage, the massively popular video-sharing platform is an indispensable platform for digital marketers.\n\nMoreover, YouTube is a powerful growth driver. Its sales were up more than 20% year over year to $8 billion in the first quarter. Investors can expect this figure to climb steadily in the years ahead. Demand Sage forecasts that YouTube's user base will grow to 2.85 billion by 2025. Additionally, YouTube's ad sales could receive a boost if rival TikTok is banned from operating in the U.S.\n\nAlphabet's shareholders also stand to benefit from the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Soaring demand for AI model training services and other machine learning workloads is fueling the growth of Google Cloud, the company's computing infrastructure division. Google Cloud's revenue leaped 28% year over year to $9.6 billion in the first quarter. Its operating profits, in turn, rose nearly fivefold to $900 million.\n\nHere, too, Alphabet has a tremendous long-term expansion opportunity. The global cloud computing market will grow to a staggering $2.5 trillion by 2032, up from $495 billion in 2022, according to Acumen Research and Consulting.\n\nWith so much room for profitable growth still ahead, Alphabet's stock is a solid buy today. Management appears to agree. On April 25, the company boosted its share repurchase program by a whopping $70 billion. Alphabet also said it would begin paying a dividend, which should place its stock on the radar of more income-focused investors.\n\n2. Eli Lilly\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that obesity can lead to dangerous illnesses like diabetes and heart disease. Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) wants to combat these worrisome health trends by helping people lose excess body fat. In turn, its game-changing weight-loss treatment, Zepbound, might just become the best-selling drug of all time.\n\nStory continues\n\nZepbound is an incretin-based therapy that works by stimulating hormones that can decrease a person's appetite and, by extension, the amount of food he or she eats. A 72-week clinical study showed that people who received the highest dose of the once-weekly injection lost an average of 48 pounds.\n\nBetter still, trial participants who were administered Zepbound and implemented a diet and exercise plan improved their cholesterol and blood pressure profiles. Other clinical trials showed that the active ingredient in Zepbound, tirzepatide, can improve blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes.\n\nDue to these promising results, Eli Lilly is expected to enjoy enormous demand for its new drugs. The healthcare titan's sales and profits surged by 26% and 67%, respectively, to $8.8 billion and $2.2 billion in the first quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Eli Lilly's earnings per share are forecasted to increase by more than 50% annually over the next half-decade. Peering even further into the future, investment bank Goldman Sachs posits that sales of anti-obesity drugs could grow to a whopping $100 billion by 2030. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to profit alongside Eli Lilly as it works to satisfy the torrid demand for its new weight-loss treatments.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Think Nvidia Is Overvalued? Buy This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "Those who invested in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) a few years ago are sitting pretty right now. The tech giant has seen its shares skyrocket, even more so than its otherwise high-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, partly thanks to its artificial intelligence (AI) system sales.\n\nHowever, as is often the case with stocks that crush the market, some investors are now worried about valuation. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 35 -- where the average for the S&P 500 is 20 -- Nvidia's shares don't exactly look cheap.\n\nThe premium might be justified if the chipmaker continues delivering the kinds of results it has lately, but for investors who want a cheaper Magnificent Seven stock that can also allow them to profit from the AI boom, let's consider why Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a solid option.\n\nAI will be a significant growth driver\n\nThe rise of generative AI leader ChatGPT initially spooked Alphabet's shareholders. Some saw the technology as being a Google killer. Alphabet generates the bulk of its revenue from ads on Google, so if it loses significant market share in online search, its financial results will worsen considerably.\n\nThis is a reasonable fear, but Alphabet wasn't worried. The company has been implementing AI within its business for years, including in updates to its Google algorithms.\n\nAlphabet quickly released its ChatGPT competitor, Bard, which has since been rebranded as Gemini. Alphabet's Gemini goes beyond text generation into videos, images, and computer coding. The company is still improving Gemini and other AI models it has developed while integrating various AI features throughout its business to make it more efficient and productive, from online search to advertising services.\n\nThe result should be stronger top-line growth and operating margins. Alphabet also offers various AI services through its cloud business, Google Cloud. As company CEO Sundar Pichai said during Alphabet's first-quarter earnings conference call:\n\nOur differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI start-ups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\n\nThe race to develop more sophisticated generative AI platforms should be a growth driver for Alphabet.\n\nMore reasons to buy\n\nAlphabet's forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratio is just under 22, which is still higher than the S&P 500's average but much lower than Nvidia's. Perhaps Alphabet's comparatively low P/E reflects the fact that it isn't growing as fast. Still, the business is solid and continues to deliver strong financial results. In the first quarter, the company's total revenue of $80.5 billion increased by a healthy 15.4% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's operating margin landed at 32%, higher than the 25% generated in the prior-year quarter, while its net earnings per share of $1.89 was 61.5% higher. Alphabet has other growth drivers beyond AI, including in streaming with YouTube. The website is the leader in streaming in terms of watch time, though it isn't exactly comparable to platforms like Netflix that offer movies and TV shows.\n\nStill, the increase in viewing time is a magnet for advertisers who will continue to flock to the platform so long as YouTube remains a leader, something that shouldn't change anytime soon. YouTube benefits from the network effect: The more content creators on the platform, the more it becomes attractive to viewers, and vice versa. Alphabet should still have a long runway for growth in this area.\n\nLastly, the company recently announced it was initiating a quarterly dividend per share of $0.20. And for what it's worth, the tech giant will also repurchase $70 billion worth of its shares.\n\nWill Alphabet become a great dividend stock in time? It's too early to tell. However, given the company's solid underlying business, strong cash flow generation, and multiple growth avenues, it has the tools to be an excellent dividend payer. Incidentally, these qualities also make the stock a great buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge",
        "content": "Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up.\n\nSo does the rest of Silicon Valley.\n\nA landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.\n\nGoogle's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: \"Google is winning because it’s better,\" he said.\n\nA government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court on Oct. 30, in Washington, D.C., after testifying in the antitrust case against his company. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nThat's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.\n\nIn Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.”\n\nA similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance.\n\n\"The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,\" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross.\n\n\"I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,\" Ross added, \"and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.\"\n\nThe government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.\n\nGenerally, Ross said, prosecutors are inclined to craft narrower market definitions to make it easier to prove a defendant holds a monopoly.\n\nHow courts react to those arguments, he added, will be significant.\n\nNew York University Law professor Harry First said the impact of Google's case also depends on the extent to which the judge accepts or rejects one of the government’s antitrust theories — that Google’s collective actions qualify as anticompetitive.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat strategy has been unsuccessful for the DOJ so far, including in its landmark case in the 1990s that eventually forced Microsoft (MSFT) into a settlement to open its operating system to competitors in the early 2000s. Amit Mehta, left, is the judge overseeing the Google antitrust case. Here he is pictured in 2012 when he was an attorney before the New York State Supreme Court. (DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\nBut if the judge in the Google case is persuaded that the theory has some merit, First explained, it could alter the way future antitrust cases are evaluated.\n\n\"I'm curious to see the extent to which the government tries to return to that theme and maybe move it in a direction that could be useful in other cases,\" First said.\n\nMany companies could be impacted by what the judge decides, even beyond the world of tech.\n\nA government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.\n\nThe government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\nGovernment prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.\n\nIn 2022, according to prosecutors, those payments totaled roughly $20 billion. The DOJ said its figure represented 15%-20% of Apple’s worldwide net income. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in April. (REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nSome tech companies, however, stand to gain if the government ultimately prevails.\n\nA breakup of Google’s contractual arrangements could boost rival search engines like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo.\n\nIt could also open the door to newcomer search engines and mobile manufacturers.\n\nAmazon, for its part, exited the mobile phone market after Google's contracts allegedly prevented it from attracting manufacturers to its alternative operating system, Fire OS, a competing \"fork\" to Google’s Android operating system.\n\nProsecutors said manufacturers were concerned that Amazon's partnership with Bing for mobile search services would risk lucrative deals with Google.\n\nThe government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.\n\nThe outcome of November's presidential election could also impact the case, which was brought under former President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nIf Biden is defeated, a new administration could decide to pursue different remedies or drop the case altogether.\n\nThe judge in this case, Mehta, may or may not have tipped his hand in his final questions to the lawyers during closing arguments this past week.\n\nHe pushed back on arguments made by both sides.\n\n\"You can talk about competition, but the competitor bears some responsibility for competing,\" Mehta said while also questioning why new rivals were not pushing to enter Google's market — and whether that's even possible.\n\n“It seems to be very, very unlikely, if not impossible, under the current market conditions,” Mehta said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia: Billionaire Dan Loeb Is Betting on This Dividend-Paying Magnificent Seven Stock to Win the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race Instead",
        "content": "Many savvy technology investors and entrepreneurs agree: The AI revolution is the real deal, and will likely transform our lives in the years to come. But unlike other disruptive revolutions, this one should actually benefit many current incumbent technology giants. These powerful companies are, after all, the only ones with the massive financial war chests and diverse technology know-how to deploy this extremely expensive and difficult technology at scale.\n\nNo wonder the Magnificent Seven Stocks have taken off recently. But while AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) gets most of the attention, its stock has also taken off into the stratosphere and trades at a high valuation for a chip stock.\n\nThat's why billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb is betting on one of the cheapest Mag Seven stocks as his new AI bet instead.\n\nThird Point Invests in Alphabet in Q1\n\nIn his first quarter letter to shareholders, Loeb detailed the firm's new buy of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) as a cheap way to play the AI race.\n\nIt should be noted that Loeb also said AI-related bets comprised about half of Third Point's holdings today. So, Loeb is clearly bullish on this powerful trend, which accelerated following the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that AI stocks rarely come cheap these days. But as Loeb spelled out in his Q1 letter, Google's initial missteps in the rollout of its large language model, Gemini, which seeks to compete head-to-head against ChatGPT, provided that window of opportunity.\n\nThe much-anticipated rollout of Gemini in February didn't go quite as planned. When prompted by early users to create historical images, Gemini often depicted racially diverse figures in historical settings in which it was not historically accurate to do so, and these politically charged inaccuracies were well-publicized. In response, Google's stock fell to a year-to-date low in early March.\n\nHowever, Loeb wrote in his letter:\n\nAssigning primacy to a small operational misstep while demoting the fact that the company has been building world-class capabilities in AI for over a decade, created an attractive entry point for a long-term investor. While it is easy to forget that the original paper on Transformers which paved the way for the rise of LLMs was published by Google engineers, and that it was Alphabet that built two of the leading AI research organizations (Google Brain and DeepMind), when news reports previewed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) intentions to embed Gemini into iOS, investors paid attention. We believe the moment when Gemini takes a seat at the economic table is approaching.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only does Loeb see Alphabet's AI team eventually working out the kinks in Gemini to make it a pre-eminent LLM, Loeb also notes AI has the potential to greatly enhance Alphabet's current core businesses across Search, YouTube, Android, cloud and others. And rather than being threatened by AI, Loeb thinks Google Search could actually become even more of a trusted source of information, as the post-AI internet becomes full of \"ad-supported content full of fakes.\" Dan Loeb bet on Alphabet in the first quarter 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bet pays off\n\nLoeb had good reason to expound on Third Point's Alphabet position in the first quarter. Five days before his letter came out, Alphabet reported first quarter earnings that handily beat analyst expectations. In addition, the company announced its first-ever dividend payment, which amounts to a 0.5% dividend yield at this stock price.\n\nThe dividend payment was interesting, as management showed confidence in its growth path while also giving a nod to the company's newfound focus on operational efficiency since the downturn of 2022.\n\nIn any case, Alphabet rallied higher following the April 25 release, and is now up about 20% on the year and roughly 25% from it March lows.\n\nHow Alphabet's stock looks after the rally\n\nEven after its recent rally, Alphabet trades at less than 26 times trailing earnings and just 21 times its 2025 earnings estimates. That's still among the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Not only that, but Alphabet also has a substantial $108 billion cash hoard, and it's still losing over $1 billion every quarter on its \"Other Bets\" segment.\n\nStripping out those two factors, and Alphabet's core Search, YouTube, Android, and Cloud businesses are trading at an even cheaper valuation than Alphabet's headline P/E ratio would suggest. In this Alphabet shareholder's opinion, investors would do well to follow Loeb into the stock for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW): This AI Stock Is Severely Underrated",
        "content": "Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock is fresh off a nasty snowfall following its recent quarterly results that coincided with a surprising CEO change and disappointing guidance. Since its 52-week peak of $237.72 per share, SNOW stock has shed about 33% of its value. With plenty of AI innovations recently unveiled (with more likely to come), shares of the severely underrated artificial intelligence (AI) stock now seem way too oversold.\n\nUndoubtedly, the last Snowflake quarter had a lot for investors to digest, perhaps too much such that they got a bad bout of indigestion. The softer guidance warranted a bit of punishment, especially given how lofty the multiple had become going into the quarter. That said, I think many investors are dismissing the capabilities of its new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy.\n\nIn my prior piece covering Snowflake post-earnings, I urged investors to give Snowflake’s new CEO the benefit of the doubt, given what he brings to the table in expertise, specifically on AI during his time at Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Neeva.\n\nGiven a chance, I’d say that Snowflake’s new leader, a scientist and visionary who knows AI probably better than most other high-level executives, may prove a worthy successor as Snowflake repositions its skis for the era of generative AI. With new AI products unveiled and freshly lowered expectations, I’m not hesitant to stay bullish on SNOW stock while it’s going for less than $160 per share.\n\nSnowflake’s Arctic AI Model Could be a Huge Deal for the Enterprise\n\nWith the recent launch of Snowflake’s new open-source enterprise large language model (LLM) Arctic, which boasts an impressive 480 billion parameters, Snowflake has officially boarded the LLM train. It will also be interesting to see how the technology “optimized for complex enterprise workloads” will translate into growth over the next few years.\n\nOf course, it’s going to take some time before Snowflake’s latest AI innovations propel its stock higher again. After the latest sell-off in SNOW shares, however, expectations seem modest enough that a surprising beat may be in the cards in the near future. Additionally, I find the Arctic news to have been rather muted, especially given the potential advantages it may possess over other enterprise-focused LLMs on the market.\n\nIndeed, AI model launches and announcements don’t seem as exciting in 2024 as in 2023. Some may view LLMs as becoming commoditized, with new chatbots seemingly being released regularly. From OpenAI to Anthropic to the Magnificent Seven companies, it seems every firm has a hand in the AI pie right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the number of open-source and proprietary AI models grows over time, we may very well be witnessing a serious uptick in competition. That said, I don’t view LLMs as getting commoditized, not when there are so many ways that one model can differentiate itself from others. At the end of the day, it probably won’t matter how many offerings there will be; the herd will flock to the very best model for their needs, and it’s more than just about power or the number of parameters.\n\nMore efficient and custom-tailored AI models may be superior to raw power. And on that front, I view Snowflake as having the potential to make noise in AI. Reportedly, Snowflake’s Arctic is more cost-efficient to train than the competition, requiring one-eighth of the cost versus comparable rivals. That’s some serious efficiency that many investors may be sleeping on.\n\nIt’s More About AI Monetization in These Early Stages\n\nAfter less than two years since ChatGPT took the world by storm, many of us are probably exhausted from hearing about the specs of the latest LLMs (parameters, benchmarks, etc.). We want to know how these innovations can make money and power growth. Until the air is clear on how these new models plan to earn money (some financial estimates would be nice), it may be tougher to raise the needle based on AI model launches alone.\n\nRegardless, it may be a mistake to discount the growth potential of new LLMs like Arctic, given the edge it sports over the competition.\n\nIn the next innings of the AI boom, I’d expect efficiency and personalization to be the biggest differentiating factors between AI combatants. At this juncture, Snowflake seems to have both metrics down as it aims to empower and enable enterprise customers to harness the power of their data.\n\nIt’s not just the Arctic LLM that could help position Snowflake for AI upside. The company has no shortage of AI features to make users’ lives easier. From its Cortex service (for managing and improving software development processes) to Document AI (for transforming unstructured document data into structured data), it’s clear Snowflake can build a moat around its ecosystem by going all-in on AI.\n\nIs SNOW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, SNOW stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 37 analyst ratings, there are 24 Buys, 11 Holds, and two Sell recommendations. The average SNOW stock price target is $211.26, implying upside potential of 32.6%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $125.00 per share to a high of $260.00 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SNOW Stock\n\nIndeed, there’s a great deal of uncertainty about just how much bacon a new AI can pull in over the course of many years. And for a firm like Snowflake, which uses a volatile usage-based revenue recognition model, I’d argue that it’s far better to err on the side of caution when it comes to estimates, especially in the face of great economic uncertainty.\n\nWith a robust and growing AI presence (Arctic and other AI innovations) and an “AI man” now running the show, I think Snowflake’s best days (at least for a public company) are still ahead of it.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ready to Invest in Artificial Intelligence in 2024? 2 Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades (Hint: They're Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is probably the most talked-about investment area right now -- and for good reason. The AI market is expected to expand at a double-digit compound annual growth rate over the next few years to reach more than $1 trillion by 2030. That means many companies -- and those who invest in them -- may benefit.\n\nOn top of this, AI is generating excitement because it offers concrete examples of how it could save companies time and money. For example, it can streamline processes or help a pharmaceutical company develop drugs more quickly. So, it's easy to understand the importance of this technology. And that means you may want to start investing in AI players in 2024, in the early days of this high-growth story.\n\nNvidia, the world's leading AI chipmaker, might seem like the obvious choice -- but this high-flying stock isn't the only game in town. In fact, two other AI players make fantastic stocks to buy and hold for decades thanks to their investments in AI -- and the potential for this technology to boost their earnings over time. Let's check them out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), as the parent of Google, already is the global Internet search leader, holding more than 85% share. And the company's investment in AI is likely to keep this going. Alphabet is applying AI to search to broaden its capabilities and improve search in general.\n\nThe company has been testing AI throughout search, serving billions of queries so far. The tests have shown increased search usage among people using the AI features and higher user satisfaction regarding search results. Here's why this is so important: Alphabet generates most of its revenue from advertisements on Google Search pages, and the more people use search, the more advertisers will keep coming back.\n\nIt's also important to remember that Alphabet offers six products that boast more than 2 billion monthly users, and these represent opportunities to integrate AI and grow revenue. Finally, Alphabet's Google Cloud business continues to increase revenue in the double-digits, and this could continue thanks to its selection of AI products and services. More than 60% of funded generative AI start-ups are already customers of Google Cloud, Alphabet said in its recent earnings call.\n\nAnd Alphabet also emphasized that it has \"clear paths\" to monetizing its investment in AI through ads, cloud, and subscriptions. All of this means AI could have a significant positive impact on Alphabet's business over time, making now a great moment to get in on this top tech stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) benefits from AI in two ways. First, its investments in the technology are helping it cut costs and please partners in its e-commerce business. And second, AI is boosting Amazon Web Services' (AWS) revenue as the business sells AI products and services.\n\nAs a global leader in e-commerce, Amazon strives to increase efficiency, and AI supports that by helping determine the fastest package delivery routes, for example. And a newly released tool allows Amazon to create a detailed product page for an item with just a link to the seller's website. Amazon says more than 100,000 sellers have used at least one of its generative AI tools.\n\nBut the biggest impact of all may be in the earnings potential of AWS, which is already the company's main profit driver. AWS, the world's leading cloud provider, sells a wide variety of AI products and services -- from top-performing Nvidia chips and platforms to AWS' own chips for the cost-conscious customer.\n\nAll this has helped AWS already generate a multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate. And it's important to remember we're still in the early days of AI adoption, so AWS' AI long-term growth prospects look particularly bright. The opportunity ahead is \"very large,\" CEO Andy Jassy said during the company's earnings call this week.\n\nSo, Amazon's already seeing significant revenue gains thanks to its AI investment, and this momentum may just be getting started -- and that makes it a top AI stock to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google Takes Questions Over Ads as US Trial Comes to a Close",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Judge Amit Mehta presided over two days of closing arguments, concluding on Friday, in the US antitrust challenge to Alphabet Inc. Now he’ll head off for weeks or months to consider a ruling that could have significant consequences across the tech industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEverything Apple Plans to Show at May 7 ‘Let Loose’ iPad Event Saudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel Online Apple Rallies Most in 18 Months on Upbeat Forecast, Buyback Trump Auditions VP Picks Before Wealthy Donors in Palm Beach Even the World’s Most-Envied Retirement Plan Is Falling Short\n\nYet despite frequent pointed questions to both sides, the Obama-appointed federal judge gave few hints about what he plans to decide.\n\nAntitrust enforcers allege that Alphabet’s Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. On Thursday and Friday, Mehta went over the exclusive multibillion-dollar deals Google has struck with Apple Inc. and others to be the default search engine on mobile phones and browsers. Then the judge turned to the lucrative advertising business Google runs by placing ads in search queries and the government’s view that the company’s dominance has allowed it to raise prices on advertisers without consequences.\n\nThe closing arguments come six months after testimony ended last November, in order to give the judge time to review the evidence. The case is the first antitrust trial pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades. Mehta is expected to issue a decision later this year on whether Google broke the law and his ruling could force the tech giant to change the way it does business, by demanding the separation of Alphabet’s search business from other products, like Android and Chrome.\n\nIn its defense, Google argued that search ads are just one avenue for advertisers to reach consumers and that it’s losing business to Amazon.com Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok.\n\nMehta appeared skeptical.\n\n“Advertisers came in and consistently said, ‘we can’t move away from search ads. They are unique,’” Mehta said.\n\nNo Other Choices\n\nJustice Department lawyer David Dahlquist said advertisers have no choice to reach the most consumers other than through Google’s search ads product — the text and shopping promotions that appear at the top of a results page in response to user queries.\n\nGoogle sells search ads through automated auctions that take place in less than a second after a person initiates a search. The Justice Department alleges that Google has made changes to its auction rules to increase prices by as much as 15%, while limiting the information marketers have about where their spending is going and making it harder for them to opt-out of specific advertising auctions.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Google kept advertisers in the dark as to how search advertising works and how their advertising dollars were spent,” Dahlquist said. “Only a monopolist can make a product worse, and still make money,” he said.\n\nIn response, Google’s lead litigator John Schmidtlein argued that Google raised the prices of search ads in conjunction with improving the quality of its ads.\n\nMehta asked why Google wasn’t more transparent about some of the changes it has made to its advertising auctions.\n\n“Isn’t that proof that Google is able to change prices in the background and advertisers are none the wiser?” he asked.\n\nTrade Secrets\n\nSchmidtlein said Google is “not in a position to go out and advertise its trade secrets, all the things it’s doing to improve. We’re not running around advertising all the improvements we are making so Bing can go out and copy them.”\n\nThe DOJ’s Dahlquist said that Google, even as a monopolist, still has some incentive to invest in improving its ad technology. But it’s a mistake to assume that improvements would necessarily lead to higher prices, he said, using the television market as an analogy: a TV bought today is less expensive than one from five years ago, in spite of the quality of the display having been improved, he asserted.\n\nDahlquist said such a scenario was an example of pricing having been bound by healthy competition in the market — something that isn’t happening in search advertising.\n\n“Just to be clear, your contention is that in a more competitive environment, advertisers would be paying less?” Mehta asked.\n\n“Yes,” said Dahlquist.\n\nChat Destruction\n\nNear the end of the hearing, Mehta chastised Google for failing to preserve documents that should have been turned over to the Justice Department during its antitrust investigation, suggesting he may find the company was negligent.\n\n“Google’s document retention policy leaves a lot to be desired,” he said, adding that it was “shocking to me that a company would leave it to their employees” to decide what would be retained.\n\n“We won’t know if there was a treasure trove of material not saved,” he added.\n\nThe Justice Department alleged that Google intentionally withheld key evidence through its “Communicate with Care” program, in which employees were instructed to have sensitive conversations over chats that would be automatically deleted after 24 hours, as well as to copy company lawyers when they didn’t need to.\n\nColette Connor, a lawyer for Google, said the company was clear with investigators from the Texas attorney general’s office and the Justice Department that the chats were deleted as part of the company’s regular practices.\n\nWhen the company first created its internal chat product, conversations were automatically archived. But in 2008, top executives announced a change so that conversations would disappear after 24 hours unless a person changed the archive settings.\n\nGoogle changed the policy last year after the Justice Department and other antitrust plaintiffs complained that the company was violating its legal obligations to retain all records for use in litigation.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Kenneth Dintzer said Google engaged in a “breathtaking” policy of “systemic document destruction” to avoid giving antitrust enforcers evidence of illegal behavior. It involved “communications that were not like, ‘Let’s have lunch,’” Dintzer said.\n\n“This was an intent to hide documents,” he said, showing a slide that read simply: “This is wrong.” “The evidence is unequivocal.”\n\nThe Justice Department asked that Mehta assume the destroyed evidence would have supported their case and sanction Google, which could take the form of a fine.\n\nIn subsequent comments, Mehta said Google’s policy was “unrealistic” to expect employees to know in advance that they should turn on a chat’s history. Given other evidence that Google was sensitive about words that could raise antitrust concerns, the failure to preserve chat “could be interpreted as intentional,” he said.\n\n“Shouldn’t there be some consequence?” Mehta said. “At a minimum this was not best practices.”\n\n(Updates with details on sanctions beginning in the 19th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Is Helping Automate One of the World’s Most Gruesome Jobs Will GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "I’m paid $14 an hour to rate AI-generated Google search results. Subcontractors like me do key work but don’t get fair wages or benefits",
        "content": "You probably google things a lot. But it’s unlikely you think about the subcontractors like me who make your search results safe and worthwhile.\n\nOn a typical weekday morning, I sit down at my computer in my home in Choctaw, Oklahoma, to start a day of work as a Google Search rater, evaluating the quality of search results—both live and experimental—to feed the search engine’s recommendations and rankings. I log into Google’s portal to see my first assigned task—if I have any, which has become less reliable since late last year. If I don’t, I wait until a new task appears, which can take unpaid hours of my day. Once I start a task, there is no indication of how many others are lined up behind it, and no tools to communicate with anyone. It’s just me, a timer, and a search result I must label as good or poor in a few minutes—less time than it takes to do the job right.\n\nThese days, most search results I evaluate are AI-generated, and I’m told to fact-check those by googling. That’s right: I fact check AI-generated search results with Google search results to populate future search results.\n\nThis is how Google’s search result sausage is made: Real people like me make it. The bad results we filter out include the fraudulent (sending you to a scam website when you try to buy your Nikes) and the downright dangerous (telling you it is safe to take a particular medication for your health condition when it absolutely isn’t).\n\nYet we don’t get receive fair wages and benefits. Google recently made that official, reversing a decision made in 2019, when the Alphabet subsidiary announced it’d require vendors to pay its “extended workforce” a minimum rate of $15 per hour plus health benefits. That followed employees protesting how the company treats people like me: the tens of thousands of temporary workers hired through vendors and subcontracted to Google.\n\nLast month, Google quietly removed that requirement, a blow for workers and our union’s organizing efforts, as well as for Google’s reputation as a kinder, gentler tech giant.\n\n\"These updates bring us in line with other large companies and simply clarify that Google is not, and has never been, the employer of our suppliers’ employees,\" a spokesperson told Reuters, adding that most of the tech giant’s suppliers operate in states that mandate a minimum wage of at least $15.\n\nMany of my colleagues and I, meanwhile, never did get that once-promised rate. Almost two years after starting at $14 an hour, I still earn the same amount. And this year—even before removing the vendor requirement—Google brought on other quality raters at $12 and even $10 an hour. The announcement about worker protections in 2019, it appears, was for show. And now that the economy has shifted and corners need to be cut to preserve shareholder earnings, Google is fully taking off the mask.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has said it removed the minimum rate requirement because it wants to make clear that it’s not a “joint employer” alongside the vendors who hired us. It’s a legal distinction of growing significance now that the government is debating the rights of companies trying to deny huge swaths of workers the benefits and pay that full-time employees would be owed.\n\nGoogle is playing defense now. It’s even introduced mandatory training for full-time employees on how to interact with contractors to ensure that the company can legally avoid claims of “co-employment” and any obligation to bargain collectively with us around our working conditions, judging by screen shots I’ve seen.\n\nYet in our work as quality raters, Google runs the show. We work on its platforms and follow its guidelines. Google assigns our time limits and determines the ratings we’re graded against. Our labor on its tools following its rules has helped the company rake in billions in search revenue.\n\nAnd now that the company is focusing on AI efforts, quality raters like me are critical to ensuring that search results aren’t littered with bad results and misinformation. We are the invisible backbone of Google, and we deserve a fair wage.\n\nIt’s not just contractors feeling the shift in Google’s mood. Unprecedented rolling layoffs over the past few years have affected thousands. The same week Google removed the minimum rate requirement, it fired more than 50 direct employees who exercised their right to protest against its cloud-computing deal with Israel.\n\nAfter the Women’s Walkout in 2018, and the 2019 protests against Google’s deals with military and government groups, the company made a show of being willing engage with workers’ concerns.\n\nLately, though, Google’s leaders are revealing the true face of the company. Less than a week after the latest firings and the abandonment of the minimum rate, Alphabet shares surged after the company reported strong revenue growth and announced its first-ever dividend and a new $70 billion round of stock buybacks. CEO Sundar Pichai is near or at billionaire status. The company has a cash pile of more than $100 billion.\n\nGoogle, it seems, has shed its commitment to workers. Shareholders seem to approve.\n\nThe actions against contractors and full-timers have a chilling effect on our efforts to improve our conditions. But as secretary of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA, I can tell you that we’re not scared. We’ve shown up at Google headquarters in California and at city council meetings across the country to petition for our rights, and we’re ready to keep fighting for fair pay and better conditions.\n\nSo, the next time you google something, think of me in Oklahoma. Remember that one of the world’s biggest companies doesn’t think the work I do to build the internet you use every day is worth protecting.\n\nToni Allen is a Google Search subcontractor and secretary of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA.\n\nMore must-read commentary:\n\nHow to handle job tasks in the hiring process, whether Gen Z is involved or not I host the world’s largest cybersecurity conference.

Our retail editor Hannah Boland reports:\n\nHenrietta Billings, director of SAVE Britain’s Heritage, said the Housing Secretary would be “firmly justified” in once again refusing M&S’s request to demolish its flagship Oxford Street building.\n\nMr Gove rejected the plans last year and SAVE Britain’s Heritage said he would be justified in coming to the same conclusion to block the project a second time. The Housing Secretary has been forced to reconsider his decision after a successful legal challenge by M&S.\n\nMs Billings said: “M&S’s destructive plans were conceived more than six years ago and they’re looking increasingly outdated.\n\n“So much has changed since then, from our understanding of the sustainability impacts of demolition and re-building from scratch – to the widespread public interest in this case and growing awareness about the need for change.”\n\nRead the full story...

Daniel Woolfson has the details:\n\nFears are growing over the risk of empty shelves as growers across Europe battle a combination of extreme weather, inflation and high interest rates.\n\nGiles Henschel, the owner of Olives et Al, a retailer of olives and olive oils, said: “The price of olive oil is unlikely to come down from where it is now. There will be shortages, there will not be enough.”\n\nMr Henschel has spent recent weeks on a motorcycle tour of olive growers across Europe, interviewing farmers and investigating the effects of climate change on the kitchen cupboard staple. He said: “I think we’re facing an existential threat to the business that we created.\n\n“Will we still be able to actually sell olives in three years time? I don’t know. And part of the reason for doing this is what have we got? Do we actually still have a business? Should we diversify?”\n\nHis comments come after Deoleo, Spain’s largest producer of olive oil, warned this week that the industry was facing “one of the most difficult moments in the history of the sector”.\n\nRead the full story...

US Justice Department lawyers have said the huge sum is indicative of how important it is for Google to make itself the default search engine and block competitors from getting a foothold.\n\nGoogle says that customers could easily click away to other search engines if they wanted, but that they invariably prefer Google. Companies such as Apple testified at trial that they partner with Google because they consider its search engine to be superior.

Nevertheless, it heavily reduced its pre-tax losses to £25.5m from £108.3m a year earlier.\n\nThe reduction came after significant cost-cutting, which it said provided a £6.2m boost last year.\n\nIt also deferred planned restaurant opening for last year to the end of this current year, saving it around £15m in capital expenditure.\n\nStephen Welker, chair of Hostmore, said: “2023 was a transitional year for Hostmore during which we successfully implemented a turnaround of the business.” TGI Fridays operator Hostmore said 2023 was a 'transitional year'\n\n12:46 PM BST\n\nSecond Boeing whistleblower dies in two months\n\nA second Boeing whistleblower has died just two months after his colleague was found dead with gunshot wounds in a car park.\n\nOur reporter Verity Bowman has the details:\n\nJoshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, warned of manufacturing defects in the planemaker’s 737 Max.\n\nHe filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) alleging “serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line” at Spirit.\n\nThe 45-year-old died on Tuesday after developing pneumonia following a “fast-moving” infection of Influenza B and MRSA.\n\nIt comes as Boeing has been plagued by a series of incidents involving its planes.

The CMA said it will start a new, in-depth investigation into the deal unless it accepts Pennon’s response.\n\nFTSE 250-listed Pennon bought Sumisho Osaka Gas Water UK, including its subsidiary SES Water, in January for £380m.\n\nSES Water supplies drinking water to south-east England, with 845,000 customers across East Surrey, West Sussex, west Kent and south London.\n\nJoel Bamford, executive director of mergers at the CMA, said: “Water services are vital to our day-to-day lives, whether at home or in the workplace, and we’re concerned that this deal could impact Ofwat’s ability to make comparisons and carry out its role of regulating the water sector.”\n\n11:00 AM BST\n\nGovernment’s new climate action plan unlawful, High Court rules\n\nThe Government acted unlawfully by approving a strategy to meet the UK’s climate targets, a High Court judge has ruled.\n\nEnvironmental charities Friends of the Earth and ClientEarth, and the Good Law Project, took joint legal action against the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero over its decision to approve the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (CBDP) in March last year.\n\nThe plan outlines how the country will achieve targets set out in the sixth carbon budget, which runs until 2037, as part of wider efforts to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nThe three groups argued at a hearing in February that the then-secretary of state, Grant Shapps, acted unlawfully by approving the plan as he lacked information on whether individual policies could be delivered in full.\n\nIn a ruling today, Mr Justice Sheldon ruled in their favour, stating that Mr Shapps’ decision was “simply not justified by the evidence”.\n\nHe said: “If, as I have found, the Secretary of State did make his decision on the assumption that each of the proposals and policies would be delivered in full, then the Secretary of State’s decision was taken on the basis of a mistaken understanding of the true factual position.”\n\n10:53 AM BST\n\nSociete Generale shares jump as earnings beat forecast\n\nSociete Generale suffered a big drop in profits in the first quarter but its shares rose after a strong performance in its investment business.\n\nShares in the French bank jumped by almost 6pc on the Paris stock exchange - exceeding their mid-September level - after it published the forecast-beating earnings.\n\nProfits after tax sank by 21.7pc to €680m (£581.5m) compared with the same period last year, while revenues fell 0.4 pc to €6.6bn.\n\nBut the bank’s earnings were slightly better than forecast by analysts.\n\nThe global banking and investor solutions arm posted a net profit of €690m, a 26.4pc jump from a year ago, though its revenues fell 5.1pc to €2.6bn.

The terms of the settlement are confidential following a trial which would have been costly for both sides.\n\nIt marks an anti-climatic ending to Mr Ashley’s pursuit of Morgan Stanley and some of its most senior bankers.\n\nHowever, as well as being embarrassing for an investment banking business which trades on discretion, the case raised questions over the conduct and policies of one of the world’s most powerful financial institutions which could invite unwelcome attention from financial regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nRead how the settlement comes as Morgan Stanley faces pressure from regulators over its internal processes.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 25 richest billionaires in technology industry. To skip our detailed analysis of the technology industry, go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires in Technology Industry.\n\nTechnology Market Outlook\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, 2023 experienced a technological comeback and generative AI was one of the major drivers of the tech industry. Generative AI is the technology that powers large language models such as ChatGPT and Adobe Photoshop's new AI image filler, Generative Fill. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the AI market was valued at $40 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 42%. The increasing demand for generative AI products will add nearly about $280 billion of new software revenue. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are four of the biggest tech companies investing heavily in generative AI and are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of AI, as per  Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIn a report, Deloitte highlighted that global IT investments are projected to experience a double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services in 2024. AI-related investments are expected to reach $200 billion globally by 2025, primarily led by the US. Almost all enterprise software firms will embed generative AI into at least some of their products in 2024, as per Deloitte. The shift towards generative AI will likely help software companies reach an average revenue of $10 billion by the end of 2024. For the firms working on the hardware front, Deloitte estimates their revenue to surpass $50 billion in 2024, driven by the chips and servers market.\n\nOn April 28, Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk, on X posted that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will spend around $10 billion in combined training and inference AI during 2024. Musk further said, “Any company not spending at this level, and doing so efficiently, cannot compete.”\n\nThe technology industry is diverse and has vast market segments. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global IT market was valued at $8.50 trillion in 2023 and is expected to reach $9.03 trillion in 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. By 2028, the IT market is anticipated to reach $12.41 trillion, growing at a compound growth rate of 8.3% from 2024 to 2028.\n\nMajor Players in The Technology Industry\n\nSome of the major players in the tech space include Alphabet Inc.

Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“It was a great quarter led by a strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we've gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue.\n\nNow, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation and search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths.”\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech giant that is massively expanding in AI services. On April 29, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that it is collaborating with German mass media firm, Axel Springer SE. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Axel Springer SE have expanded their partnership across advertising, AI, content, and cloud computing. The collaboration between the two firms aims to leverage cutting-edge innovation to evolve independent journalism worldwide. Here is what Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO, Satya Nadella, said regarding the partnership extension:\n\n“This new generation of AI is transforming nearly every aspect of work and life, including how people search for and consume content online. Our expanded partnership with Axel Springer brings together their leadership in digital publishing with the full power of the Microsoft Cloud — including our ad solutions — to build innovative AI-driven experiences and create new opportunity for advertisers and users.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world. The company is mainly focused on AI-driven technology across its segments. On April 19, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported that two of its latest chips, NVIDIA RTX A400 and A1000, will enhance AI-powered design and productivity workflows.

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Google, US clash over search advertising as trial winds down",
        "content": "(New throughout, adds start of arguments from government, Google)\n\nBy Mike Scarcella\n\nWASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) -\n\nGoogle and the U.S. Justice Department clashed in court on Friday over claims that the Alphabet unit unlawfully schemed to dominate search advertising, during closing arguments in a case the government contends could shape the “future of the internet.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington grilled both sides with questions, probing whether competitive platforms such as ByteDance’s TikTok and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram are competitive substitutes for search advertising dollars.\n\nMehta called platform “substitutability” for advertisers a central issue the court must resolve, as he prepares to render a major decision in coming months on whether Google's conduct broke antitrust law.\n\nThe judge also questioned whether Google assesses competitors’ pricing before making its own adjustments. Google's advertising business is responsible for about three quarters of its revenue.\n\nU.S. government lawyer David Dahlquist argued that “advertising revenue is what drives Google’s monopoly power today.”\n\nGoogle boasted it has no real market pressure, Dahlquist said, arguing that the company does not fear increasing its pricing or not improving its products. “Only a monopolist can make a product worse and still make more money,” Dahlquist argued.\n\nGoogle’s lawyer John Schmidtlein on Friday countered that Google’s share of U.S. digital advertising revenue has steadily decreased. He touted the advertising power of rival platforms ByteDance's TikTok, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, and Amazon.\n\nSchmidtlein argued that Google is “constrained” by rival platforms \"where the eyeballs are,\" because advertisers know there are overlapping audiences and can spend dollars away from Google.\n\nHe also asserted that Google was continually moving to innovate its search advertising products. “If Google is a monopolist, why improve anything? Why not just jack the price up?” he told the court.\n\nThe Justice Department has hammered away at Google in a trial that started on Sept. 12, contending the search engine giant is a monopolist that illegally abused its power to boost profits.\n\nWitnesses from Verizon, Android maker Samsung Electronics and Google itself testified about the company's annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\nMehta is expected on Friday to take up the government’s claim that Google intentionally destroyed internal documents that were relevant to the issues in the lawsuit. The government wants Mehta to presume that Google deleted chats that were unfavorable to the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle has defended its data preservation practices, calling them reasonable, and urged the court not to sanction the company.\n\nThe court is not expected to issue an oral ruling at the conclusion of the argument.\n\nThis case, filed by former President Donald Trump's administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in the market power of tech leaders.\n\nThe second, against Facebook parent Meta, was also filed during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers have followed with a second case against Google and cases against Amazon.com and Apple Inc.

The script automatically installs Google Chrome, configures the browser for gamepad use, and adds a GeForce Now shortcut to the user’s Steam library.\n\nThough the script handles the SteamOS terminal app for Chrome installation and gamepad support, some manual adjustments are necessary to optimize GeForce Now, the Verge reports.\n\nUpon launching GeForce Now, users must press the Steam menu, navigate to controller settings, and change the Current Button Layout to “Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad,” enabling trackpad control for the mouse inside GeForce Now.\n\nFor Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming overlay, long-press the Steam Deck’s menu button for more straightforward cloud gaming navigation. Nvidia cautions that certain games, like Genshin Impact, require gamepad input in the settings interface, which involves using the trackpad for menu navigation. Now, anticipation builds for a possible Microsoft script that would facilitate Xbox Cloud Gaming setup on the Steam Deck.\n\nNvidia offers manual instructions for both Edge and Chrome browsers.

        "title": "Google, Justice Department make final arguments about whether search engine is a monopoly",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Google's preeminence as an internet search engine is an illegal monopoly propped up by more than $20 billion spent each year by the tech giant to lock out competition, Justice Department lawyers argued at the closings of a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, maintains that its ubiquity flows from its excellence, and its ability to deliver results customers are looking for.\n\nThe U.S. government, a coalition of states and Google all made their closing arguments Friday in the 10-week lawsuit to U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who must now decide whether Google broke the law in maintaining a monopoly status as a search engine.\n\nMuch of the case, the biggest antitrust trial in more than two decades, has revolved around how much Google derives its strength from contracts it has in place with companies like Apple to make Google the default search engine preloaded on cellphones and computers.\n\nAt trial, evidence showed that Google spends more than $20 billion a year on such contracts. Justice Department lawyers have said the huge sum is indicative of how important it is for Google to make itself the default search engine and block competitors from getting a foothold.\n\nGoogle responds that customers could easily click away to other search engines if they wanted, but that consumers invariably prefer Google. Companies like Apple testified at trial that they partner with Google because they consider its search engine to be superior.\n\nGoogle also argues that the government defines the search engine market too narrowly. While it does hold a dominant position over other general search engines like Bing and Yahoo, Google says it faces much more intense competition when consumers make targeted searches. For instance, the tech giant says shoppers may be more likely to search for products on Amazon than Google, vacation planners may run their searches on AirBnB, and hungry diners may be more likely to search for a restaurant on Yelp.\n\nAnd Google has said that social media companies like Facebook and TikTok also present fierce competition.\n\nDuring Friday's arguments, Mehta questioned whether some of those other companies are really in the same market. He said social media companies can generate ad revenue by trying to present ads that seem to match a consumer's interest. But he said Google has the ability to place ads in front of consumers in direct response to queries they submit.\n\n“It's only Google where we can see that directly declared intent,” Mehta said.\n\nGoogle's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, responded that social media companies “have lots and lots of information about your interests that I would say is just as powerful.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has also argued that its market strength is tenuous as the internet continually remakes itself. Earlier in the trial, it noted that many experts once considered it irrefutable that Yahoo would always be dominant in search. Today, it said that younger tech consumers sometimes think of Google as “Grandpa Google.”\n\nWhile Google's search services are free to consumers, the company generates revenue from searches by selling ads that accompany a user's search results.\n\nJustice Department attorney David Dahlquist said during Friday's arguments that Google was able to increase its ad revenue through growth in the number of queries submitted until about 2015 when query growth slowed and they needed to make more money on each search.\n\nThe government argues that Google's search engine monopoly allows it to charge artificially higher prices to advertisers, which eventually carry over to consumers.\n\n“Price increases should be bounded by competition,” Dahlquist said. “It should be the market deciding what the price increases are.”\n\nDahlquist said internal Google documents show that the company, unencumbered by any real competition, began tweaking its ad algorithms to sometimes provide worse search ad results to users if it would increase revenue.\n\nGoogle's lawyer, Schmidtlein, said the record shows that its search ads have become more effective and more helpful to consumers over time, increasing from a 10% click rate to 30%.\n\nMehta has not yet said when he will rule, though there is an expectation that it may take several months.\n\nIf he finds that Google violated the law, he would then schedule a “remedies” phase of the trial to determine what should be done to bolster competition in the search-engine market. The government has not yet said what kind of remedy it would seek.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Apple Missing Out on the AI Hype?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence buzz across the tech world has increased over the past year. All the big players are competing with each other to grab a piece of this booming market. Nevertheless, one tech giant is seemingly on the limp in this race for dominance, or at least that's the image it wants to portray. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always stepped up the game by boosting innovation and enhancing the user experience. But with AI, the tech giant has been maintaining a discrete profile for a long time.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BTI.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that AI is here to revolutionize the tech landscape, a sort of renaissance if one thinks of it. PwC estimates AI will contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Given these rosy projections, Apple's toned-down approach toward the technology has raised speculations about whether it is missing out on the AI hype or playing its cards in silence to take the market by surprise.\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nDespite recent financial struggles, including a major revenue slump since the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Apple saw a nearly 50% spike last year, though it lagged other tech giants such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company had a challenging start to 2024 with shares tumbling amid a series of analyst downgrades and was dethroned by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world. Some critics have blamed Apple for not having a clear AI strategy unlike its competitors, such as Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which are aggressively investing in the technology.\n\nWhen it comes to AI (or machine learning, as Apple prefers to say), the company is not new to integrating such features into its devices. It has revolutionized many features using machine learning, including Siri, facial recognition and personalized recommendations. However, in the current landscape, compared to other tech giants, Apple has taken a more cautious approach to introducing and announcing AI features and investments. Apple is making calculated moves in the AI space behind the scenes. The company has acquired several AI start-ups in the past decade and is partnering with universities and research institutions to collaborate on projects.\n\nResearch and development spending is one of the key indicators to measure a company's commitment to introducing new features and advancements into its business strategy, especially for tech companies. Apple's R&D spending was roughly 7% of its revenue for 2022. In comparison, in the same year, Google and Microsoft allocated nearly double for R&D and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) spending was more than four times Apple's. According to the 2023 Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard by the European Commission, Apple ranks in fourth place, above Asian rivals Huawei (fifth) and Samsung (XKRX:005930) (seventh). However, the company ranks below Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft (first three places). While this spending disparity could be highlighting a difference in priorities, it is easy to overlook Apple's strategy of acquiring resources in other areas to step up innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle-Apple alliance: A double-edged sword\n\nRecent reports suggest Apple could enter an AI partnership with Alphabet's Google. As per Bloomberg, Apple is negotiating with the Google parent company to license its state-of-the-art AI model, Gemini. If the deal goes through, Apple might integrate Gemini's AI features into its upcoming operating systems for devices. The possibility of this partnership raises many questions about the company's long-standing tradition of prioritizing in-house development and tight control over its technology.\n\nGoogle and Apple have been in a strategic partnership for a long while and it has proven to be a profitable one. Currently, Google is the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser, and to secure this position Google is reportedly paying around $18 billion annually to Apple. Therefore, Google's AI model Gemini seems like a natural choice for Apple. However, other than the obvious contradiction of the iPhone maker's privacy-first policy, this deal might raise many other concerns, including legal challenges and reduced quality in the user experience.\n\nCurrently, tech giants are facing scrutiny around the world, especially from the U.S. government and European Union. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for its alleged monopoly on the smartphone market and unfair treatment of developers through its App Store system. Partnering with another major tech firm and a rival might fuel the current controversy and could attract more legal scrutiny. Moreover, if Apple begins to rely on Google for AI tools, it could stifle competition and reduce consumer choices in the future for potential AI feature upgrades. Google's AI is a cloud-based system that allows developers to use consumer data to strengthen the LLM to become more efficient, which means the privacy of the user data will not be assured. This means more red flags for Apple.\n\nThe current regulatory scrutiny is already hampering Apple's operations. The potential delay in winning the lawsuit and the restrictions that may be imposed by the government could hinder the company's efforts in the AI field. Additionally, the financial burden of a lawsuit could put a halt on the company's ability to find an internal AI solution. Moreover, a well-defined and transparent data protection framework should be put into practice before entering into a partnership with Google, if at all.\n\nApple's AI master plan\n\nEven though Apple is not vocal about its advancements with AI efforts, several ongoing projects are making progress. News surrounding the company's own AI model has garnered substantial traction. According to sources, Apple has reportedly developed a large language model called Ajax GPT, with a performing capacity exceeding GPT 3.5. Also, it may be working on an AI-powered chatbot dubbed Apple GPT.\n\nApple might have been suspiciously quiet about AI in product launches. However, it has acquired the greatest number of startups among all tech giants since 2017. The company is likely to have spent around $1 billion in acquiring various AI ventures. In 2023 alone, Apple reportedly bought more than 30 AI ventures. These acquisitions take place mostly to cover various specialties such as self-driving technology, voice design, music generation and image recognition, but sometimes to even acquire the talented individuals behind these startups.\n\nThe latest and most important addition to Apple's AI arsenal is DarwinAI. Acquiring DarwinAI can be seen as an investment in technology as well as personnel, particularly specialists in machine learning and AI from the University of Waterloo. A prominent figure in the AI community and former director at the University of Waterloo, Alexander Wang, is currently appointed as a director at Apple, leading the company's AI efforts in Canada. Also, DarwinAI's synthesis model is expected to help Apple's most ambitious AI capability; on-device AI (also referred to as Edge AI) with plans to move forward with generative AI programs in the future.\n\nTwo recent theses published by Apple have shown the company's effectiveness in incorporating advanced levels of AI within the pre-existing ecosystem. One research paper in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne delves into the development of the MM1 generative AI model. The results of the thesis demonstrate Apple's capabilities in developing cutting-edge AI architectures, particularly multimodal learning, which combines images with text data.\n\nAnother paper published showcases the successful execution of large language models in natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks with limited memory. The methods used in the thesis collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a four to 25 times increase in inference speed compared to other approaches in CPU and GPU. Ultimately, this research paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory to deliver exceptionally faster performance.\n\nBoth these research papers and recent acquisitions indicate Apple is on the right track to offering on-device AI capabilities that will far exceed what is currently available in the market.\n\nUsability focus is Apple's product strategy\n\nVoice Assistant, Facial Recognition, Photo optimization, Personalized recommendations, Animoji and Fitness tracking may look like functions that have nothing to do with AI, but all these features are fundamentally built upon various machine learning technologies. Apple was the pioneering tech brand that managed to integrate these features seamlessly into mobile devices successfully. Today, it is working behind the scenes to improve these features by integrating AI.\n\nWhen Siri, the voice assistant, was released, it was received remarkably well across the globe. But soon after the initial product launch, because of Siri's inability to complete slightly advanced tasks, its credibility declined. Following many internal conflicts faced by Apple's Siri team with engineers frustrated by a lack of tools and data to improve it, the chat bot has started lagging behind its competitors. Meanwhile, Google Assistant, with its superior natural language processing and ability to handle complex queries, and Amazon Alexa, with its vast compatible ecosystem, are gaining momentum.\n\nWith the new on-device AI integration, Apple may have reversed the future of Siri and also could enhance the performance of Apple fitness trackers. The Apple Watch already integrates AI features to enhance fitness tracking. For example, the watch uses machine learning to identify workout types and analyze heart rate data, helping to offer more personalized coaching assistance. However, some competitors offer more advanced AI-powered health monitoring features, including blood pressure monitoring.\n\nKeeping up with its brand of prioritizing the user experience more than anything else, Apple has made its first direct AI-related product with the new MacBook Air with an M3 chip highlighting its capabilities for AI tasks. This can be seen as a major breakthrough in Apple's AI strategy, promising its customers not a cloud-based AI service, but an on-device AI experience that upholds user privacy.\n\nApple follows a pattern of announcing new features as they are coming to the market. Therefore, the upcoming Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June may bring potential AI-related announcements. Speculations suggest AI features will be integrated into the new Mac OS as well as iOS 18. The speculations are further strengthened with Apple acknowledging the term AI in its latest quarterly earnings transcript, deviating from its usual terminology. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the introduction of generative AI software in Apple products later in the year.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of AI-integrated hardware such as Edge AI is expected to have a positive impact on the iPhone upgrade cycle. With the current upcycle period standing at a record high of 4.5 years, users upgrading their mobiles for a better AI-powered user experience will boost new hardware sales. This is crucial for Apple amid four straight quarters of sales declines and the dampening sales numbers in China. Analysts such as Dan Ives and Ben Reitzes believe that with AI integration, Apple will experience another supercycle in smartphone upgrades.\n\nApple's AI gamble - Missing out or playing the long game?\n\nApple may not be as aggressively discussing its AI plans compared to other tech giants, but the company is making steady progress behind the scenes. The company's on-device AI integration strategy may prove to be the differentiator in the future. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26, the stock is valued at a premium to the five-year average of 24. This premium may seem unjustifiable at first, but if the company's on-device AI strategy succeeds, a potential iPhone upgrade supercycle will help it book stellar revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Apple is certainly not missing out on AI despite not joining the hype publicly, yet. Contrarian investors may want to build a position in Apple to potentially benefit from a surprise AI announcement in the coming months.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple stock pops 6% after results top estimates, company reveals $110 billion buyback",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) stock rose as much as 6% on Friday after the tech giant reported earnings that beat forecasts, sales that fell less than feared, and announced a new $110 billion share repurchase plan.\n\nThe iPhone maker reported late Thursday second quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.53 on revenue of $90.8 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $1.50 on revenue of $90.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nApple's Greater China revenue, which includes mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, slid 8% year over year to $16.37 billion. That, however, was better than the $15.87 billion analysts were expecting. Apple CFO Luca Maestri told Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton that the company saw growth in mainland China during the quarter.\n\nThe company's all-important iPhone revenue totaled $45.96 billion, down from $51.33 billion in Q2 last year. Apple also announced it was authorizing an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and increased its dividend to $0.25 per share. Shareholder returns plans have become a feature of Big Tech results this year, with Meta initiating a dividend in February and Alphabet announcing its own plans to start paying a dividend late last month.\n\nAhead of Thursday's report, Apple stock had been down 10% this year, lagging many of its Big Tech peers and the broader market.\n\nIn its fiscal second quarter, revenue came in at $7.45 billion versus an anticipated $6.79 billion, while iPad revenue hit $5.55 billion. Analysts were expecting $5.91 billion. Wearables, which includes AirPods, the Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, saw revenue of $7.91 billion. Wall Street was looking for $8.28 billion.\n\nAnother bright spot for Apple in the quarter: Services revenue hit $23.87 billion, up from $20.91 billion last year, an all-time record. Analysts were expecting $23.28 billion.\n\nOn its earnings call, Apple also said it expects current quarter revenue growth to be in the low-single digits. Services revenues are expected to grow double digits, and a rate similar to what the company saw in the first half of its fiscal year.\n\nJPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a client note late Thursday these results are, \"setting up a strong launch pad for the company in relation to results in FY24 as focus turns to the impending AI smartphone upgrade cycle in the coming years.\" JPMorgan maintained its Overweight rating on the stock and raised its price target to $225 per share from $210 following these results. .\n\nApple is also gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, where it will reportedly unveil the latest versions of its iOS, macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. One of the biggest announcements at the show will likely be how Apple will integrate generative AI into its various products.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the company's earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said, \"we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era.\"\n\nIn a note to clients following the report, Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani wrote, \"we think a set of positive catalysts should help drive the stock higher as we go into WWDC where AAPL will provide details around their AI strategy across both hardware and services. We think Apple can deliver AI upside without the AI capex we see elsewhere.\" Evercore maintained its Outperform rating and $220 price target on the stock.\n\nApple may be relatively late to the generative AI party, with rivals across Big Tech already rolling out their own product offerings to consumers and enterprise customers. Still, the company has been busy buying up AI firms and building its own large language model to potentially power its AI efforts.\n\nAnd Maestri told Yahoo Finance that the company is making significant investments in generative AI technologies. Apple is also looking to work with OpenAI, Google, and others to get its AI offerings up to snuff, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "11 stocks that mattered most this earnings season",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is wrapping up its two busiest weeks of earnings reports this quarter, with more than half of the index reporting results. Companies have largely surprised to the upside, with the index pacing at earnings growth of 5.5% this quarter, per Evercore ISI.\n\nStock reactions have been mixed, though, as the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than expected hangs over markets and many companies struggle to impress investors given the market's roaring rally going into the reporting period.\n\nBelow we break down some of the key companies that have reported this season.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 10% on the day following its earnings report despite the company missing Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings per share in the prior quarter. Instead of a fundamentals story, CEO Elon Musk caught investor attention with an announcement that the company would accelerate its launch of a low-cost vehicle.\n\nMusk also emphasized the company's role in the AI world, highlighting that the company will be a leader in autonomous ridesharing.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock soared more than 10% after the company announced its first-ever cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion.\n\nThe company's stock surpassed $2 trillion following the report. Trade fair visitors walk past a Google logo at the Google stand at Hannover Messe 2024. (Photo by Julian Stratenschulte/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nMeta\n\nThe Facebook parent company had a different earnings reaction than its tech counterparts. The stock fell more than 10% after the midpoint of itscurrent quarter revenue guidance range came in light compared to the Street's expectations.\n\nSpending was also a key concern among investors, as Meta (META) said it expects the company's full-year total expenses to come in between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a range of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nAcross all of Big Tech, spending was a large focus of quarterly reports as companies announced plans to increase capital expenditures amid the AI spending rush.\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe coffee chain reported a dismal quarter of financial results, missing Wall Street's estimates across the board. Key metrics that came into focus were an 11% decline in China sales (the Street had been expecting a 1.62% decline) and a 6% decline in foot traffic compared to the 0.27% decline the Street had expected.\n\nStarbucks stock (SBUX) fell almost 16% the next day.\n\nJetBlue\n\nThe low-cost airline carrier announced it expects revenue in the current quarter to fall in a range of 6.5% to 10.5%, potentially more than double analyst estimates of a 3.8% drop. Full-year revenue is expected to fall to the low single digits compared to the prior expectation of flat sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nJetBlue stock (JBLU) tanked in reaction, with shares falling almost 20% in the subsequent trading day.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, AMD, Intel\n\nThe magnitude of AI enthusiasm appeared to weigh on stocks in the chip space. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock, which had been up more than 700% over the last year, sank by double digits after the company reported revenue slightly below Wall Street's estimates for the prior quarter. Notably, Super Micro's revenue guidance for the current quarter, which was in a range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, well above Wall Street's estimates of $4.89 billion, wasn't enough to prevent the stock drop.\n\nHigh expectations plagued others in the AI chip trade too. AMD (AMD) topped Wall Street's expectations for revenue and earnings per share in the current quarter, but investors appeared more concerned that the company's Q2 revenue forecast came in lighter than analyst estimates.\n\nA similar story played out for fellow chipmaker Intel (INTC), whose revenue guidance for the current quarter fell short of Wall Street's expectations.\n\nCarvana\n\nCarvana stock (CVNA) soared more than 30% as the company reported a surprise profit for the prior quarter. The company reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 versus expectations for a loss of $0.80. Revenue came in at $3.06 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $2.76 billion.\n\nSnap, Pinterest\n\nShares of Snap (SNAP) jumped more than 30% after the company issued a more upbeat sales forecast than Wall Street had expected. Pinterest (PINS) also saw a significant stock bump after it topped Wall Street's expectations for adjusted earnings per share and revenue in the prior quarter.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - Google has asked a U.S. judge not to impose sweeping changes to the Alphabet unit's app store Play that were proposed by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games in the companies' closely-watched antitrust fight.\n\nGoogle made its filing late on Thursday in San Francisco federal court, where Epic last year persuaded a jury that the tech giant unlawfully stifled competition with its controls over apps downloads on Android devices and payments to developers for in-app transactions.\n\nEpic's proposal \"would make it nearly impossible for Google to compete,\" Google's filing said.\n\nThe gaming company in March asked U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco to force Google to make it easier for users to download apps from other sources and to allow developers more flexibility in offering and charging for purchases.\n\nThe Cary, North Carolina-based company also said it should be allowed to bring its Epic Games Store to Android \"without delays and barriers.\"\n\nA hearing on the proposed injunction is scheduled for May 23.\n\nEpic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWilson White, Google's head of government affairs and public policy, said in a statement that \"Epic’s demands would harm the privacy, security, and overall experience of consumers, developers, and device manufacturers.\"\n\nIn its filing, Google said a related Play store settlement with states and consumers made Epic's bid for an injunction unnecessary. The remedies in that settlement, Google said, \"fully address\" the alleged anticompetitive conduct Epic presented at trial.\n\nIn December, Google agreed to pay $700 million to resolve the states' case and, among other reforms, will allow more alternative billing options for in-app purchases.\n\nIn another even more far-reaching antitrust case, Google on Thursday squared off for closing trial arguments with the Justice Department and a group of states in a Washington, D.C. courtroom over claims that it unfairly dominates the market for mobile web search.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella in Washington; Editing by David Bario and Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook took time during the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday to drum up excitement for the iPhone maker's upcoming generative AI offerings.\n\nIn his remarks, Cook told listeners that the company is bullish about the opportunities generative AI has to offer and that it is making significant investments in the technology.\n\n\"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration; groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry leading neural engine; and our unwavering focus on privacy,\" Cook said.\n\nAhead of the call, Apple reported better than anticipated earnings and revenue, though iPhone sales fell about 10% year-over-year. Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 15 Pro during an Apple event on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nApple will host its annual WWDC developer conference in June, which should serve as the launchpad for the company's generative AI ambitions. Analysts hope generative AI could kick off another iPhone sales supercycle. But, so far, the technology doesn't appear to be driving sales of competing smartphones from the likes of Samsung and Google.\n\nCook has been relatively tightlipped regarding Apple's generative AI plans, dropping small tidbits about the company's investments here and there. This is one of the first times he's come out so strongly about how Apple will set itself apart from its Big Tech rivals in the generative AI space.\n\nWall Street is waiting on tenterhooks for Apple's generative AI announcements. The company hasn't debuted any generative AI products since the technology exploded in popularity in late-2022.\n\nRivals including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, have rolled out a series of generative AI capabilities and products including chatbots and search engine improvements. Microsoft, in particular, has added generative AI directly to Windows 11 via the Windows 11 Copilot.\n\nIf Apple's generative AI plans are going to live up to Wall Street's expectations, it will need to enable some kind of must-have features that users can't get on their existing devices.

        "title": "Apple beats Q2 estimates, as iPhone sales decline 10%",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday beating expectations on the top and bottom lines, but revenue declined 4% year-over-year on slower iPhone, Mac, iPad, and wearables sales than the same period in 2023.\n\nStill, the company announced it was authorizing an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and increased its dividend to $0.25 per share.\n\nShares of Apple rose 2% following the report.\n\nApple's Greater China revenue slide 8% year-over-year to $16.37 billion, though that was better than the $15.87 billion analysts were expecting. The company's all important iPhone revenue topped out at $45.96 billion, down from $51.33 in Q2 last year.\n\nOverall, Apple reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.53 on revenue of $90.8 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $1.50 on revenue of $90.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nApple is dealing with a one-two combination of a resurgent Huawei and a slowing economy in China, which is cutting into its sales.\n\nThe company's stock is off some 10% year to date and 2% over the last 12 months. Shares of Big Tech rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, are up 30% and 58% over the last year, respectively.\n\nMac revenue came in at $TKTKTK versus an anticipated $6.79 billion, while iPad revenue hit $5.55. Analysts were expecting $5.91 billion. Wearables, which includes AirPods, the Apple Watch, and Vision Pro saw revenue of $7.91. Wall Street was looking for $8.28 billion.\n\nBut there was one bright spot for Apple in the quarter. Services revenue hit $23.86. Analysts were expecting $23.28 billion.\n\nApple is also gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, where it will reportedly unveil the latest versions of its iOS, macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. One of the biggest announcements at the show will likely be how Apple will integrate generative AI into its various products.\n\nThe company is late to the generative AI party, with rivals across Big Tech already rolling out their own product offerings to consumers and enterprise customers. But that doesn’t mean Apple has been twiddling its thumbs. The company has been busy buying up AI firms and building its own large language model to potentially power its AI efforts.\n\nApple is also looking to work with OpenAI, Google, and others to get its AI offerings up to snuff, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nGenerative AI is still a relatively niche product among consumers. Sure, Google and Samsung offer generative AI capabilities on their smartphones, and PC makers are increasingly leaning into so-called AI PCs, but the applications still feel largely like tech demos rather than game-changing features that will significantly drive sales. Apple has the opportunity to change that.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Google Faces Off With US Government as Search Antitrust Trial Closes",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Department of Justice reiterated its argument that Google has broken antitrust laws through exclusive, multi-billion-dollar deals to maintain a dominant position in the market for online search and related advertising.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel Online Turkey Confirms All Trade Halt With Israel Over War in Gaza Huawei Secretly Backs US Research, Awarding Millions in Prizes Biden Calls Ally Japan ‘Xenophobic’ Along With China, Russia In Jamie Dimon's America, the Stock Market Has Already Voted\n\nIn closing arguments for a landmark competition case, the government presented evidence that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads, the government alleged, urging a judge to find the behavior illegal.\n\n“Google uses its hold on the industry” and keeps rivals out, even Apple, Justice Department lawyer Kenneth Dintzer said on Thursday in a federal court in Washington. Those competitors aren’t able to scale the way Google does and don’t have the incentives to invest in the search-engine market, he added. “The fact that they may be happy cashing Google’s checks, doesn’t tell us anything about Google’s conduct.”\n\nThe two-day closing arguments come six months after testimony ended last November. The case is the first antitrust trial pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades. US District Judge Amit Mehta, who is overseeing the case, is expected to issue a decision later this year on whether Google broke the law. If the Justice Department wins, it may demand the separation of Alphabet’s search business from other products, like Android and Chrome, which would mark the biggest forced breakup of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in 1984.\n\nThroughout the 10-week trial last fall, Google argued that it has cornered more than 90% of the global market for search because it has the best product and that people choose to use it over rivals such as Microsoft Corp.’s Bing.\n\n“Google winning contracts because it has a better product is not a harm to the competitive process,” said John Schmidtlein, Google’s lead litigator.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s administration has taken on the Big Tech industry and made promoting competition in commerce central to its economic policy. Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. also face federal and state lawsuits for monopolistic behavior. As the first one to come to trial, after more than a decade in the making, Google’s case is likely to set a precedent for the rest of the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: DOJ’s Google Monopoly Case Explained With Six Key Documents\n\nApple first agreed to use Google in the Safari browser in 2002 for free. But the companies later decided to share revenue made from search advertising. By May 2021, that translated to Google paying Apple more than $1 billion a month for its default status, documents revealed at trial showed. That quickly ballooned and became a significant contributor to Apple’s bottom line. In 2020, Google’s payments to Apple constituted 17.5% of the iPhone maker’s operating income, for example, and by 2022, Google was paying Apple $20 billion for its default status, antitrust enforcers said.\n\nBeing the default search engine gives Google access to more users generating more queries than its rivals, allowing it to improve its algorithms and results and making it even harder for competitors to attract users, Justice Department lawyers said.\n\n“If you don’t have access to distribution, you don’t have access to scale,” Dintzer said on Thursday. “This is the source of Google’s magic.”\n\nGoogle has argued that the payments help support the Android ecosystem, which competes against Apple’s iPhone. And rivals like Microsoft have long paid for their products to be pre-installed and set as the default on computers.\n\nMicrosoft, which faced its own infamous antitrust trial against the US government more than 20 years ago, has repeatedly tried to entice Apple away from its relationship with Google. The company offered to share 90% of its advertising revenue with Apple to make Bing the default in Safari, court documents showed. But Apple didn’t bite, determining there was no price the Windows maker could offer that would get them to change, according to testimony from company executives during the trial.\n\nOn Thursday, Mehta asked whether it would be even possible for a new competitor to ever dislodge Google from the Apple contract. The rival would need billions of dollars to create a new search engine and billions more to ensure that Apple wouldn’t lose the money it gets from Google, he said.\n\n“I can’t conceive of a world in which a new competitor could do that if Microsoft couldn’t do it,” Mehta said.\n\nSchmidtlein said the contracts emerged from a fair competition. “The antitrust laws are not designed to ensure competitive markets. They are designed to ensure a competitive process,” he said.\n\nThe specter of artificial intelligence, which has the potential to change Google’s core search business, also loomed in the background of closing arguments in court.\n\nGoogle’s lawyer sought to portray the government’s case as backward-looking, since search is undergoing a major transformation with the “massive investment going into AI.”\n\nGoogle has been integrating generative AI technology, which can create new text, images or even video based on user prompts, into its products and services, from Gmail to Google Docs. But it has been more deliberate about introducing the technology directly into its flagship search engine, which it risks being cannibalized by AI chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, that can answer general questions in a more conversational tone, rather than providing a list of links to other websites. Google claims that the rapid growth of AI has put it on the defensive in search from rivals like Microsoft, which has invested roughly $13 billion in OpenAI and is infusing its Bing search engine with ChatGPT functionality.\n\nBut Mehta dismissed such challenges as irrelevant to the case at hand. “No one’s saying that a purely AI-driven search engine couldn’t succeed tomorrow,” Mehta said. “What I’m focused on is today.”\n\nIf government lawyers succeed in proving that Google’s agreements violate antitrust laws, the case will move to a second stage aimed at imposing remedies to alleviate any harm caused by the company’s conduct. The judge could rule to break up the company or require Google to share the data its searches generate with rivals to help them improve their search engines. Or, he could absolve the company completely. Closing arguments will continue on Friday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "A 2019 email from Microsoft’s CTO to CEO Satya Nadella and Bill Gates shows how spooked the company was by AI rivals Google and OpenAI",
        "content": "In 2019, Microsoft executives at the highest level had an anxious email exchange about AI that would ultimately kickstart its AI investment.\n\nBack then, chief technology officer Kevin Scott sent a four-page email to CEO Satya Nadella and cofounder Bill Gates with the subject line “thoughts on OpenAI,” which outlined his fears that Microsoft was falling drastically behind in the AI race. At the time, ChatGPT was still more than four years away from being released to the public. But even then, Scott realized OpenAI and Google had made extraordinary steps forward in their work on AI.\n\n“The thing that’s interesting about what OpenAI and DeepMInd and Google Brain are doing is the scale of their ambition,” Scott wrote.\n\nThe email, which is heavily redacted, came to light as part of the Justice Department’s antitrust investigation into Google and was first reported by Business Insider.\n\nThat same year, Microsoft would invest $1 billion in OpenAI, the very company Scott cited in his email. Eventually the tech giant would go on to invest at least another $10 billion into the startup, which is credited for popularizing AI chatbots for everyday use with the launch of ChatGPT. The two companies are now intertwined. Microsoft brings its vast resources, the need for which Scott outlines in his email, while OpenAI brings its cutting-edge AI expertise that had so preoccupied the Microsoft executive.\n\nIn his email, Scott says he miscalculated what exactly Google and OpenAI were trying to accomplish with their AI work. At the time, DeepMind, a startup owned by Google, was trying to build an AI system that could play the Chinese board game Go, which Scott seems to be referencing.\n\n“I was highly dismissive of that,” Scott wrote. “That was a mistake.”\n\nScott marveled at how Google and OpenAI had built an entire infrastructure around their AI push. In the email, he said he was surprised Google and OpenAI had designed data centers, sourced silicon chips, and built programming frameworks to enable all their work, according to the email.\n\n“When they took all of the infrastructure that they had built to build NLP [natural language processing] models that we couldn't easily replicate, I started to take things more seriously,” Scott told Gates and Nadella.\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe advent of AI has made many of those resources in extremely high demand. AI requires extraordinary amounts of computing power to both run and train the models behind chatbots like Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Data centers have become hot properties both as tech investments and as real-estate assets, with some of the biggest investment firms racing to corner the market. Silicon chips, or semiconductors, went through an unprecedented shortage as more and more companies tried to hoard them, fearing they’d run out. Their importance is best exemplified by Nvidia’s legendary stock surge over the past year. AI models also necessitated vast amounts of cloud computing, which companies like Google and Microsoft invested heavily in over the last decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut back in 2019, when he sent the email, Scott realized how important all these infrastructure upgrades were to developing the sort of AI that’s now commonplace. “As I dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training, I got very, very worried,” Scott said.\n\nScott says at the time, it took Microsoft about six months to train one of its AI models because “our infrastructure wasn’t up to the task.”\n\nMicrosoft also realized it was lagging its competitors in terms of the personnel it had dedicated toward machine learning and AI research. Since then, employees well-versed in AI have found no shortage of job offers (some with million-dollar pay packages) from companies eager to hire them. The rush to hire AI talent would eventually spread beyond the tech sector to virtually every industry in the corporate world.\n\nMicrosoft, according to Scott, had some “very smart” machine-learning experts, but they lacked the right resources and headcounts to make a notable dent in deep learning, the complex training mechanisms used to develop AI models. That meant their work took longer than it should have, a worrying prospect amid the imminent AI arms race. “We are multiple years behind the competition in terms of [machine learning] scale,” Scott said.\n\nMeanwhile, Nadella seemed to take Scott’s extensive concerns to heart. Nadella cc’ed chief financial officer Amy Hood and replied: This is “why I want us to do this.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Updates with details from ongoing closing arguments)\n\nWASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta peppered the Justice Department and Alphabet's Google with questions in the first day of closing arguments in the government's antitrust lawsuit against the online search leader.\n\nThe Justice Department hammered away at Google in a trial that started on Sept. 12, arguing the search engine giant is a monopolist and illegally abused its power to favor its bottom line.\n\nThe judge noted that during the trial, Microsoft acknowledged it did not invest enough in mobile search. \"That's not anticompetitive, the fact that Google was smart enough to get on the mobile bandwagon before Microsoft,\" Mehta said.\n\nThe government agreed, but responded that a \"mistake by one rival doesn't mean Google gets to monopolize this market forever.\"\n\nGoogle lawyer John Schmidtlein rejected contentions the company had engaged in anticompetitive conduct.\n\nThis case, filed by the Trump administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in the market power of tech leaders.\n\nThe second, against Facebook parent Meta, was also filed during the Trump administration, while Biden's antitrust enforcers have followed with a second case against Google and cases against Amazon.com and Apple Inc.\n\nIn this non-jury trial, Mehta will weigh whether Google violated the law, and will later look at any punishment if needed.\n\nWitnesses from Verizon, Android maker Samsung Electronics and Google itself testified about the company's annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\nIn his testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the importance of making its search engine the default on phones, tablets and laptops to keep users loyal, saying: \"We definitely see value.\"\n\nIn turn, Google has argued the government was wrong to allege it broke the law to hold onto its massive market share, saying its search engine was wildly popular because of its quality and that dissatisfied users can easily switch.\n\nDespite Google's multibillion-dollar payments and Pichai's statement, Google's lawyers have argued that being the default has limited value and that users will not stick around if they are unhappy.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for both the Department of Justice and Google will present arguments Thursday and Friday to conclude the biggest antitrust case in a quarter century.\n\nIn closing arguments of a Washington, D.C., trial that began last September, regulators will apply the finishing touches to a case alleging Google has turned its search engine into an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and innovation.\n\nRegulators claim that Google competed unfairly when it made lucrative deals with Apple and other companies to automatically lock its search engine into smartphones and web browsers. Meanwhile, Google maintains that consumers use its dominant search engine because it is the best available option.\n\n“Google pays more than $10 billion per year for these privileged positions,’’ argued Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department’s lead litigator, last September. “Google’s contracts ensure that rivals cannot match the search quality ad monetization, especially on phones.\"\n\nPrabhakar Raghavan, Google’s senior vice president for knowledge and information products, said during testimony last October that the company’s success is precarious and said its leadership fears their product could slide into irrelevance with younger internet users as technology evolves. He said the company has been tagged with the disparaging moniker “Grandpa Google” among younger demographics who don’t see it as an interesting product.\n\n“Grandpa Google knows the answers and will help you with homework,” Raghavan said. “But when it comes to doing interesting things, they like to start elsewhere.”\n\nAfter the closing arguments in the Justice Department’s antitrust case against Google wrap up this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his ruling in the late summer or early autumn. If he decides Google broke the law, another trial will determine how to rein in its market power.\n\nThe case against Google mirrors the one brought against Microsoft in many ways, including the existential threat it poses to a renowned tech giant whose products are relied on by billions of people.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google Eliminates 200 Jobs, Moves Roles to India And Mexico As Part Of Cost-Trimming Efforts\n\nThis story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\n\nAs part of a significant cost-cutting strategy, Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) recently eliminated approximately 200 roles from its core team and relocated some positions to India and Mexico. The tech giant also slashed nearly 50 engineering roles stationed at its California headquarters.\n\nAccording to internal documents obtained by CNBC, Google intends to recruit new staff in India and Mexico to fill these vacated roles. The core team, responsible for the development of Google's main products, supervises technical infrastructure, user security, and global IT operations. The team encompasses departments such as IT, Python development, security, and various engineering sectors.\n\nSee Also: How To Create And Manage An Event On WhatsApp\n\nAsim Husain, Vice President of Google Developer Ecosystem, confirmed the layoffs in an email last week, indicating it as the most significant reduction in his team to date. He stated, \"We intend to maintain our current global footprint while also expanding in high-growth global workforce locations so that we can operate closer to our partners and developer communities.\"\n\nA Google spokesperson also informed the New York Post that affected employees have the opportunity to pursue other roles within the company. The primary objective is to streamline operations, reduce bureaucracy, and concentrate on innovative projects and key initiatives.\n\nThe company also made additional cuts last week to the Python, Dart, and Flutter teams, though it refrained from divulging specific numbers.\n\nThese layoffs form part of a series of staff reductions by Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), which has been trimming its workforce since last year. Alphabet has plans to cut approximately 12,000 jobs, constituting about 6% of its staff, due to a downturn in the online advertising market.\n\nRead Next: JPMorgan CEO Commends PM Modi's 'Unbelievable' Toughness In Removing Procedural Hurdles\n\nIf you’d like to stay ahead of the curve on the Indian stock market, sign up for our Ring The Bell newsletter by clicking here.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Google Eliminates 200 Jobs, Moves Roles to India And Mexico As Part Of Cost-Trimming Efforts originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) A Risky Investment?",
        "content": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat Is Alphabet's Net Debt?\n\nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Alphabet had US$11.9b in debt in March 2024; about the same as the year before. But it also has US$108.1b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$96.2b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Alphabet's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Alphabet had liabilities of US$77.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$37.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$108.1b in cash and US$44.6b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$38.1b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nHaving regard to Alphabet's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.03t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, Alphabet boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nOn top of that, Alphabet grew its EBIT by 34% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Alphabet can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Alphabet has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the most recent three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth 80% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\n\nStory continues\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Alphabet has net cash of US$96.2b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And we liked the look of last year's 34% year-on-year EBIT growth. So is Alphabet's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Alphabet's earnings per share history for free.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "content": "WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. government will layout its antitrust case against Alphabet's Google in closing arguments on Thursday, wrapping up a trial in which the online search leader is accused of breaking the law to stay on top.\n\nThe U.S. government has hammered away at Google in a trial that started Sept. 12, arguing Google is a monopolist and illegally abused its power to favor its bottom line.\n\nThis case, filed by the Trump administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in the market power of tech leaders. The second, against Meta, was also filed during the Trump administration, while Biden's antitrust enforcers have followed with a second case against Google and cases against Amazon.com and Apple Inc.\n\nIn the non-jury trial, the judge will weigh whether Google violated the law, and will later look at any punishment if needed.\n\nWitnesses from Verizon, Android maker Samsung Electronics and Google itself testified about the company's annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\nIn his testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the importance of making its search engine the default on phones, tables and laptops to keep users loyal, saying: \"We definitely see value.\"\n\nIn turn Google has argued the government was wrong to allege it broke the law to hold onto its massive market share, saying its search engine was wildly popular because of its quality and that dissatisfied users can easily switch.\n\nFurthermore, despite Google's multibillion-dollar payments and Pichai's statement, Google's lawyers have argued that being the default has limited value and that users will not stick around if they are unhappy.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Magnificent Stocks That Can Crush Nvidia in the Return Column Over the Next 3 Years",
        "content": "Over the last three decades, Wall Street has entertained no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Since the advent of the internet changed the long-term growth trajectory for corporate America, investors have been waiting for the next innovation that would alter the business landscape. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) might just be the unicorn the investment world has been waiting for.\n\nRelying on software and systems for tasks that would normally be assigned to humans gives AI utility in almost every sector and industry of the market. Last year, PwC released a report (\"Sizing the Prize\") which estimated that global consumption-side benefits and productivity gains from AI would translate into a $15.7 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.\n\nFigures like this are why we've witnessed the foundation of the AI revolution, semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), gain nearly $1.9 trillion in market cap in 16 months. But make no mistake about it; tougher sledding lies ahead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThough Nvidia has benefited immensely from AI, it could underperform for years to come\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on January 28), Nvidia recorded $47.5 billion in sales from its Data Center segment, which was a 217% improvement from the prior-year period. The fuel behind this stellar sales improvement is its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become a staple in high-compute data centers. In particular, the H100 is the preferred choice by businesses aiming to train large language models and support generative AI solutions. All of the top cloud-infrastructure service platforms globally are deploying Nvidia's H100s in their AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nExceptionally high demand for Nvidia's scarce AI-GPUs has also led to otherworldly pricing power for the company. Whereas net sales rose 126% for Nvidia in fiscal 2024, its cost of revenue climbed by a far more modest 43%. This gap was almost entirely wedged by Nvidia's superior pricing power on its AI-GPUs.\n\nThese competitive advantages have pushed Nvidia's stock higher by 500% since the start of 2023. However, maintaining these gains could prove difficult, if not impossible, with headwinds mounting.\n\nThe obvious concern is that Nvidia isn't going to be the only fish in the pond. Intel recently unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerated chip, while Advanced Micro Devices is in the process of increasing production of its MI300X GPU. Both of these chips are direct threats to Nvidia's H100 dominance in high-compute data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps the bigger worry lies within. Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) -- are purchasing Nvidia's H100 GPUs as well as developing their own AI-accelerated GPUs. It's evident these four industry titans aim to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace it entirely in the years to come.\n\nFurthermore, there hasn't been a next-big-thing trend or innovation over the last 30 years that didn't endure an early bubble-popping event. Investors have a propensity to overestimate the adoption, uptake, and importance of new innovations, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this historical precedent.\n\nAll signs point to Nvidia stock struggling in the years to come and likely underperforming the broad-market indexes.\n\nThankfully, two time-tested businesses have the catalysts necessary to handily outperform Nvidia in the return column over the next three years. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has crushed the S&P 500 over nearly six decades. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\n\nThe first magnificent stock that shouldn't have any trouble leaving Nvidia in the dust over the next three years has little to do with the AI revolution and everything to do with spotting amazing values hiding in plain sight. I'm talking about conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), which has been led by billionaire CEO Warren Buffett since the mid-1960s.\n\nThough past performance is no guarantee of future results, the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as Buffett has come to be known, has nearly doubled up the average annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 since the mid-1960s. On an aggregate basis, Berkshire has outperformed the S&P 500 by close to 4,900,000 percentage points!\n\nBuffett's recipe for success effectively boils down to three key points: cyclical stocks, dividend stocks, and share repurchases.\n\nWith regard to the former, Buffett and his investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have packed Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio with cyclical businesses -- i.e., companies that ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nWhile Berkshire's brightest minds are well aware that recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they rightly understand that periods of expansion last substantially longer than downturns. With this in mind, they've positioned Berkshire Hathaway's investments and roughly five dozen owned businesses, including insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF, to benefit from long-winded economic expansions.\n\nSecond, the Oracle of Omaha and his team have a penchant for buying shares of companies that pay a regular dividend. Public companies that pay a dividend are usually profitable on a recurring basis and capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks.\n\nMore importantly, dividend stocks have outperformed non payers over the long run. According to a recently updated report from the Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, income stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.17% over the last half-century (1973-2023). By comparison, non-payers generated a more modest annualized return of just 4.27% over the same timeline.\n\nLastly, Warren Buffett is a huge fan of repurchasing his own company's stock. Since the covenants governing buybacks were altered by Berkshire Hathaway's board in July 2018, he's green-lit the purchase of more than $74 billion worth of his company's shares. These buybacks are lifting Berkshire's earnings per share (EPS) and incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of existing shareholders.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe second magnificent stock that can crush Nvidia in the return column over the next three years is one of Nvidia's top customers: Alphabet. Alphabet is the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming site YouTube, cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nMost of Wall Street is buzzing after the cash-rich Alphabet announced its first-ever quarterly dividend ($0.20 per share). Alphabet ended March with a treasure chest that contained $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, so it can certainly afford to pay a dividend without adversely affecting its innovative capacity.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's new dividend isn't the catalyst that'll help it outperform Nvidia through 2027. Rather, it's the company's foundational search engine and rapidly growing cloud segment that'll do the trick.\n\nFor more than a decade, Google has been Alphabet's proverbial money tree. It's practically a monopoly, with a more than 91% share of worldwide internet search in the month of March. In fact, you have to go back more than nine years to find the last time that Google didn't account for at least a 90% share of global internet search. As the clear go-to for businesses wanting to reach consumers with their message(s), Alphabet shouldn't have any trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nBut what's really exciting about Alphabet is the rapid rise of Google Cloud. Cloud-infrastructure service spending is still in its early innings of expansion, and Google Cloud has already grown into the world's No. 3 cloud-infrastructure service platform by aggregate spend (as of September 2023).\n\nMore importantly, cloud margins are considerably more robust than advertising margins, and Google Cloud has been a profitable segment for Alphabet in each of the past five quarters. In short, this segment can meaningfully boost Alphabet's operating cash flow in the years to come.\n\nThe final selling point is that Alphabet is remarkably cheap. Whereas shares of Alphabet can be purchased right now, at a fresh all-time high, for less than 15 times estimated cash flow in 2025 -- a 17% discount to its average multiple-to-cash flow over the trailing-five-year period -- Nvidia is valued at nearly 28 times forecast cash flow in its upcoming year.\n\nThe table is set for Alphabet to handily outperform Nvidia over the coming three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. paid Apple Inc. $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the default search engine in the Safari browser, according to newly unsealed court documents in the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market US and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East NYPD Arrests Over 300 Protesters in Crackdown on College Campuses The Ozempic Effect: How a Weight Loss Wonder Drug Gobbled Up an Entire Economy Treasuries Rally With Fed Not as Hawkish as Feared: Markets Wrap\n\nThe deal between the two tech giants is at the heart of the landmark case, in which antitrust enforcers allege Google has illegally monopolized the market for online search and related advertising. The Justice Department and Google will offer closing arguments in the case Thursday and Friday, with a decision expected later this year.\n\nGoogle and Apple had hoped to shield the payment amount from public disclosure. At the trial last fall, Apple executives testified that Google paid “billions,” without specifying a number. A Google witness later accidentally disclosed that Google pays 36% of the revenue it earns from search ads to Apple.\n\nCourt documents filed late Tuesday ahead of the closing arguments mark the first public confirmation of the figures by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. Such numbers aren’t disclosed by either company in their securities filings. The documents also revealed the importance of the payments to Apple’s bottom line. For instance, in 2020, Google’s payments to Apple constituted 17.5% of the iPhone maker’s operating income.\n\nThe agreement with Apple is the most important of Google’s default deals, since it sets the search engine for the most used smartphone in the US.\n\nApple first agreed to use Google in the Safari browser in 2002 for free. But the companies later decided to share revenue made from search advertising. By May 2021, that translated to Google paying Apple more than $1 billion a month for its default status, prosecutors said in the filing.\n\nMicrosoft Corp., which operates competing search engine Bing, has repeatedly tried to entice Apple away from its relationship with Google. The company offered to share 90% of its advertising revenue with Apple to make Bing the default in Safari, according to the court documents. Those figures also weren’t previously disclosed.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella testified at the trial last year that the company was willing to make a number of concessions, including hiding the Bing brand, to persuade Apple to make the switch, which he said would be “game changing.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Whomever they choose, they king-make,” Nadella said of Apple.\n\n--With assistance from Davey Alba, Mark Gurman and Dina Bass.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "Apple to report Q2 earnings amid iPhone slowdown, China troubles",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, as Wall Street braces for what is the potential of be a sizable drop in iPhone sales out of China. According to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales fell 19% in the quarter, while rival Huawei continued to regain its footing after the U.S. attempted to kneecap the company by keeping it from accessing US chips in 2019.\n\nThe anticipated pullback in iPhone shipments follows back-to-back quarters of revenue declines out of Greater China, one of Apple’s most important sales regions. For Q2, revenue is set to drop 28% year-over-year.\n\nShares of Apple are off some 5% year to date and roughly flat over the last 12 months. Shares of Big Tech rivals like Microsoft and Google, meanwhile, are up 25% and 37% over the last year, respectively.\n\nFor the quarter, Apple is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 on revenue of $90.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to a 4.75% year-over-year revenue decline.\n\nApple’s iPhone revenue is anticipated to drop some 10.8% to $45.75 billion in the quarter, while iPad revenue is set to fall 11%. Analysts also anticipate both Mac and Wearables to decline 5% year-over-year.\n\n“At this point, expectations are pretty darn low,” Dan Niles, founder of Niles Investment Management told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\n“Competition from China isn’t going away, they’re late to AI, and unfortunately, you’re paying a pretty high PE multiple at 25 times for a company whose March quarter revenues they guided to is exactly the same as three years ago,” he added. Apple CEO Tim Cook will update Wall Street about the state of the company during its Q2 earnings call after the bell Thursday.

Services revenue is expected to grow 11% year-over-year to $23.28 billion. Analysts also anticipate gross margin will improve 5% year-over-year to 46.59%.\n\nApple is also gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June where it will reportedly unveil the latest versions of its iOS, macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. One of the biggest announcements at the show will likely be how Apple will integrate generative AI into its various products.\n\nThe company is late to the generative AI party, with rivals across Big Tech already rolling out their own product offerings to consumers and enterprise customers. But that doesn’t mean Apple has been twiddling its thumbs. The company has been busy buying up AI firms and building its own large language model to potentially power its AI efforts.\n\nApple is also looking to work with OpenAI, Google, and others to get its AI offerings up to snuff, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI is still a relatively niche product among consumers. Sure, Google and Samsung offer generative AI capabilities on their smartphones, and PC makers are increasingly leaning into so-called AI PCs, but the applications still feel largely like tech demos rather than game-changing features that will significantly drive sales. Apple has the opportunity to change that.\n\nBut first it needs to get through earnings. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), and London Stock Exchange Group saw increased investments from Third Point LLC due to their AI-driven opportunities.\n\nDaniel Loeb, founder and CEO, highlighted its significant distribution and technological edge over competitors. In his investor letter, Loeb praised Alphabet’s ability to leverage AI to improve and monetize its product suite.\n\nAdditionally, Third Point increased its stakes in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and London Stock Exchange Group, which were attracted by AI-driven opportunities, Bloomberg reports.\n\nDespite underperforming the broader market, with a 7.8% gain compared to the S&P 500’s nearly 11% return, Third Point’s flagship fund reported solid results for the first quarter, buoyed by strong performances from major tech stocks such as Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nLoeb noted that the technological shift favors established companies investing heavily to dominate the AI landscape.\n\nThis trend was mirrored by other hedge funds like David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital, which also fell short of the S&P 500 with a 4.9% return.\n\nLast week, Alphabet reported first-quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year to $80.539 billion, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $78.594 billion.

        "title": "AI investments are showing signs of a payoff, but the price is steep",
        "content": "Tech earnings season is in full swing, and while a handful of notable players still need to report, namely Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), there’s one key throughline running through the announcements so far: It’s taking a lot of money to make money on AI.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), four of tech’s biggest AI players, have each called out AI sales growth, though without many specifics, while pointing to increased spending on capital expenditures to meet AI demand.\n\nMicrosoft announced last week it spent $14 billion on capital expenditures tied to its AI buildout in its fiscal third quarter, up from $7.8 billion in the same period last year. The company’s 2024 capital expenditures have already eclipsed its spending across all of 2023, and there’s still another quarter left in its fiscal year.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet said it spent $12 billion in the last quarter and will continue at that pace for the rest of the year. Meta similarly said it’s cranking up spending for the full year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion. And CFO Susan Li said that number will increase in the year ahead as well.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Amazon said it would blow past last year’s $48.4 billion in capital expenditures, saying the $14 billion it spent in Q1 will be the low for the year.\n\nThose are mountains of cash. And while there are early signs that AI is driving revenue growth, it’ll take time before it truly makes an impact on companies’ bottom lines.\n\n“I'm thinking it's a 12- to 18-month investment period before we start to see a lot of this really pay off big time,” TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\nTesting the AI waters\n\nGenerative AI is still a relatively new technology. Sure, it blew up in 2023, but corporations are slow-moving entities, and many are only starting to try out generative AI applications across their business segments.\n\n“If I sign up for Microsoft 365 with Microsoft, do I sign up all of my 100,000 employees or do I sign up 500 to check it out?” O’Donnell asked, adding that companies are starting out with a smaller number of signups to get a sense of how they can best use AI applications on the job before signing up the rest of their employees.\n\nThat’s not necessarily a bad thing for tech companies. During its earnings call last week, Microsoft said AI accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth in its Azure and other cloud services business. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter and 3 percentage points in the quarter before that. In Q4 last year, the company said AI drove 1 percentage point of growth in Azure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while it might seem like growth is falling off precipitously, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said it was more the result of a lack of available AI capacity. In other words, Microsoft didn’t have the resources needed to meet customer demand.\n\nGoogle CFO Ruth Porat noted a similar increase in AI sales during her company’s earnings call, saying that Google’s Cloud Platform saw increasing revenue contributions from AI, though she didn’t provide an exact number.\n\nFor Amazon’s part, CFO Brian Olsavsky said customers continue to sign up for larger and longer deal commitments for Amazon Web Services, with many adding generative AI components.\n\nSpending won’t slow down anytime soon\n\nIt might take a year or more to start seeing AI-based revenue growth truly take off, but that doesn’t mean companies are going to ease up on spending. According to Forrester analyst Rowan Curran, companies have been pouring money into AI technologies for years; generative AI has just supercharged that spending.\n\n“We saw a huge growth and investment over the past … year and 18 months, but this has been a continuous increase over the past, I would say, eight or 10 years,” he said. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg presents new devices and AI offerings at the Meta Connect developer conference. (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nAnd tech companies are preparing investors for the long road ahead. During Meta’s earnings call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to assuage concerns that the social media giant will need to plow cash into its AI efforts, though it largely fell on deaf ears, as shares tumbled 14% the morning after the announcement.\n\nHood, meanwhile, said that Microsoft will continue to push AI spending, with levels likely to be the same as those in the company’s fiscal 2025 as they’ve been throughout its fiscal 2024.\n\nOlsavsky offered a similar outlook for Amazon, saying that the company will plow money into generative AI services.\n\n“We will be meaningfully stepping up our capex and the majority of that will be … to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts,” he said during the company’s earnings call.\n\nNow companies just have to prove all of that spending is paying off and provide the numbers to match.

It also maintains backups across its server farms in regions including Taiwan and Singapore.\n\nThe move is part of Alibaba’s strategy to ensure better security and control over its data and potentially reduce costs and liability issues associated with multi-company data management.\n\nCompanies including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) have reached out to Vietnam to diversify their supply chain base amid heightening geopolitical tensions between the US and China.\n\nLam Research weighed the supply chain shift to Vietnam, with the Vietnamese government canvassing the former to commit $1 billion to local production efforts.\n\nApple suppliers in Vietnam increased by 40% to 35 in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia tapped Vietnamese tech firms for AI development.\n\nAlibaba stock lost over 11% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Alphabet (GOOG)",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 32.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 30%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.4%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

        "title": "Anthropic releases business chatbot in hunt for corporate dollars",
        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\n(Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic launched a version of its latest chatbot technology aimed at businesses on Wednesday, jumping into the race to capture corporate dollars.\n\nThe San Francisco-based firm, backed by Alphabet and Amazon.com, in March released a family of artificial intelligence models called Claude 3 that it says outperforms those from rivals such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google.\n\nOn Wednesday, it released an app for Apple's iPhones that will offer Claude 3 to businesses at a rate of $30 per user per month. They can sign up for a plan with a minimum of 5 users.\n\nThe move sets up more direct competition with OpenAI, which is also selling a plan aimed at businesses at the same rate. But Anthropic's new enterprise technology push could also bring it into competition with its backers Google and Amazon, who also want to capture business spending on AI.\n\nSuch tensions are already arising elsewhere in the booming AI sector. Reuters reported last month that OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman pitched his firm's business offering directly to some of Microsoft's biggest customers.\n\nOne of Claude 3's biggest features is the ability ingest a lot of data - about the length of two books - and summarize it, analyze it or pull out a single piece of data accurately. Anthropic said it can be used by finance teams to generate investment reports, engineering teams working on large bases of code or sales teams collaborating on how to land a large client.\n\n\"Claude is particularly good at a combination of structured and unstructured data,\" Daniela Amodei, Anthropic's president, said in an interview.\n\n\"So you can upload a chart, a set of documents, like a PDF, some like Slack exchanges and say, 'Hey, all of these are talking about an upcoming product launch or recent earnings report. Can you summarize all of them for me, Claude, and give me the key highlights or pieces of information?' And Claude can do that.\"\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Michael Erman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon's Smashing Q1 Financials Show The Power Of A Good And Well Executed Strategy\n\nLike Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL),  Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with stronger than expected revenue being the result of the improvements on the ad business front.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nIn part due to its booming AWS division and its advertising service, Amazon reported revenue grew 12.52% YoY to $143.3 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $142.5 billion. Operating income far outpaced revenue growth as well as it soared more than 200% to $15.3 billion, which is the first sign that Amazon’s cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are benefiting the bottom line as net income skyrocketed 229% YoY to $10.43 billion, with diluted EPS amounting to 98 cents a share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 83 cents.\n\nAmazon’s businesses are thriving, beginning with party seller services that cover commissions that Amazon collects, along with fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew 16% YoY to $34.5 billion.\n\nAWS continues to grow and challenge Google and Microsoft, both the cloud and AI front.\n\nThe AWS division reported a 17% YoY growth to $25 billion, surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $24.5 billion and reflecting Amazon’s strong positioning compared to its AI rivals, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), who secured a leadership position with its early entry and OpenAI acquisition, and Alphabet, with the latter finally catching up to its peers in their efforts to lead the way into the golden age of AI.\n\nAWS’ actions could spell trouble for Alphabet and Microsoft as Jassy revealed significant investments over the next few years to build new infrastructure and data centers. Amazon will be investing $5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia and $5 billion in Mexico to build new infrastructure centers, along with $10 billion in Mississippi to build two data centers that are projected to create at least 1,000 jobs.\n\nAdvertising continues to grow, becoming an increasingly important profit driver.\n\nAdvertising revenue grew 24% to $11.8 billion, outpacing both retail and cloud computing growth, as well as StreetAccount’s estimate of $11.7 billion. This is the first report since Amazon introduced ads in Prime Video, which analysts expect to generate significant revenue over time. Despite being new to the ad business, Amazon has emerged as one of the big players in the online advertising arena. CEO Andy Jassy has made it clear that the e-commerce and cloud titan will continue to focus on its ad efforts, as it plans include more of its sponsored content on its Prime Video platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst quarter results across the board show that online ads have rebounded. Last week, Alphabet also announced its ad business reaccelerated after a tough 2022 and 2023. Google reported total ad sales rose from last year’s comparable quarter, when they amounted to $54.55 billion, to $61.66 billion.\n\nSecond Quarter Outlook\n\nAmazon expects profitability growth to continue in the current quarter but at a more measured pace as it guided for an operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, on the back of revenue in the range between $144 billion to $149 billion, translating to revenue growth in the range between 7% and 11%.\n\nAmazon’s disciplined focus on efficiency is showing results.\n\nCost-cutting across the board, fulfillment operations tweaks and stabilization of cloud spending all partially contributed to the earnings growth as Amazon focused to grow its most profitable services, including advertising, cloud computing, Prime memberships and its third-party marketplace.\n\nAmazon continues to stand out among its Big Tech peers as it is yet to implement a quarterly dividend. In February, Meta announced its first dividend at 50 cents a share. Last week, Alphabet followed the footsteps of Meta as it announced its first ever dividend of 20 cents a share.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Top 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 technology companies in Silicon Valley. If you want to skip our coverage of the world's technology hub and a region that has changed the world as we know it, then check out 5 Top Tech Companies in Silicon Valley.\n\nIf there's one thing that 2024 has made sure it's that Silicon Valley isn't going anywhere. The sector that gave us the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone is now leading the charge with a set of technologies called artificial intelligence. Typically the domain of science fiction, AI is a collection of techniques that fall under the category of data science. It is the most advanced kind of data science there is, as the software is programmed to learn from voluminous data sets to generate and create insights of its own.\n\nThe close of the first quarter of 2024 also provided Wall Street the ability to take stock of where some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most of which are in Silicon Valley, are when it comes to artificial intelligence. Big ticket technology and AI companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) report their earnings for the first quarter of 2024. These results primarily focused on the costs that the companies had incurred for their AI platforms in Q1 and also their plans for further spending this year.\n\nOne of the first firms to report its earnings was the Facebook parent Meta. Its shares tanked by 16% in aftermarket hours on the day of the earnings report, as Wall Street digested a multi billion dollar AI capital expenditure plan for 2024 and saw costs grow for the first time after two consecutive quarters. Alphabet sought to assure investors of its stability, as it became yet another technology stock to declare a dividend. An additional source of income is almost always welcomed by investors, and Alphabet's shares soared by more than 10% in aftermarket, even as its peer Microsoft demonstrated mixed share price performance despite being one of the strongest performers on the artificial intelligence front.\n\nDelving deeper into Silicon Valley giant Alphabet's earnings, the firm known for being Google's parent, announced a 20 cent dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback. Both of these are great for helping the share price, and since its earnings report, Alphabet's stock is by 6% after shedding some of its 10% gains in post earnings gains during regular trading hours. On the revenue front, Alphabet brought in $80 billion while it raked in $1.81 on the EPS front. Both of these beat analyst estimates that had stood at $78.59 billion and $1.59, and coupled with $61.7 billion in advertising revenue that surged past estimates of $60.2 billion meant that the latest set of results was rather well rounded.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the hardware side of things, Intel, which is one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is currently focusing on the leading edge side of the industry. The firm has lost its chip manufacturing race to the Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and in April 2024, it announced the 'first light' for the world's most advanced chip making machine, a high NA EUV scanner. First light refers to the first time that a chip making machine is turned on, and the event typically marks the end of countless hours of work spent in setting up the complex machines.\n\nAs for AI, here's what the management of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), another Silicon Valley firm, had to say during its Q1 2024 earnings:\n\nWe’re bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we are already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We are driving strong usage, value and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top technology companies in Silicon Valley.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. expanded the team responsible for ensuring its artificial intelligence products are safe, boosting personnel from 350 to 400 last year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East Tesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market NYPD Arrests Over 300 Protesters in Crackdown on College Campuses The Ozempic Effect: How a Weight Loss Wonder Drug Gobbled Up an Entire Economy Treasuries Rally With Fed Not as Hawkish as Feared: Markets Wrap\n\nMore than half of the group focuses on the task full-time, the company said Wednesday in its first annual AI transparency report, which outlines measures to ensure its services are rolled out responsibly. The team’s additional members include new hires as well as existing employees.\n\nLast year, Microsoft dissolved its Ethics and Society team amid broader layoffs across the technology sector that gutted trust and safety teams at various companies, including Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nMicrosoft is keen to boost trust in its generative AI tools amid mounting concerns about their tendency to generate strange content. In February, the company investigated incidents involving its Copilot chatbot, whose responses ranged from weird to harmful.\n\nThe following month, a Microsoft software engineer sent letters to the board, lawmakers and the Federal Trade Commission warning that the tech giant wasn’t doing enough to safeguard its AI image generation tool, Copilot Designer, from creating abusive and violent content.\n\n“At Microsoft, we recognize our role in shaping this technology,” the Redmond, Washington-based company said in the report.\n\nMicrosoft’s approach to deploying AI safely is based on a framework devised by the National Institute for Standards and Technology. The agency, which is part of the Department of Commerce, was tasked with creating standards for the emerging technology as part of an executive order issued last year by President Joe Biden.\n\nIn its inaugural report, Microsoft said it has rolled out 30 responsible AI tools, including ones that make it harder for people to trick AI chatbots into acting bizarrely. The company’s “prompt shields” are designed to detect and block deliberate attempts — also known as prompt injection attacks or jailbreaks — to make an AI model behave in an unintended way.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. nVent Electric (NVT) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.75 a share, just two days from its upcoming earnings release on May 3, 2024.\n\nnVent Electric's Earnings ESP sits at 2.04%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.75 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.73.\n\nNVT is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet, which is readying to report earnings on July 23, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.86 a share, and GOOGL is 83 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alphabet is $1.84, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.88%.\n\nNVT and GOOGL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Here's My Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock, and It's Not Nvidia",
        "content": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has skyrocketed over the last year, attracting businesses and consumers from dozens of industries. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reinvigorated the AI market and forced the public to rethink what was currently possible with the generative technology.\n\nIn the last 12 months, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index has risen 55%, with much of that growth owed to Nvidia. The chipmaker's business exploded alongside a boom in AI. Its stock has climbed 234% since last April as AI chip demand has increased, leading to soaring earnings for the company.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia has become a poster child of sorts for the rally in AI. However, with numerous companies joining the market, there are potentially better investment options and ways to back the budding industry.\n\nSo, here's why Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is my favorite AI stock right now, even over Nvidia.\n\nBeginning to see returns on its heavy investment in AI\n\nAlphabet is no stranger to AI, with CEO Sundar Pichai describing the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company.\" However, like many tech firms, Alphabet recently placed a stronger focus on the industry.\n\nSince last year, the company launched its most powerful AI model, Gemini, introduced a range of new AI tools on its cloud platform, Google Cloud, and began incorporating the technology into services across its product lineup.\n\nAlphabet posted its first quarter of 2024 earnings on April 25, leading its shares to jump 14% in the hours following. The company welcomed revenue gains of 15% year over year, outperforming estimates by nearly $2 billion.\n\nAlphabet's quarter beat on multiple fronts, with earnings per share hitting $1.89 against expectations of $1.51. Meanwhile, YouTube advertising revenue came in at more than $8 billion when analysts projected $7.7 billion.\n\nHowever, the most promising beat came from Alphabet's AI-focused Google Cloud segment, which posted revenue growth of 28% year over year to $9.6 billion. Wall Street had forecast $9.3 billion for Alphabet's cloud business.\n\nInvestors rallied over Alphabet's stock, with signs that the company is beginning to see a return on its investment in AI. Businesses worldwide are increasingly utilizing the Google company's generative AI tools and cloud infrastructure to boost efficiency in their operations.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet has multiple use cases of AI thanks to the vast user base it has built up with platforms like YouTube, Chrome, Android, and the many services under Google. The company likely has a bright future in AI, and you won't want to miss out.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet announces its first-ever dividend\n\nIn addition to excitement over its outlook in AI, Alphabet rallied investors this week with the surprise announcement of its first-ever dividend. The cash amount will be $0.20 per share, revealed alongside plans to repurchase up to an additional $70 billion in stock.\n\nThe dividend represents a vote of confidence from Alphabet's board of directors about the company's direction and financial future. Management clearly believes in the company's path and ability to continue paying dividends for the foreseeable future. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMoreover, Alphabet's stock is one of the best bargains in AI. The charts above show that it has the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow out of some of the biggest names in the industry.\n\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated earnings per share, while price-to-free cash flow divides its market cap by its free cash flow. These are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as investors consider a company's financials. With both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAnd in this case, Alphabet is one of the best-valued stocks in AI. With glowing earnings, an exciting outlook in AI, and a potent position in tech, Alphabet's stock is worth considering investing in right now before it's too late.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nStocks tumbled into the close on Tuesday, a fitting end to the year's most challenging month for investors.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 4% while the Dow (^DJI) lost 4.5%, marking its worst month since September 2022.\n\nAnd much of this reversal was driven by the winners who got us here in the first place.\n\nThe three US stocks with the biggest market cap gains in the first three months of the year — Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) — suffered the biggest losses to their market caps in April.\n\nNvidia was up a cool $1 trillion in market cap as of the final trading day of March, of which it gave up over $85 billion in April — the third-biggest such loss in the S&P 500.\n\nMicrosoft, the first quarter's silver medalist, added over $330 billion. But it subsequently lost over $210 billion in April.\n\nThen there's Meta Platforms, which turned in a similar performance to Microsoft, gaining nearly $330 billion through March before losing just over $140 billionin April.\n\nApril had its share of winners, too, with these names also marking a reversal from what predominated in the year's first quarter.\n\nTesla (TSLA) gained over $25 billion in April, putting it in second place for the month after coming in next-to-last in the first quarter with a loss of $230 billion.\n\nApple (AAPL) was sitting dead last among US stocks at the end of March with a year-to-date market cap loss of nearly $350 billion. After the close on Monday, it had gained over $30 billion in value over April, but a day later — at month-end — that gain had dwindled to $2 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) took first prize, gaining nearly $150 billion in the month. All of this and more came the day after it reported first quarter earnings last week, logging a 10% gain, which was good for $197 billion of market cap.\n\nThese big names also demonstrate how moves across sectors showed similar trends of reversion, with gains and losses swapping places.\n\nInformation Technology (XLK) — the home of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple — was the No. 1 large-cap gainer in market cap through March, rising $1.5 trillion. It was also the biggest loser in April, falling over $650 billion.\n\nCommunications Services (XLC) — home of Alphabet and Meta — was third in first quarter gains, adding $570 billion in market cap. It fell to the middle of the pack when it comes to April losses, losing nearly $100 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY) — home of Amazon and Tesla — was dead last among sectors in the first three months of the year, only to drop $180 billion in April.\n\nNotable April losses also include Financials (XLF), down $275 billion, and Health Care (XLV), which lost over $280 billion.\n\nThe only sector to gain in April was Utilities (XLU), which has also been the biggest laggard of this bull market that began in October of 2022.\n\nApril's plot twists still appear to be corrections, rather than shifts, in the narrative. Meta, for instance, may have lost well over $140 billion in value over the month of April, but shareholders are still sitting on annual gains of over 20%.\n\nTuesday's rocky close comes right as the proverbial \"sell in May and go away\" headlines are set to trigger.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Sales Could Soar 820% by 2030: 2 Amazing AI Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Long-Term",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) sale across hardware, software, and services totaled about $196 billion last year, according to Grand View Research. But analysts expect that figure to surge 820% by 2030, such that annual AI spending exceeds $1.8 trillion at the end of the decade. Investors hoping to benefit should be positioning their portfolios today, and they should be diversifying beyond Nvidia.\n\nWith that in mind, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG) stand out as worthwhile long-term investments. The companies have strong footholds in relevant markets, and the stocks trade reasonable valuations compared to future growth prospects.\n\nHere's what you should know.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet reported first-quarter financial results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 15% to $80.5 billion on especially strong momentum in Google Cloud, the segment comprising cloud infrastructure and platform services, as well as the Google Workspace applications. Meanwhile, GAAP net income soared 61% to $1.89 per diluted share because of disciplined cost control, something management continues to prioritize.\n\nThe investment thesis for Alphabet is simple. Its Google subsidiary has a strong presence in two growing markets, digital advertising and cloud computing, and the company is using its artificial intelligence (AI) expertise to create new monetization opportunities within those markets.\n\nTo elaborate, Google is the largest digital advertiser in the world. Its market share is declining because of competition from Amazon and others ad tech companies. However, Google is still expected to account for 27% of digital ad spending next year, and it could recapture lost market share with help from artificial intelligence. For instance, Google is using generative AI to improve the search experience for internet users and streamline the creation of advertising campaigns for media buyers. Management says the initial feedback is positive.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud Platform is the third-largest cloud services provider. Here, the company has gained 3 points of market share over the last four years, such that it accounted for 11% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the fourth quarter. Investments in AI product development (like Gemini) could help the company maintain that momentum. CEO Sundar Pichai hinted at that during the latest earnings call, noting that 90% of generative AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\n\nGoing forward, the online advertising and cloud computing markets are forecasted to expand at annual rates of 16% and 14%, respectively, through 2030. Wall Street expects Alphabet to grow sales at 10.5% annually over the next five years, but I think the company could surprise analysts to the upside given the secular tailwinds behind its business. In that context, its current valuation of 7 times sales appears reasonable.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Datadog\n\nDatadog reported fourth-quarter results that beat what Wall Street expected. Revenue rose 26% to $590 million and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to reach $0.44 per diluted share. But the stock still slipped following the report because of a disappointing outlook. Specifically, management estimated that non-GAAP earnings would increase 21% in the first quarter, but Wall Street expected 39% growth. Even so, the investment thesis remains intact.\n\nDatadog sells observability and security software that helps businesses monitor the performance of IT infrastructure and applications. Its platform incorporates artificial intelligence to hasten problem resolution, and it integrates 19 products to support vendor consolidation. In other words, businesses need not deploy point products from different vendors; they can choose the more efficient path of getting their observability software through one platform.\n\nDatadog's platform strategy and product innovation have won praise from analysts. The company has been recognized as a leader in several observability software verticals, including application performance monitoring and AI for IT operations. It also has a strong position in the server monitoring, cloud infrastructure monitoring, and database monitoring markets. Finally, Datadog ranked second on the 2023 Fortune Future 50 list, an annual report that scores the largest companies in the world based on long-term growth prospects.\n\nGoing forward, demand for observability software should increase as IT environments become more complex. That means technology shifts like cloud computing and artificial intelligence should be major tailwinds for Datadog. Indeed, the company said adoption of AI integrations jumped 75% sequentially in the fourth quarter, meaning customers are rapidly deploying Datadog software to monitor large language models and generative AI applications.\n\nLast year, Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research said the rise of generative AI could make Datadog \"the fastest growing software company,\" and Sanjit Singh at Morgan Stanley selected Datadog as one of the software companies best positioned to monetize generative AI. As for the rest of Wall Street, analysts expect Datadog to grow sales at 25% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 21.6 times sales look reasonable. Patient investors should feel confident in buying a small position in this growth stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "My 5 Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "It's easy to get swept up in the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Some of the predictions experts are making won't come true. On the other hand, they could be underestimating the changes AI could bring in some ways. That's how it's always been in the early days of a game-changing technology.\n\nMake no mistake, though: AI is a game-changing technology. And it presents what almost certainly is a once-in-a-generation investing opportunity. There are many good choices for investors, but a few especially stand out. Here are my five favorite AI stocks to buy in May, listed alphabetically.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nUnderestimate Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) at your peril. Sure, the company has had a few missteps with its launches of generative AI models. However, Alphabet remains one of the leading innovators in AI with a boatload of cash to invest in research and development.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai boasted recently that Google has \"the best infrastructure for the AI era.\" While that's debatable, he could be right. Thanks to the AI explosion, Google Cloud is unquestionably well-positioned to deliver tremendous growth.\n\nBut could AI render Google Search obsolete? I don't think so. Pichai noted that Google's testing has found increased search usage and higher user satisfaction among people who use its new AI overviews. He stated the company has \"clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud as well as subscriptions.\" I agree.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is another AI pioneer with plenty of room to run. Some might have thought the company would be left behind in the AI race after OpenAI took the world by storm with ChatGPT. If so, they were proved wrong.\n\nLast year, Amazon rolled out wave after wave of new AI technology. As a result, Amazon Web Services (AWS) appears to be in a strong position to maintain its position at the top of the cloud services market. As more AI apps are deployed in the cloud, AWS should grow much larger.\n\nAmazon is also using AI to improve its internal efficiency and help customers. I expect these efforts will continue to show up on the company's bottom line.\n\nFounder Jeff Bezos instilled the mindset that it's always \"day one\" at Amazon (i.e., the company will always think and act like a start-up). With AI, it really is \"day one\" at Amazon.\n\n3. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) might be the most surprising pick on this list. The chipmaker has lost the mojo it once had, losing market share to rivals with less expensive solutions and missing out on the GPU boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, I predict Intel will make a big comeback. The company at long last has some of its swagger back. Intel recently introduced a new AI chip to compete head-to-head with Nvidia, the industry's 800-pound gorilla.\n\nIntel's shares trade at a super-low price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.5, according to LSEG. Even if analysts' growth projections incorporated into this valuation metric are way off, Intel is one of the cheapest AI stocks on the market.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nInvestors bailed on Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) after the company's recent first-quarter update. Meta didn't report disappointing numbers; its revenue and earnings looked great. Instead, the company's projection of higher expenses due to AI and metaverse investments and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's focus in the earnings call on these current money-losing initiatives caused the sell-off.\n\nI think this negative reaction to Meta's update was short-sighted. Zuckerberg mentioned in the Q1 call that the company has experienced significant volatility in the past when it was still in the early stages of investing in new technology. He noted, though, that investors who didn't throw in the towel were rewarded over the long term. I suspect we'll see this pattern play out with Meta's investments in AI and the metaverse.\n\nLike Alphabet and Amazon, Meta is using AI to boost the monetization of its social media platform. The company is also integrating AI into business messaging and smart glasses. I view Meta as a potential sleeping giant (that's really not sleeping) in the AI world.\n\n5. UiPath\n\nI'm not completely biased toward huge AI stocks. UiPath's (NYSE: PATH) market cap is only around $11 billion. This relatively small size is an advantage, in my view.\n\nUiPath is a leader in robotic process automation software. It uses AI extensively throughout its platform. One of the company's AI products even ranked among Time's Best Inventions of 2023.\n\nSince mid-2022, UiPath's annualized revenue run rate has increased by a compound annual growth rate of 32%. The company achieved profitability in its latest quarter. Even though it's been in business for nearly 20 years, UiPath is still only in its early innings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Following Alphabet’s GOOGLblowout first quarter results last week, and the announcement of its first-ever dividend, now appears to be a promising time to invest in the Magnificent Seven titan.\n\nTo that point, Alphabet’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is the Bull of the Day as earnings estimate revisions have soared for the cloud and search engine provider.\n\nStrong Performance Overview: Alphabet’s strong Q1 results were attributed to Google Search, Cloud, and stronger advertising growth on YouTube. Alphabet also emphasized that it is well-positioned for the next wave of artificial intelligence through its platform Gemini which is a generative AI multimodal with understanding across audio, video, and text code.\n\nThis has now led to a +17% year-to-date surge in Alphabet’s stock which has impressively topped the S&P 500’s +8% and the Nasdaq’s +4%. Furthermore, GOOGL has noticeably outperformed the broader indexes over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSoaring EPS Estimates\n\nEarnings estimates for Alphabet’s fiscal 2024 and FY25 have soared in the last week after the tech giant reported Q1 earnings of $1.89 per share which increased 61% year over year and crushed the Zacks Consensus of $1.49 a share by 27%.\n\nLargely attributing to Alphabet’s strong buy rating is that FY24 earnings estimate revisions have risen 10% since the company’s exhilarating Q1 report from estimates of $6.79 a share to $7.49 per share. Plus, FY25 EPS estimates are up 10% in that last week as well, rising from projections of $7.78 a share to $8.61 per share.\n\nAlphabet’s annual earnings are now projected to rise 29% this year with another 15% EPS growth expected in FY25. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMagnificent Seven Value\n\nAdding value to shareholders and peaking their optimism, Alphabet announced a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share with the first payout set for June 17 to shareholders on record as of June 10. Notably, five of the Magnificent Seven stocks now offer dividends with Alphabet joining Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and Meta Platforms META in this regard.\n\nHowever, what also stands out about Alphabet is that outside of Meta Platforms, it is the most reasonably valued of the Mag Seven in terms of P/E valuation at 24.3X forward earnings and close to the S&P 500’s 21.5X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlphabet continues to rightfully retain its title as a “Magnificent Seven” stock that has significantly boosted the market’s returns in recent years and is one the most appealing technology-driven companies to invest in at the moment.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik\n\n(Reuters) - Three of the Wall Street's heavyweight technology firms have reported better-than-expected sales at their cloud computing units in recent days, as interest in artificial intelligence drives a rebound in spending by corporate customers.\n\nGrowth in the $270 billion cloud infrastructure market, a cash engine for Amazon.com, Microsoft and Alphabet, gives the clearest sign yet that AI investment is bearing fruit after investors drove those stocks to record highs, thanks to optimism about the emerging technology.\n\nMany big customers have started spending again on cloud computing after pausing last year to cut costs, executives and analysts said.\n\nAmazon, the last of trio to report on Tuesday, said its cloud computing arm AWS grew 17% in the January-to-March period, above Wall Street's 15% growth estimate, and hit a $100 billion annual run-rate for the first time.\n\nPerformance was consistent at Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud, which grew above expectations at 31% and 28%, respectively, in the first three months of the year.\n\n\"Looking across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, it is clear that two things are happening simultaneously – AI is contributing to growth, but also the rest of cloud spending is accelerating,” said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria.\n\nFor several years cloud infrastructure providers enjoyed growth rates as high as 60% and demand shot up during the COVID-19 pandemic as more businesses moved online. However, firms had to realign expectation last year as customer pulled back spends in an increasingly challenging business environment.\n\nThe industry has been at the forefront of adopting AI and customers had begun to buy the new functionality at a rapid pace, executives said.\n\n\"The number of Azure AI customers continues to grow and average spend continues to increase,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company earnings call, adding that more than 65% of the Fortune 500 companies were Azure OpenAI Service customers.\n\nAI services contributed 7 percentage-points in growth to Azure, up from 6 percentage points in the Oct-Dec quarter.\n\nMore than 60% of funded generative AI startups and nearly 90% of genAI unicorns were using Google Cloud, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said on his company's earnings call last week.\n\n\"There is an inevitable and continuous migration of workloads to the cloud and consolidation of IT spending going towards large platforms, including the hyperscalers,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria.\n\nHyperscalers are cloud providers with a large network of data centers and wide range of services, and are often preferred for end-to-end workload support.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)\n\nView comments",

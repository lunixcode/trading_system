    "step1_result": "Primary check: The article title mentions \"Nvidia Stock\" so it is related.\n\n1. **Categories:** Market Sentiment, Speculative or Rumor-based News, General Market Trends (depending on the content of the article, it could also fall under Technological Developments if the \"$1 Trillion Opportunity\" relates to a specific technology).\n\n\n2. **Simplified Category:** Market Sentiment (most likely, given the title's phrasing).\n\n\n3. **Summary:** The article discusses a potential $1 trillion market opportunity for Nvidia.  The exact nature of this opportunity is not clear from the title alone.  It is presented as something Nvidia investors \"need to see,\" suggesting it's significant and potentially positive.  However, without more context, it's difficult to assess the credibility and nature of this opportunity.\n\n\n4. **Impact**: 4\n\nThe title is vague and sensationalized.  While a \"$1 trillion opportunity\" sounds impactful, without further details, it's likely speculative.  The market may react mildly initially based on the headline, but sustained impact depends on the article's content and the credibility of the information.  The lack of a reputable source reduces the impact score further.\n",

    "step1_result": "Primary check:  The article title suggests it relates to Nvidia (NVDA) and its CEO.  Proceeding with analysis.\n\n\n1. **Categories:** Market Sentiment, Speculative or Rumor-based News (depending on the content of the \"great news\"), potentially Product Announcements, Strategic Changes, or Technological Developments depending on the nature of the news.\n\n\n2. **Simplified Category:** Market Sentiment (most likely, pending further details).  It could also be Product Announcements or Strategic Changes if the news is concrete.\n\n\n3. **Summary:** The article title states that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has delivered \"great news\" for investors.  Without the article body, it's impossible to determine the specific nature of this news.  It could be anything from a new product announcement to a positive outlook on future earnings.\n\n\n4. **Impact**: 4\n\nReasoning: While the headline is positive, it's extremely vague.  \"Great news\" is subjective and lacks concrete information. Without knowing the actual news, it's difficult to assess the market impact. It could be highly impactful, but it's more likely to generate moderate interest until details emerge.  Therefore, a lower impact score is assigned due to the lack of specifics.  A higher score would be warranted if the news itself was disclosed.\n",

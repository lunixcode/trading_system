# TODO List: Data Source Integration for Market Prediction

This repository aims to build a robust system for market prediction by integrating a variety of data sources beyond traditional news feeds. Below is the prioritized TODO list for integrating these data sources:

## 1. **Social Media and Sentiment Analysis**
- [ ] Set up an **X (Twitter) Listener** for key influencers like Elon Musk and Donald Trump.
- [ ] Integrate trending hashtags and sentiment analysis for finance-related topics.
- [ ] Build a scraper or API connection for **Reddit** (e.g., r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets) to monitor discussions.
- [ ] Add sentiment analysis for key financial YouTube channels using transcript or comment analysis.

## 2. **Macro and Geopolitical Events**
- [ ] Create a feed to monitor **political announcements** (e.g., White House, European Parliament).
- [ ] Integrate real-time updates from **central banks** (e.g., Federal Reserve, ECB) on interest rates and policies.

## 3. **Commodities and Energy Data**
- [ ] Incorporate real-time oil and gold prices from financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
- [ ] Build a connector to pull **energy market reports** (natural gas, electricity prices) from public or private APIs.

## 4. **Alternative Data Sources**
- [ ] Add weather pattern data (e.g., hurricanes, droughts) relevant to agriculture and energy sectors using **NOAA** or similar APIs.
- [ ] Integrate **supply chain indicators** (e.g., container shipping data) for global trade insights.
- [ ] Explore **satellite imagery** sources to track macroeconomic trends (e.g., construction activity).

## 5. **Consumer and Business Sentiment**
- [ ] Set up Google Trends integration for tracking search queries related to economic concerns.
- [ ] Add feeds for consumer confidence surveys and business outlook indices (e.g., University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index).

## 6. **Technical Market Data**
- [ ] Monitor **options flow** for unusual activity via platforms like Unusual Whales or Tradier API.
- [ ] Build an alert system for significant **volume spikes** in stock trading.

## 7. **Regulatory and Legal Updates**
- [ ] Automate tracking of **SEC filings** for insider trading (Form 4) and other relevant disclosures.
- [ ] Add patent feeds for tech companies (e.g., USPTO API).

## 8. **Industry-Specific Feeds**
- [ ] Create a listener for **tech news sources** (e.g., TechCrunch, Wired) to identify potential breakthroughs.
- [ ] Integrate clinical trial updates for biotech stocks (e.g., FDA Clinical Trials Database).

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Develop predictive models for each data source using machine learning and statistical analysis.
- [ ] Implement dashboards for visualizing multi-source data in real time.
- [ ] Optimize the integration pipeline for low-latency alerts.

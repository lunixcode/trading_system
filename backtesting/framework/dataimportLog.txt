System Overview
We've developed a data pipeline for processing and aligning financial market data, focusing on price data and news events. The system is built with modularity in mind, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance.
Key Components

HistoricalDataManager


Primary data loading component that handles raw data retrieval
Manages price data in minute-level CSV format
Handles news data from JSON files
Implements caching to optimize repeated data access
Organizes data by symbol, year, and month structure
Handles timezone and datetime consistency


DataValidator


Ensures data quality and consistency
Validates price data relationships (High/Low/Open/Close)
Verifies news data completeness and timestamp validity
Filters out news items with placeholder timestamps (00:00:00)
Provides detailed validation reporting and error tracking


DataPreprocessor


Core data alignment and transformation component
Supports multiple timeframes (5min, 15min, 30min, 1h, 1d)
Resamples price data to different time intervals
Matches news events to appropriate price periods
Uses index-based referencing for efficient news storage
Maintains data integrity across different timeframes

Data Flow

Raw data is loaded through HistoricalDataManager
DataValidator checks and filters the data
DataPreprocessor aligns and transforms the data
Final output includes:

Aligned price data at multiple timeframes
News references linked to price periods
Separate news data storage for efficient access



Current Capabilities

Can process minute-level price data into multiple timeframes
Matches news events to the correct time periods
Handles timezone-aware timestamps
Provides efficient data storage and retrieval
Supports detailed debugging and error tracking
Generates separate files for each timeframe

Technical Features

Efficient memory usage through index-based news referencing
Robust error handling and validation
Comprehensive debugging capabilities
Flexible timeframe handling
Clean data organization and storage
Cache system for improved performance

Output Structure

CSV files for each timeframe containing:

Price data (OHLCV)
News count per period
News indices for reference


Separate JSON file containing complete news data
Debug logs and validation reports

Design Principles Applied

Separation of concerns between components
Modular architecture for easy expansion
Robust error handling and validation
Efficient data storage and retrieval
Clear debugging and logging capabilities

This system forms the foundation for adding fundamental data and creating a comprehensive market analysis platform. Each component is designed to be extended while maintaining clean separation of concerns and efficient data handling.
